president abbas to the white house for his first visit to washington in quite a whilealmost  years ago it was on these grounds that president abbas stood with a courageous peacemaker thenisraeli prime minister yitzhak rabin here at the white house president abbas signed a declaration of principles  very important  which laid the foundation for peace between the israelis and palestiniansthe president  mr president you signed your name to the first israelipalestinian peace agreement you remember that well right and i want to support you in being the palestinian leader who signs his name to the final and most important peace agreement that brings safety stability and prosperity to both peoples and to the regionim committed to working with israel and the palestinians to reach an agreement but any agreement cannot be imposed by the united states or by any other nation the palestinians and israelis must work together to reach an agreement that allows both peoples to live worship and thrive and prosper in peace and i will do whatever is necessary to facilitate the agreement  to mediate to arbitrate anything theyd like to do but i would love to be a mediator or an arbitrator or a facilitator and we will get this done peace also means defeating isis and other terrorist groups these groups are a threat to all people who cherish human life i know president abbas has spoken out against isis and other terrorist groups and we must continue to build our partnership with the palestinian security forces to counter and defeat terrorismi also applaud the palestinian authoritys continued security coordination with israel they get along unbelievably well i had meetings and at these meetings i was actually very impressed and somewhat surprised at how well they get along they work together beautifully but there cannot be lasting peace unless the palestinian leaders speak in a unified voice against incitement to violate  and violence and hate theres such hatred but hopefully there wont be such hatred for very long all children of god must be taught to value and respect human life and condemn all of those who target the innocent as part of our efforts to move

been disproportionately harmed by the dramatic increase in regulation since  declining in number by  percent since the presidents progrowth agenda including instituting what he has called a st century glasssteagall will allow these banks to spend less time complying with unnecessary requirements many of which were designed to police much larger entities and more time infusing their communities and local small businesses with capital its also the start of small business week today ivanka trump will be participating in a conversation at the united states institute of peace with sba administrator linda mcmahon and the vice president will deliver remarks at the national small business week awards program later this afternoonback to the presidents schedule after speaking with the community bankers members the president had lunch with vice president pence secretary of state tillerson and secretary of defense mattis as well as national security advisor mcmaster before meeting separately with secretary tillersoni also want to mention this morning that fema held a severe weather coordination call to discuss impacts on the remaining threat for continued severe weather across portions of the southwest to the mississippi valley which has already killed five people in texas secretary of homeland security kelly participated on the call and the white house is in contact with local residents in these affected areas well have those communities in our thoughts and prayers and encourage everyone to follow the directions of their state tribal and local officials to stay safefinally let me run down what were expecting for the presidents schedule this week tomorrow hell present the commanderinchief trophy to the united states air force academy wednesday the president will host the president of the palestinian authority for an official visit and on thursday hell host a national day of prayer event and as i mentioned last week he will then attend an event commemorating the th anniversary of the battle of the coral sea aboard the united states senate intrepid and meet with the prime minister of australia ill continue to update you on the schedule throughout the week and with that your questionsjillq  thank you very much so i wanted to go back to the comments that the president made this weekend on face the nation on healthcare regarding preexisting conditions he said specifically that the bill he wants to sign would mandate the preexisting conditions be covered can you talk us through a little bit of what he meant there was he referring to something he wants to push to include in the bill was he talking about the language thats already in theremr spicer well i think both in the sense that the macarthurmeadows amendment ensures that preexisting conditions continue to be covered but then obviously as this bill hopefully passes the house this week or whenever it does and then goes through the senate and the house this is an issue that is important to himq  how does he ensure though that those people actually are treated affordably i mean there was an estimate from aarp that if youre looking just at the highrisk pool the premiums can be as high as over  for somebody what is he doing to ensure that that doesnt happenmr spicer so theres two things  and i think he mentioned in the same interview  just to be clear right now under obamacare as it collapses on its own weight people who have preexisting conditions are really the most vulnerable because if you have an insurance system that no longer is able to provide care to those who need it then  i think weve talked about this before  you have a card without coverageso what the president is doing is ensuring going forward as we attempt to repeal and replace it that coverage of preexisting conditions is at the core of that so that is something that he is ensured is in the current bill and well continue to push for to make sure that coming out of the senate and going to conference its there as welljohnq  couple things for you sean if i could first of all what do you say to conservatives who feel like they didnt get a whole lot out of this spending bill there was no money for the wall no cuts to sanctuary cities funding for planned parenthood was maintained what do you say to those conservativesmr spicer lets take them in order but i think the president got a lot out of this bill most specifically  billion to help rebuild the military i think that is something that he was very proud to campaign on and is delivering on thats probably the biggest thingwith respect to border security he got  billion in the current language thats posted i think thats a significant  and remember i think people have to keep in context were talking about  funding right so this is something that most presidents would walk into office and that would have been done because the last congress didnt do this under president obama we have an opportunity to get some of the presidents priorities infused for the last five months of thats a big step forward and something that hell continue to fight for in  when the fiscal year starts the end of september we will have an opportunity to really infuse the presidents priorities but i think theres a lot there and theres also  dc school choice was something that we felt very strongly about making sure it was back in theres no obamacare bailout the coal miners is something that the president felt very strong on making sure they got taken care of that happened so theres a lot in this bill that i think  of the priorities that he put forward onq  but clearly he did give up on some thingsmr spicer no i mean i think on the planned parenthood thing in particular  but again remember this is  funding this is something that he wouldnt normally even had a shot at because it should have been done so infusing his priorities in the  budget cycle is actually something that hes been able to have a say in which is a big deal for the remaining five months the  budget will address those things but this is a down payment on border security its a down payment on his ability to rebuild the military and repealing and replacing obamacare will address a lot of the other healthcare issuesq  and the other  i had on the pending visit of duterte from the philippines chris coons said that the president is giving his stamp of approval to human rights abuses governor john sununu on the other hand said this is part of the unpleasant things that presidents have to do whats the white houses perspective on duterte and him coming heremr spicer i think it is an opportunity for us to work with countries in that region that can help play a role in diplomatically and economically isolating north korea and frankly the national interest of the united states the safety of our people and the safety of people in the region are the numberone priorities of the presidentmikeq  i wanted to ask you about the tax deductions the white house has talked a little bit about that as a way to curb big tax breaks for the rich are you looking at any other policy changes when it comes to limiting breaks for the top  percentmr spicer well were at the beginning of this process but i think you saw from the briefing that was given the other day the focus on this is really on lower and middleincome americans the doubling of the standard deduction means that a family of four that is making  right now theyre getting a  deduction which means in a lot of cases youre going to see a family pay zero taxes at the lower end of the economic scale thats a big deal for them to really help put more money back in their pocket and help them take care of their familytreyq  on healthcare there seems to be a new optimism from the white house how confident is the president that he will get a healthcare bill past the house this weekmr spicer i think the president has made it clear that hes not instituting a timeline ive said this before and ill continue to say that we feel confident the direction this is going we see more and more members come on board a lot of the changes that were made make the bill not only better but garner greater support so we feel very good about itq  on north korea today the president told bloomberg he was open to meeting with kim jongun if the conditions were right how does the president define the right condition to have this meetingmr spicer well theres a lot of things that go along with that and thats the key thing under the right circumstances was i believe the phrase he used and i think that is something in keeping with our  consistent with the policy expressed by secretary tillerson as wellweve got to see their provocative behavior ratcheted down immediately theres a lot of conditions that i think would have to happen with respect to its behavior and to show signs of good faith clearly conditions are not there right now but i think the president has made it clear as secretary tillerson had the other day that if the conditions if the circumstances present themselves well be prepared to but theyre clearly not at this timeq  thanks sean picking up on healthcare its believed possibly that you might be down  republicans might be down to maybe just a handful of votes away here we are at  pm monday afternoon is this the closest that you think youve gotten i know you dont want to talk about timelines but is this as close to maybe getting to that magic  number that youve talked aboutmr spicer well sure were not going to  once we get  well stop counting and i think the speaker gets that but as i mentioned to trey i mean were getting closer and closer every day so i would assume that today were closer than we were a week ago but were not there yet and that decision is going to be wholly within the speaker the majority leader and the whip to let us know when theyre going to open that vote upq  doddfrank  the president just gave an interview in which he said i am looking at that right now he goes on to say theres some people that want to go back to the old system right so were going to look at that meaning potentially breaking up the banks so breaking up the banks going back to glasssteagall is that something that hes just looking at or is that something that is a preference of his at this pointmr spicer i think i mentioned in the opening hes looking at a st century glasssteagall that is something that weve talked about at the beginning he mentioned this on the campaign trail it shouldnt be a surprise to anybody but it is something that is currently being looked at sarahq  thanks sean so youre saying that youre not confident that the votes are lined up behind the healthcare bill so this morning when gary cohn said that the bill was ready to be brought to the floor did gary cohn misspeak mr spicer no i just  i would never want to get in front of the speaker thats up to them we have a good whip count i think we feel very good about where we are and where its headed but ultimately the speaker and the house leadership determine when to call a vote i think that we know that when the vote gets called well feel confident that its going to be able to passzekeq  thanks sean the president on the campaign trail raised alarm about federal debt and deficits his spending bill get us through the end of the fiscal year doesnt include any of the offsets really that the president requested in this years budget is the president  will the president sign this agreement that does increase the federal deficitmr spicer i think we got a number of the presidents priorities included in the cr when we are at the final point the president will make a decision but right now hes pleased to see the plusup for the military hes pleased to see a down payment on border security hes pleased about the dc opportunities scholarships theres a lot that hes pleased inand i think again as i mentioned to john were getting a shot at the  funding which should have been done last year q  he called for keeping that balance essentially keeping mr spicer i understand that and i think that obviously this is something that required  votes in the senate we couldnt have our entire way on this but were five months away from having a  budget and i think the presidents priorities will be reflected much more in thatannieq  on president duterte he made comments when asked about press freedom he said that journalists are not exempt from assassination did the president know about those comments and about his record on human rights when he extended the invitation for him to visit the white housemr spicer i mean the president gets fully briefed on the leaders that hes speaking to obviously but the numberone concern of this president is to make sure that we do everything we can to protect our people and specifically to economically and diplomatically isolate north korea and i think when you look at what he is doing in terms of building that coalition of countries in that region to do it i think this is hopefully going to have  well he knows  im not going to tell you every single thing thats in his brief but hes well aware of  when he speaks with a leader he gets briefed on a lot about their  what theyre doing what theyve done thats all part of the brieflauraq  i wanted to ask you about the future of sebastian gorka can you tell us why hes leaving the white housemr spicer there is no personnel announcement at the time i have no belief that he is currently leaving the white house so theres nothing to update you on with respect to that and we wouldnt comment on personnel matters at this timemaraq  thank you sean i have a healthcare and israel question on healthcare when the president talks about a guarantee for preexisting conditions current law says insurance companies have to sell to people with preexisting conditions and they cant charge them more than someone else in that area is that the guarantee that the president wantsmr spicer so the bill does not remove obamacares guaranteed issue requirement thats it and on the community ratings the bill would allow states to waive obamacares community rating requirement if certain conditions designated to preserve access to coverage for people with preexisting conditions are met and there are reduced average premiums increased enrollment stabilize the market stabilize premiums for those with preexisting  the bottom line is to try to give the states flexibility to actually get that premium downq  right but people with preexisting conditions would continue to get access but not at the same price as other peoplemr spicer well the idea is actually they would create a highrisk pool the idea is actually to create a system where it gets the premium down for them as wellq  right but highrisk pools could still charge them much moremr spicer you cant  youre right when i say the whole goal of this is to give the states the flexibility to get lower premiums thats the goal all around is to make sure that the system that we employ gets it downq  the president turned to bibi netanyahu at that press conference and famously said settlements are not helpful israel is going to build  new homes in east jerusalem does he think that netanyahu is snubbing himmr spicer im sure that well continue to have conversations with the prime minister and q  is he aware of thatmr spicer im not going to  that will be something that president will continue to discussjohn two johns q  let me go first john gizzi all right sound goodmr spicer thats quite a negotiation laughter we may need youq  from the art of the dealq  thank you sean i wanted to ask about some news the president made this morning in an interview that he conducted with bloomberg in that interview he talked about the possibility of raising gas taxes to pay for infrastructure spending of course the president has put forward the idea of a trilliondollar infrastructure spending plan can you talk a little bit more about this possibility of raising gas taxesmr spicer so what the president said during that interview is that folks from the industry had come to him and expressed to him how the deteriorating roads were affecting their ability to deliver goods and services throughout this country and that they had expressed a willingness to see something like that as a way to help pay for and repair the roads and bridges and that he said that he out of respect would definitely listen to them and consider itq  as it relates to this idea that the gas tax in america hasnt been raised for some time what makes the president believe that now is the time that republicans who have been opposed to this idea would be open to this ideamr spicer i think youre missing the  he did not express support for it he expressed that a group that had met with him expressed support with it and that he out of respect would consider their request thats it there was no endorsement of it or support for it he was just relaying what another industry group had shared with him about how to pay for the roads and bridges that need to be repaired and the impact that deteriorating roads and bridges are having on their ability to operate and to deliver goods and services and frankly the cost that it is having on their trucks on their infrastructureq  you have not foreclosed this possibility of raising mr spicer people ask the president all the time please consider the following policy and he has an open mind i mean there are people on both sides of the aisle different backgrounds that come in to see the president and ask him could you please consider this will you keep an open mind on it and i think thats frankly what the president was doingjohn gizziq  thank you sean thank you john laughterq  and thank you johnq  i have two questions one foreign policy and one on domestic politics first last wednesday the kremlin outlawed the open russia movement the premier opposition group to the ruling regime in russia and the following day security forces were forcibly closing down open russias office in moscow and other places does the administration have a statement on thismr spicer i do not i would refer you to the state departmentq  all right my second question is on sunday congresswoman ileana roslehtinen a term veteran of the house past chairman of the house foreign affairs committee announced her retirement her statement comes on the heels of a similar announcement by congressman chaffetz and before that only a few weeks ago lynn jenkins of kansas thats three respected republican house members all calling it quits is the president concerned about the number of republican house members who do not want to be on the ballot next time and are leaving congressmr spicer no and respectfully i would say that there are two groups of folks i mean in the congresswoman roslehtinen i think shes been here  years and she q  twentyeightmr spicer twentyeight and so shes just decided its time to retire in the case of congressman chaffetz he announced that  you know that doesnt  i dont think that theres any belief that you have to stay here for     years theres always going to be churn between election cycles between members in both parties who decide for a number of reasons to go back home and i think thats a healthy part of the democracy and thats frankly something that our framers saw and its a citizen legislature so to some degree thats a healthy part of it but we feel very confident about where we standjenniferq  sean the president opted not to continue obamas tradition of holding an easter prayer breakfast but he is holding a national day of prayer event was that a scheduling issue or did he think  what was the thought process theremr spicer i really dont know i know that we wanted to do this national prayer breakfast this sunday and i think that youre going to see a lot of folks represented i dont know enough about obamas thing how far back it went each president is going to have their own traditions and i think this is one that the president  you know that morning after youve got the easter egg roll and theres a lot going on this is his way of starting a tradition here at this white house to bring faith leaders from a variety of backgrounds here to the white houseeamonq  thanks sean back to glasssteagall for a second as you can imagine the presidents comments today are getting a lot of attention on wall street so can we be just very clear about this  does the president favor breaking up the big banksmr spicer i think he talked about on the campaign trail and hes mentioned it before this idea of a st century glasssteagall a modernization of it and were not at a point where were ready to roll out details of that yet this is something as the president said in that interview he is actively looking at options and considering things were not in a position to make any announcements on this at this timeq   take any steps toward that behind the scenes that were not aware ofmr spicer well i mean hes obviously been briefed by his advisors secretary mnuchin and others have given him ideas and thoughts to ponder we have nothing to announce at this time toddq  thanks sean so the lack of border wall funding raises a question of just how serious the president is about getting the border wall constructed is it not urgent is it not an emergency anymore to build this barrier what is the timetable and deadline that he has in mindmr spicer well make no mistake the wall is going to be built the president has made it very clear we have five months left in this fiscal year were getting  billion for border security theres a lot that can be done with that weve got a lot of things that happen before the wall is built in terms of planning technology gates there is a lot of things they can do to prepare for that wall being constructedour big  this was a down payment for  and as we get ready for fiscal year   that will start in the beginning of october  this will be a major priorityq  so it will be built is there a time certain is there a deadline by the  bymr spicer that it will be completed i know the president wants it done as quick as possible there have been bids that have been put out part of what the homeland security department is reviewing now are not just the costs but the timetable for a lot of that so as we move through the planning phase thats definitely going to be part of the consideration but obviously the president wants this done as soon as possiblejonathanq  coming back to north korea the president didnt just say he would be open to meeting with kim jongun under the right circumstances he said he would be honored to meet with him this is somebody who has starved his own people somebody who has threatened to destroy the united states just last week he put out a video showing the capitol getting destroyed by north korea fighters how could he be honored to meet with kim jongunmr spicer well the president understands the threat that north korea poses and he will do whatever is necessary under the right circumstances to protect our country from the threat that they pose so q  how could that be an honormr spicer i guess because hes still a head of state so it is sort of  there is a diplomatic piece to this but the bottom line is the president is going to do what he has to do right now hes building a coalition in the region to isolate north korea both economically and diplomatically to get the threat  to take that threat down and so  but that is his numberone priority right now is protecting this country and our peopleq  what did he mean when he called him one smart cookie or a pretty smart cookiemr spicer well i think his point was  he went over this in the interview  that he assumed power at a young age when his father passed away and there was a lot of potential threats that could have come his way and hes obviously managed to lead a country forward despite the obvious concerns that we and so many other people have he is a young person to be leading a country with nuclear weapons and so that set aside i think the president recognizes the threat that he poses and is doing everything he can to isolate that threat and to make sure that we bring stability to the regionmargaretq  sean on north korea and then on philippines on north korea both of the presidents comment on kim jongun and what secretary tillerson said you seem to be making the offer that we could have direct talks with north korea who is going to be leading thosemr spicer no no  i just  again i think q  is that the white housemr spicer i think that the key part of the presidents statement was under the right circumstances and that is the key and those circumstances do not exist now this is consistent with what secretary tillerson said the other day but i think that if north korea continues down a degree of provocative behavior then those circumstances will never be there but we want to hold out the possibility that if north korea were ever serious about completely dismantling its nuclear capability and taking away the threat that they pose both to the region and to us that there is always going to be a possibility of that occurring that possibility is not there at this timeq  but who would lead that is that the white house or the state departmentmr spicer were not  were so far away from that possibility existing to start identifying an individual would be highly prematureq  and on the philippines when you have been asked about president duterte and his human rights record you continue to say the effort here is to isolate the philippines from the north korea part of this coalition to isolate north koreamr spicer well its also to build a  yesq  are you suggesting that the philippines has some sort of an appropriate contact with north korea are you suggesting that we are requesting greater access perhaps to their military bases what is it exactly mr spicer well i think theres an economic piece to this as well and im not going to go into  thats part of the reason that i think the president wants to meet with him and im not going to get ahead of their discussions but i would suggest to you that there are multifaceted ways and areas in which not just the philippines but other countries in the region can help play a role both economically diplomatically and otherwise to help deter the threat that they poseq  are you suggesting now that they are trading or conducting some kind of financial transactions mr spicer no im not  like i said q  when you say economic piece thats what i just want to clarify mr spicer right and again im just going to let  the president will have an opportunity to speak with him about those objectives at this time im not going to get ahead of that discussionglennq  sean two quick related questions first of all you just described kim jongun as somebody who led his country forward at an early age the president has invited duterte who as annie pointed out has talked about assassinating journalists the president put out a statement after erdogan won his referendum congratulating him he said kind things about putin during the campaign said kind things about saddam hussein does the president have a thing with these totalitarian leaders does he admire something about the way these guys conduct themselvesmr spicer the president clearly as ive said understands the threat the north korea poses having someone with the potential nuclear capability to strike another country and potentially our country as some point in the future is something the president takes very seriously and so the idea that he is doing everything diplomatically economically and militarily to consider every way to prevent that threat from taking on the united states is something q  what about this whole package mr spicer i understand unfortunately those are the neighbors there are certain things  those are the countries in the region those are the countries that can be helpful as we move forward to try to prevent the threat that they poseq  one followup question on sunday chief of staff priebus talking to this gentleman right here said with respect to the libel laws and the first amendment talking about news outlets that printed false articles i think its something that weve looked at how that gets executed or whether that goes anywhere is a different storyis that a project that is currently being worked on by the counsels office can you just tell me the status of that who is pursuing thatmr spicer i think the chief of staff made it very clear that its something that is being looked into substantively and then both logistically how it would happen but thats nothing new its something the president talked about on the campaign trailq  is the counsel actually investigating thismr spicer i will not go into it but ill just tell you that q  sean two questions one on  just to clarify on north korea were those conditions that you laid out to the earlier question are those the conditions that would have to be met before there was any meeting  ie that north korea would have to agree to totally disarm its nuclear program stop threatening their neighbors are those the conditionsmr spicer i think those are some of the conditions theres going to be a whole host of ones that we determine that the state department determines in consultation with the president that have to be metas i mentioned we are so early into this process that i dont see this happening anytime soon but i think that as the president said under the right circumstances those circumstances arent present today and there would have to be significant change for that to even be a possibilityq  sean on a separate subject the chief executives of united airlines will be on the hill tomorrow is the president at all  does the president think that congress should pass any laws after the incident last month where the passenger was dragged off should there be some  should there be more done to protect passengers on airplanes from those type of incidentsmr spicer i think theres two things one is i think the industries probably need to  and have  said that they have taken a look at how theyre handling a number of issues within that both in terms of compensation how theyre handling passengers who are on planes so theres an industry component and then ill leave it up to congress to decide whether or not its appropriate to address it legislatively once there was a piece of legislation then we could  we would have an opportunity to weigh in on thatceciliaq  thanks i just want to ask you to clarify something else the president said he said i dont stand by anything how is the american public supposed to digest that supposed to trust what the president says when he himself says of his own comments i dont stand by anythingmr spicer what are you referring toq  just in this cbs interview with john dickerson in the oval officemr spicer im just  i need more contextq  about wiretappingq  it was about wiretapping he was asked to  if he still believes president obama is a bad or evil guy do you still stand by those comments and the president said i dont stand by anything mr spicer no that was a long backandforth exchange thats why im asking for the context but i think the point is he clearly stands by that thats something that he made very clear if you look at the entire backandforthq  sean i have two questions on the philippines first is president trump comfortable with the leaders support of extrajudicial killings of drug users in the countrymr spicer obviously theres a human rights component that goes into all of this and so its a balance we want to make sure that our country our people are protected this isnt a simple yesorno kind of situation youve got a country in north korea that possess a nuclear weapon and is looking for the appropriate delivery system to potentially do harmi think the president recognizes that the numberone priority is the protection of our people the safety of our people and the safety of the people in the region and so its not just a question of eitheror its a question of priorities and balance theres a lot that the president talks to these leaders in private about and i think you saw that case in egypt where sometimes that kind of diplomacy privately talking about them and building a relationship can achieve results not just for our people but for their people and discussing how  the human rights issues but i think that it would be a mistake to assume that the president because we dont put out statements publicly chastising leaders at every call means that the president is not q  but what mr spicer hold on hold on let me answer the question i think the president understands the value but he understands the balance and the reason that the president is building an effective coalition and is getting results around the globe in reasserting americas place is because he understands the type of diplomacy and the type of negotiating and the type of dealmaking that actually gets real results for our country so i think its not a balancing  its a balancing act but the president is getting real resultsq  sean i have a second question if you dont mindmr spicer okayq  looking at  there are three open patents with the philippines government one from trump trying to get the trump patented to  from ivanka trump for her clothing line how do you respond to concerns about potential conflicts of interest with the leader of the philippinesmr spicer i think the president and ivanka have done everything in compliance  made it very clear and i would refer you to the trump organization cherylq  i just want to clarify something you said to zeke is there a possibility that the president would not sign this spending agreementmr spicer i mean hes very pleased with the priorities but i just want to  lets wait until its presented to him but hes obviously very pleased with how his priorities were addressed in the cr and i have every expectation that he would sign it but lets just  lets wait until its on his deskq  are you still on track to issue the full fiscal year  budget is it midmay or do you have a date for thatmr spicer my understanding was it was still midmay but id want to consult with director mulvaney firstq  thanks sean just wanted to first ask what your expectation and whats your hope for the meeting with president abbas on wednesday and secondly is the president still considering moving the us embassy to jerusalem and will that be discussedmr spicer that is still being discussed by staff and then what was the first question im sorryq  abbasq  the first question is your expectations going forward whats the hope from thismr spicer the presidents ultimate goal is to establish peace in the region and so i think hes going to  thats obviously the goal and the discussion that hes going to have with the head of the palestinian authority but thats going to be a relationship that he continues to work on and build with the ultimate goal that theres peace in that region between israel and the palestinian authorityalexisq  sean quick followup on infrastructure the president has been talking about a major infrastructure package for more than a year and in the campaign but it doesnt seem very clear right now what the mechanism is for the construction of whatever it is that he wants to push forward he talked about maybe attaching it to the reconciliation package for healthcare he talked about maybe doing that with the tax package can you update us on  is that still very preliminary in its invention does he have clear ideas and whats the mechanism and timing to get that donemr spicer i think he does hes been working on that with his both economic and policy team but this week were a little busy with the cr and healthcare he laid out the tax package last week but it is clearly still up there on the priority list lets get through this week  and then hopefully have some additional details moving forward but he has been very clear that infrastructure package is something that he wants to get done and get moving q  this yearmr spicer this year oh absolutely and its just a question of when he wants to announce it but i think for this week were pretty focused on getting the government funded for the last five months of  and getting the  and getting healthcare done as soon as we can so with that ill see you guys tomorrow have a great day thank youend pm edt

2017-05-01,Remarks by the Vice President to Independent Community Bankers of America ,the kennedy garden pm edtthe vice president thank you on behalf of the first family welcome to the white house great to have you here on this breezy day in the kennedy garden and to be able to talk with all of you about the extraordinary difference that independent community bankers make in the life of americas economy in the life of americas families every daythe president will be joining us in just a few minutes but i have the great privilege of being able to share just a few thoughts about the presidents priorities and the gratitude that we all feel for the leadership and the support that each of you providebut first let me invite you to give one more of round of applause for linda mcmahon and the great job she is doing at the small business administration applause we are all glad for her tireless work for job creators i grew up in a small business family in a small town in southern indiana and i can tell you that having an entrepreneur and an american success story like linda mcmahon as our administrator at the sba is already making a difference in the life of our economy and were truly grateful for all of her worki want to thank all the members of the independent community bankers of america who are here since  the icba has given voice to small and community banks all across america its a testament of your impact today you boast more than  members all across the greatest nation on earth give yourselves a round of applause that is an incredible impact applauseand your businesses  i know firsthand your businesses are pillars of the community you cant go to a softball game you cant stand in the bleachers at a basketball game without seeing your banners hanging and supporting every worthy cause in every community where you liveall told community banks are also bigtime employers   people work each and every day issuing loans to a stunning  trillion in value to working families small businesses and family farms you might be small in community banks but you have a big big impact on a growing american economy applausei want to thank your icba leadership  cam fine scott heitkamp tim zimmerman and preston kennedy  for putting todays even together i know the president is really looking forward to greeting you and welcoming you here your tireless work is making a difference far beyond the lobbies and hallways of your banks the president knows what all of us know when community banks are strong america is strong applauseand let me say ive heard this businessmanturnedpresident many times talk about the challenges facing businesses all across this country and the financial crunch that we have faced in recent years the president i know is personally committed to helping you succeed and to break down the barriers that you faceand i can promise you under president donald trump doddfranks days are numbered applause i dont have to tell you about the harmful effects of this failed law doddfrank restricts your customers choices their freedom to make financial choices that are best for them their families and their businesses it creates a twoclass system for banks it truly does  one for big and for small it erodes accountability and gives bureaucrats more control over your business more than  pages of red tape have already been issued under doddfrank costing money time and resources that oftentimes community banks just dont have to spare since doddfrank was passed seven years ago its heartbreaking to think that america has lost more than  small banks and only five new banks have opened in the wake of the passage of this failed lawthe damage of course doesnt end at the doorways of your banks doddfranks is costing our economy in almost incalculable ways hurting working families small businesses and family farms that depend on the services that each one of you provide the burden i know falls heaviest on small businesses the engines of the american economy and the drivers of job creation we see great enthusiasm in the american economy since president trump raised his right hand  days ago applausebut you all know that enthusiasm that willingness to take risks among our small business owners and family farmers has got to be met with resources and the ability of our small and community banks to be able to provide those resources in an orderly way so that america can grow in big cities and small towns is essential inaudible your banks do the lions share of small business lending and unfortunately the share of loans going to small businesses has dropped by more than a third under doddfrank but thats all about to changethe simple truth of the matter is that the policies that have advanced from the last administration simply cant continue so dismantling doddfrank is a major part of the presidents legislative agenda and we will get it done applausein february president trump issued an executive order on what he called the core principles for regulating the united states financial system and i know youre all familiar with it he laid out a vision for real reform that will ensure the integrity of our financial services in this country while still being able to fuel economic growth the president is determined along with our entire administration to seek a system that fosters economic growth and vibrant financial markets empowers families to make their own financial decisions enables companies to be competitive here and across the world as they do business and restores accountability and transparency to the federal bureaucracyto that end the president ordered our treasury secretary steve mnuchin to evaluate every federal law and regulation in light of this vision and that work is going forward vigorously the president i know is truly grateful  truly grateful  for the leadership in congress that will be working with our administration in the days ahead but special thanks to congressman jeb hensarling the chairman of the house financial services committee for his strong leadership turning the page on doddfrank and bringing it once and for all to an end applausehis choice act we believe is an enormously important step toward real reform and would unburden community banks and spur growth the choice act is a commonsense bill that repeals doddfrank and empowers consumers and businesses not bureaucrats and lawyersour administration will continue to work with chairman hensarling and the rest of congress on this vital issue i promise you that were already making some progress and i promise you with president trump in the oval office were going to get the job done and unleash the boundless potential of the american economy with our community and independent banks helping to drive that recovery applausethis is absolutely one of the presidents top priorities and he wanted me to come out here today and make sure and share the substance of that with all of you and i just would say as i close that its a joy to see all of you some of you remember me back in the day when i was a member of congress fighting against doddfrank you can imagine how humbling it is for me to be standing before you today here at the white house as vice president to a president who understands the american economy and is going to take america back in the direction of the policies that will ensure a boundless economic future its incredible and you all have been a part of ityouve been a part of continuing to make this case and carrying this case forward to the american people and were all grateful but i just want to encourage you  i do believe your buttons are right  laughter america loves community banks in smalltown america and mediumsized cities all across the america youre the difference makers youre the folks that dont so much look at a balance sheet but you look people in the face because its not a matter of seeing forms filled out its a matter of people that you know you see them walking up and down the street you see them at places of worship you see them at ballgames each and every day you make decisions not so much by running a calculator but by calculating in your heart who that person is and the character of the men and women that are building the enterprises of your communitiesmy dad is gone now about  years my dad ran a small business a gas station business in a small town but i know how he spoke about our local bankers and the ability that they gave him and his company the opportunity to grow you do that in a very real sense our community banks make dreams come true every day for working families for small businesses and i just want you to know from the bottom of my heart we have a president who knows that too we have a president who has lived the american dream and we have a president who understands the vital role that our community banks play in ensuring that every american has a chance to live that dream as wellso with that ill step off the stage and the next voice you hear will be the president of the united states of america stay tuned applauseend am edt

2017-04-28,Press Briefing by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross on an Executive Order on Trade Agreement Violations and Abuses ,james s brady briefing room pm edtms strom thank you guys all for being here this is a briefing on executive order on addressing trade agreement violations and abuses with secretary ross it is on the record offcamera embargoed until  pm eastern time and if you guys please would speak up when you ask your questions make sure we can all hear you over here that would be great and with that ill kick it on off to the secretary and remember to keep your questions on topicyes on the record embargoedsecretary ross thank you its me again laughter i notice the audience is dwindling i hope thats due to friday rather than to the speaker but in any event this is the executive order addressing specifically violations and abuses under existing trade agreements so thats what differentiates it from some of the earlier ones that we had this is focusing more narrowly on the agreements themselvesnow not all of the freetrade agreements that we have result in deficits but some of the larger ones also result in some of the larger deficits in all trade relations with companies other than freetrade companies are governed by the wto the world trade organization so thats really the grandparent of all trade arrangements that we haveand as far as i can tell there has never been a systematic evaluation of what has been the impact of the wto agreements on the country as an integrated whole so its trying to find violations and abuses it calls for a report within  days but this particular report it calls for not just outlining the problem or problems but also proposing the solutions  alternative solutions to them so thats the guts of it now why what is it really all about i think everyone here is generally aware that we do have a big trade deficit its some  billion  not counting our trade surplus in services just counting the trade deficit in goods and its  billion counting the trade deficit in  after netting out the benefits of the exported services so thats the general parametersthis order involves the department of commerce and the us trade rep jointly to conduct that review and so maybe it would be useful to you to hear where are some of the big deficits so that you can put it into perspective china alone is the numberone deficit its  billion this is on the goods part alone so the base is  billion and china is  percent of that japan is next at  billion which is  percent germany  billion   percent i might point out that germany doesnt negotiate separately trade agreements it negotiates them as part of the european commissionmexico which is obviously part of nafta  billion or  percentireland  billion  percent  also part of european commissionvietnam  billion  percent italy again part of the eu  billion  percentsouth korea  billion we do have a freetrade agreement with south korea and thats  percent of the problemmalaysia  billion  percent india  billion  percent so thats the top  of the agreements but for the most part as you can tell from that the largest portion is with the countries that are really just covered by wto rules as opposed to countries that are covered by individual freetrade agreementswhat are some of the problems under wto its someodd countries are participants in the wto and the vast majority of those are countries that export to us and in most cases export more than they buy from us the us only has  freetrade agreement partners and thats a very small number those of you who have been at some of the earlier briefings know mexico for example has more than twice as many freetrade agreements by number as we do and has them with the most important areas such as the european commission which we do not haveso its anomalous that the us with its huge trade deficit has relatively fewer freetrade agreements than do much smaller countries like mexico and i think that points out one of the issues with our current relationship with the world trade namely mexico and others have had very big external tariffs on many many goods us is the least protectionist country many goods come in totally free and others have little tiny tariffs like  percent countries like mexico frequently have   percent even more than  percent tariffsthe implication of that is when they negotiate a freetrade agreement with another country they can give something important to that country by way of tariff relief if we for example only have a  percent tariff on autos and no tariff on steel what is it that the other country gains by making a freetrade agreement with usso in a weird way the fact that we have been so freetrade oriented historically actually impedes our ability to make new freetrade agreements and thats something that i dont think is very well understood so i think it would actually do your readers a very good service to point out to them that the fact that we have made so many unilateral concessions impedes having more freetrade agreements with other countries its an oddity of the way that weve behaved in the pastthe other thing about it the president has talked a lot about reciprocal concept namely if we have a country that has big trade barriers against us we should logically have similar trade barriers against them and if theres a country that has relatively few barriers against us we should have relatively few against them the only problem is the world trade organization has whats called a most favored nation clause meaning that of all the countries with whom we do not have a freetrade agreement we must charge the same tariff on the same item to those  each of those countries as we charge to the others so thats a significant impediment toward getting to anything like a reciprocal agreementthe second thing is the wto doesnt really deal very much with nontariff trade barriers and it doesnt deal very effectively with intellectual property rights and doesnt deal very much effectively with the whole digital economy so there are some real gaps within itbut there are those problems that i mentioned then theres also the structural problem of the dispute resolution mechanism takes a very long time and given the composition of the wto panels often were defeated when people come and appeal it because if the people on the panel are mostly people who are doing the same thing as what youre complaining about its a little bit hard to get them to vote for youso those are just a few illustrations of the kinds of issues that were liable to come up with and try to figure out some solutions also wto is a very very bureaucratic organization their main meetings occur four times a year well when you think about how dynamic trade is and how rapidly it changes the idea of a leisurely fourtimesayear meeting schedule its really not very consistent with dealing with problemsand then the last thing  if you look at the last annual report that the wto published its filled with complaints that there are more trade actions more actions alleging violations than there used to be and they lament that as protectionist it apparently doesnt occur to them that perhaps the cause of it is more violations by more countries but thats the reality thats why the trade actions are being brought is that theres more and more dumping all over the place but theres an institutional bias on their part toward the exporters rather than toward people who are being beleaguered by inappropriate importsso that gives you a little flavor for where this study may be headingq  i have two quick questions for you when is the executive order going to be signedsecretary ross i believe it has already been signed has it notms strom tomorrow q  where and will it be a public ceremony aide it will be signed at the ames tool company i think its camp hill pennsylvania it will be done prior to a rally at secretary ross yeah im going out there with the president tomorrow q  mr secretary just one followup on the structure of the report that will be issued in  days you talk about having also solutions not just identifying the problems will this be productbased countrybased a combination of the two can you talk a little bit about how youre looking to structure this reportsecretary ross well some of the issues will be productbased such as those industries where theres global overcapacity you really have to deal with that on a product basis some will be more countrybased because theyll be based on behavioral issues of individual countries and some will be bothq  sir if you find the outcome of this study as an institutional bias against the us would a retaliation move be to  from the united states  to recommend a withdrawal from the wtosecretary ross well we havent done the study and we havent presented the president with all of the alternatives certainly as any multilateral organization theres always the potential for modifying the rules of itq  you mentioned that many eu countries  because the way the eu works in negotiating as a bloc versus negotiating individual trade deals  could the united states and president trump consider a separate bilateral deal with the eu thats sort of correlates to what he was asking about withdrawing from gatt i mean if gatt is so unfair and this dispute resolution process is so unfair and the most favored nation clause keeps us from making these bilateral trade agreements why isnt withdrawal on the tablesecretary ross didnt say it was on the table or off the table what i said is the report hasnt yet been done hasnt yet made recommendations and therefore neither has the president taken action based on it but theres always the potential for amending organizations charters like the wto and particularly when youre in the position that we are  look were the numberone importer in the whole world our deficit exactly equals the cumulative surplus of the rest of the world were also the numberthree exporter in the world so it would be kind of a funnylooking world trade organization not to have its numberone importer and its numberthree exporter but i wouldnt dismiss the potential for in all of these  in the bilaterals in the multilaterals and with the world trade  i wouldnt dismiss the potential for seeking modificationq  mr secretary then how does the order track with the presidents decision this week to renegotiate nafta does this study that youre about to embark on does that provide the framework for identifying issues that the president will then seek to modifysecretary ross well nafta will certainly be part of this study  a big part of it and thats important because that is also fulfilling one of his many campaign promises i think the amazing thing is that with all the problems of trade that weve had over the years there never had been this kind of systematic detailed review of what went wrong and part of what the order will say is to try to compare what actually happened with the forecast that was made at the time those agreements were entered intothose of you who have been covering trade for a while will know that whenever weve ventured into any of these agreements the forecast has always been that it would be a jobcreator well to the degree that those forecasts are wrong it would be very useful to figure out why were they wrong and what can be done to fix itq  was the development of this executive order parallel to that internal discussion of what to do with nafta is it an outgrowth of that is it separate how does this relate to that decisionsecretary ross there isnt a day that goes by that the president doesnt discuss some aspect of trade its all a continuous activity because trade is so important to the economy its so important to the administrations fourpoint plan and its so important to the promises he made during the campaign and as youve noticed this president unlike many others is really trying his best to live up to his campaign promises q  sir could i ask you a question in terms of the historical perspective on this as you know traditionally american administrations have been willing to tolerate some trade deficits in terms of geopolitics  because trade doesnt exist in a vacuum its to cement alliances its to spread capitalism spread prosperity what has changed in this moment in history for the united states that its perspective on those things is shifting so the united states is more focused on the dollars and cents of these than it is on the geopolitical implications of themsecretary ross well i think whats changed is that manufacturing has shrunk severely in this country weve lost some  manufacturing factories in recent yearsand middleclass america part of the reason why its been so devastated  and frankly part of the reason why it pretty much voted for the president  is theyre fed up with having their jobs go offshore theyre fed up with some of the destructive practices that have resulted in that so in effect the country said in this last election its about time to fix these thingsand the president heard that messageq  does that mean that the united states is no longer as interested in the other things the military alliances spreading capitalism spreading prosperity around the worldsecretary ross no i didnt say that at all its a question however of proportionality there is always a geopolitical content to everything take for example south korea obviously one of the issues there is they live in a very tough neighborhood right now and so it is a question  and theyve shown that theres some political fragility there too with the removal of the last president and i think its around the ht of may there will be an election for a new president so there are always geopolitical issues there are often military issues the question is what proportion of the decisionmaking weight do you give to which of these other conceptsq  will the review include a review of studies which hold that the loss of manufacturing jobs in a lot of cases was due to the increasing productivity and advances in technology not necessarily jobs being moved to other countriessecretary ross sureq  will it review those studies and whether theyre validsecretary ross well this is not to say that the only problem for jobs is trade agreements that would be silly to saybut were not going to be able to impede technology in its growth nor do i think we should do so so we will have to face the challenges of artificial intelligence of driverless cars of robots of god knows what else that some young scientist in a garage will come up with but those things we cant control we must try to deal with the things we can control and to some degree we have some control over our trade arrangementsq  two questions for you the first one how does this kind of line up or compliment the other study that youve been asked to do which is the industrybyindustry countrybycountry look and then also to follow up  go aheadsecretary ross yes that focused on the sources it didnt get into as much the causes this is really trying to say of all the possible causes what portion of the problem is attributable to the various trade agreements so its much more precise in its focusfor example we are a net importer of petroleum even with all the good growth in shale oil well so that means those imports are going to occur quite independently of anything else you cant really put a blame to thatso were not saying that all imports are bad some imports are actually quite necessary and not all imports from developing countries are because of dumping some are simply because of lower cost structure but its important to sort out those which are from the agreements themselves or from persistent violations of them because those are things we can try to correctq  just to follow up on a previous question the president obviously has talked about his decision to try to renegotiate nafta also made some comments  i believe it was yesterday  to reuters about the south korean agreement will you as youre making this assessment be taking those comments into account and for instance not recommending a complete withdrawal from a trade agreement that the president has said he wants to renegotiatesecretary ross well withdrawal is the most extreme form of renegotiation and so to me it would really be more of a last resort if you cant negotiate or cant get to negotiatenow its also possible that some of the parties here will refuse to negotiate and if they do then that doesnt leave you an awful lot of alternativesq  sir may i ask you about a specific thing in steelsecretary ross yesq  you describe an approach like i think which is a part of the presidents policy of buy america and i know that you launched investigations  article  investigations on steel and aluminum and maybe if you could explain what products that will cover and also this buy america thing will it include private investors like will you require private investors to also buy american steel  for instance for pipelines that you buildms strom this briefing is on this particular executive order if you have questions on those previous onesq  if you could just please secretary ross well there was an order issued on pipelines you can read that for yourselfq  a lot of the constituencies that put trump in office have expressed concerns over renegotiating nafta and trade deals in general particularly iowa farmers  for example corn farmers in particular what is your message to these farmers who export a lot of their crop to mexico who are worried that renegotiating these deals or ending them altogether could hurt their bottom linesecretary ross sure well agriculture is one of the things that we do the best of any country in the world and it is a huge source of export for us so i can understand why they would have fear because fear of the unknown is the worst fear but our approach to the negotiations will certainly not be to undertake activities that would endanger the farmers the farmers are very big sources of our exportour idea in the negotiations is to try to do better with exports not to try to truncate themq  but president trump has said uncertainty in business is tantamount to not knowing what your next move is and some of these farmers have said im not sure how much crop i need to plan how much i need to budget for because they dont know whats happening with nafta do you understand those secretary ross if i were a farmer i would plant as much as i can logically plant under todays environment and i would  certainly wouldnt shrink my production just because theres going to be some renegotiation i think that would be silly the fact is that most of the rest of the world is incapable of feeding itself so it isnt as though this is a discretionary purchase by people nor in most areas of farming is there gross overcapacity in the world so if some country would cut back on what they purchase from us by going to someone else as a competing vendor then whoever else had been the customer of that competing vendor is going to have to buy our stuff anywayi think its highly unlikely that worldwide food consumption will go down just because we renegotiate trade agreementsq  just two quick questions can you clarify  i know you went over this but im still not really understanding  how does this report differ from the earlier reports that this report is going to be looking for solutions where the other one was just looking at kind of the sources of trade deficitssecretary ross well the difference here is its focusing on the agreements themselves rather than on behavior of individual countries so the agreements are part of the targetq  the agreements including the wtosecretary ross yeah yeah sure the wto is the biggest of all trade agreements theres  countriesq  and also on south korea which you talked about earlier and some of the geopolitical things there if that trade agreement was going to be renegotiated what are some of the things that you would be looking for from south korea secretary ross i think were wandering a little bit off the topic here if as and when we actually begin negotiations with south korea and especially as we conclude them that would be a great time to ask that question q  you describe the wto as bureaucratic how would you rate its effectiveness as an organizational body does it need to be modernized is it outdated secretary ross well i think any entity thats been going for a real long time needs to be updated i dont think theres any question about that i think theres also no question that we need some sort of an arbiter of international tradeso at the foot level theres a need but when you get down to the ground level the real question is implementation and how well has it been implemented thats where issues come on also it was developed for the most part many many years ago when the world was a very different place from what it was  what it is today you go back to the gatt which is the father of world trade in those days the us ran a consistent trade surplus so the whole viewpoint that our government had in negotiating the wto was starkly different from what it is today we were also in the process of trying to help countries rebuild themselves after world war ii so the whole playing field is different and therefore its not so illogical that some structural changes in the organization might be warranted q  i wanted to ask you secretary ross lets let this  shes been very patientq  thank you for china i wanted to ask there are a lot of violations of different trade practices lets say especially fair trade practices on the side of the chinese government by sponsoring the local companies and basically depressing also the activity of foreign companies working inside china so there are multiple  im sure you know all about that so the question is will those problems be somehow tackled in this particular order or maybe some other wayssecretary ross no because one of the weaknesses in the current wto is it doesnt really deal very effectively with what i would call nontariff trade barriers and a lot of what you mentioned are nontariff trade barriers but theyre quite formidable onesand so thats one of the things that really is lacking in the wto q  would this particular order  will that be investigated as well with thissecretary ross well it would be looked at sure because one of the elements that you want to look at in any treaty is not just whats in it but whats left out of it q  what offices in commerce will be performing this reviewsecretary ross i beg your pardonq  what office at commerce will be tasked with performing this reviewsecretary ross well weve now  with so many reviews were probably going to use a lot of the  people we have there thank you very muchq  any indication about the hiring freeze on commercems strom were going to have a factsheet on this dont worry guys its just going through approval so ill send it to everybody and i think you noticed our email system has been a little iffy so if you need to email menataliemstromwhoeopgov and as soon as its ready ill send it to everybodyq  is this the last eo of the week that hes signing  laughter ms strom i dont know that but  i couldnt say one way or the other but i certainly hope so for

speaking later so ill try to keep this short and let his words carry the daybefore we left the president signed an executive order on offshore energy development i know the president made a statement on this order and during the signing ceremony secretary zinke gave you a little detail during that briefing that occurred last night the main takeaway is that the order maintains our responsibility as stewards of the environment while moving us forward towards energy security combined with the presidents previous actions reducing regulations and promoting clean and safe energy development we are on the right track toward american energy independenceas you guys know were on our way to atlanta where the president will speak to the national rifle associations leadership forum its a great way to end an incredible week leading up to the presidents official th day in office which is tomorrow one of his most historic achievements was getting judge gorsuch confirmed to the supreme court in his first  days the first president to have a supreme court confirmation since  i know the nra is glad to have a justice in that seat who will be such a staunch defender of our constitution the president is

holding this rally during the correspondents dinner is there any message hes trying to send with those two things happening concurrentlymr spicer well respectfully its also his th day in office so i respectfully suggest that its not just about the correspondents dinner its rather an opportunity for him to talk to voters that elected him and what hes been able to accomplish in the first  daysso i think its a sharp contrast obviously between whats going to be happening on his first  days and talking to voters about what hes been able to do and how much more there is to do and how committed he is to seeing the next  days and the  days after that produce real results for americansq  can you give us an update on where things are with the spending plan i know there was a bill for one week but

south korea he mentioned the thaad missile system is he going to ask the south koreans to pay for thatmr spicer i think well have more on that for you at some point obviously the president has talked a lot during the campaign about our national security and what were doing as a country in making sure that our taxpayers and our funding is  that weve got a lot of work to do at home that were spending a lot of money on other places and we want to discuss whether its nato or other places where were spending a lot of money and make sure that other countries are contributing equally as wellq

the pc principals committee is for the different stakeholders to be able to provide input for the decisionmaking process for the president it was chaired by nec director cohn and the participants gave him feedback in the different areas  diplomatic secretary perry had some energy issues administrator pruitt was there so again a lot of this is an opportunity for the key stakeholders in this arena to share their ideas opinions and do further work on areas that need some followup before presenting to the president with various optionsq  when will they do thatmr spicer we should have an answer

especially congresswoman ileana roslehtinen and all the hispanic business and community leaders who are here with us today thank you for being here on this historic daythis saturday marks the end of president trumps first  days in office and as this period draws to a close its worth reflecting for just a moment on the optimism and the progress that is sweeping across america thanks to the leadership of president donald trump for nearly  days president trump has been delivering on the promises that he made to the american people one after another he picked a worldclass cabinet which were adding to today which is working around the clock to implement an agenda to make america great again in justice neil gorsuch president trump kept his promise to nominate a supreme court justice in the mold of the late and great justice antonin scaliapresident trump has been putting america first  rebuilding our military restoring the arsenal of democracy and hes signing legislation to give our veterans the care that they deserve in fact in now just short of  days president trump has signed  bills into law  executive orders  historic numbers that show that not only is president trump a man of his word president trump is a man of action applauseand since day one the president has taken decisive action to get our economy moving again and restore opportunity and prosperity for every american family president trump i always like to say has a threepart agenda jobs jobs and jobs and to kickstart jobs and growth the president has been slashing through mountains of red tape hes renewed focus even earlier today on american energy and american energy independence and just a few short days ago the president put forward a plan for the biggest tax cut for individuals and businesses in american history applause and the result more than  new jobs have been created so far this year smallbusiness confidence has skyrocketed to its highest level in decades and for manufacturers the highest level in two decades and company after company is announcing plans to invest in our country for the benefit of american workers american jobs and americas futurethe fact is that president trumps leadership has been making a difference every single day and were just getting started and with our new secretary of labor alex acosta the president and i are confident that we will accomplish even more for working americans and job creators all across this nation applause alex acosta is the right man at the right time to lead the department of labor born the son of two cuban refugees alex showed his potential from his earliest days earning both his undergraduate and law degrees from harvard university he went on to clerk for justice samuel alito on the third circuit court of appeals and after a few years in private practice and as a professor at george mason university school of law he entered into the noble path of public service in  president george w bush appointed alex to serve as a member of the national labor relations board only one year later president bush appointed him to be the assistant attorney general for the civil rights division at the department of justice and two years after that he became the us attorney for the southern district of floridaalex i know youve tried to retire from public service more than once laughter in  you did it when you became dean of florida international university college of law but president trump has now called you back  called you back to public service to bring you character your intellect and your ability to serve the country and we couldnt be more grateful your service past present and future is truly a testament to the american dream and to your own character and your own abilities i want to thank you again thank you for stepping up to serve our country and to serve working americans at such a time as this given your long and distinguished record your integrity and your leadership the president and i are absolutely confident that as  with you as our new secretary of labor we will continue to restore opportunity prosperity and growth for working americans now and for generations to come applause and so on behalf of president trump it is my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office step aside and well make it official the oath is administered applausesecretary acosta i want to thank president trump vice president pence and the members of the senate for the privilege of serving as secretary of labor i want to thank my wife jan her unyielding support and her heartfelt love means the world to me its amazing to be loved and i love her back more than words can really say and so thank you applause my daughters delia and rosalia are amazing they have followed this process in their own way when president trump nominated me i had to sit down and explain to them that we were if confirmed moving to washington and they wanted to know why and so i sort of took a pause and i tried to explain what being secretary of labor means in words that a four and then sixyearold could understand and this is what i said i said daddy helps his students find good jobs and so the president has asked daddy to help people all over america find good jobs too applauseand then it struck me explaining the responsibilities of the secretary of labor to a four and a sixyearold really helped me encapsulate so many of the responsibilities of the department of labor because as the vice president said it is about finding and helping and supporting jobs and job growth my parents fled a cuban dictatorship in search of freedom they met in high school they fell in love and they married young neither attended college what an amazing nation this is that the son of refugees who forwent an education to support a family could be standing here in this room taking this oath administered by the vice president of the united states that is what america is about applause my parents experience is part of who i am and frames my perspectives that i will bring to the important responsibilities of the department of labor we have a lot of work to do too many americans have seen jobs go overseas too many americans have seen jobs filled by foreign workers and too many americans see that jobs are available but that they dont have the skills or the experience to fill those jobs the skills gap is real and needs to be addressedsupporting americans ability to find good jobs safe jobs is a priority for president trump for vice president pence and for me i am honored and i am profoundly humbled to be called in service of this important effort thank you very much applause end pm edt

all know that i was up here earlier this morning off camera with some of your kids it was a pleasure to be able to share a little bit of the white house experience with them and i hope they enjoyed it i think some of you have trained them very well i hope they enjoyed their visit and im glad they got an opportunity to visit with the president and the vice president today we have a bunch to talk about today about what the president has been doing and hes got an executive order coming up so im going to try to get through it allthis morning the president welcomed the president and mrs macri of argentina for an official visit as you know the president and first lady of argentina just left so we will have a readout for you very shortly on that at  pm the president will be signing a memorandum on aluminum imports and threats to national security so well try to keep this briefing on timei know secretary ross spoke about the memo that the president signed yesterday but i want to reiterate that the american aluminum industry is in trouble having declined down to the lowest levels of aluminum that weve produced since  it is critical for our national defenses  the army ground vehicles and the air force jets the navy warships but american companies are producing less aluminum than before especially in the highpurity aluminum thats used to build things like the f the f and the csthe secretary of commerce has initiated an investigation to determine what effect our reliance on imported aluminum has on both national and economic security the memo the president will sign today similar to the memo he signed on steel elevates this investigation and directs the secretary to prioritize its completion this memo combined with similar action on steel is an important step towards fulfilling the presidents promise to put american steel and aluminum back into the backbone of our countrythe president has been speaking about revitalizing the american manufacturing industry for quite a long time another one of the presidents most significant pledges has been to ensure that the men and women who have served this nation in our military have the care treatment and support they so greatly deserve so later this afternoon the president will go to the department of veterans affairs where he will sign an executive order that will take serious action to fix the broken va system through the establishment of the new va office of accountability and whistleblower protection which will remove and discipline federal employees and managers who have violated the publics trust while protecting employees that speak out about wrongdoingthe president will be joined at the va by several veterans and their spouses who have experienced or witnessed firsthand the poor quality of treatment that unfortunately too many of these heroes have received at va facilities  including sergeant michael verardo who lost his leg and arm when he stepped on an ied in afghanistan in  and his devoted wife and caregiver sarah the president is making it clear that the delays and improper care experienced by these veterans is unacceptablethe presidents action today comes on top of the signing of the veterans choice improvement act last week which gives more veterans the option of seeing the doctor of their choice without traveling long distance or waiting for va care these actions which are only the beginning of his plans to modernize the va the president is making it clear that the trump administration will not accept anything but the best for those who have served our nationtoday as with every day this week as we approach the th day in office for this president he is continuing to follow through on some of the biggest promises that he made to the american people on monday he hosted a working lunch with members of the united nations security council reiterating his dedication to making america a leader in the world on tuesday he prioritized the protection of the farmers and ranchers of americas heartland by establishing the interagency task force on agriculture and rural prosperity today he took several important steps to review massive federal land grab by the previous administration under the antiquities act an egregious federal overreach that was yesterday actually and today as i mentioned hes taking action on trade and veteransas we speak of trade i know last night you saw a readout of the presidents call with president pea nieto and prime minister trudeau as the president just said the president and the prime minister called him and asked him to renegotiate nafta rather than terminate it the president has a great deal of respect for these two countries and their leaders and he said that he would hold on the termination while we negotiate a better and fairer deal for america and its workers but the president also made it clear that if the parties are unable to agree on a deal that is fair for american workers and companies after renegotiation  giving renegotiation a good shot he will move forward with terminationand with that ill take some questionsq  sean what changes in nafta does the president hope to achieve through renegotiationmr spicer i think when you look at the various sectors  its obviously being a multilateral agreement  there are areas in canada sectors where theres agriculture manufacturing services  that we look on both of them where i think theres both a modernization recognizing the world has changed and also some trade imbalances and issues that have come up and also frankly some areas that fall outside the scope of nafta as it was negotiated at the beginning that i think we want to look at it obviously the issue of dairy came up so thats an area that we want to look at as well and so part of this is to look at not just the existing agreement but areas and sectors and industries that have fallen outside or because over the last couple decades have not kept up with the promises and the commitments that were made but thats  weve got a ways to gomattq  thanks sean as you know under both the reagan and bush administrations concerns about tax cutsfueled deficits were dismissed with promises of growth and were hearing that same sort of rhetoric now the deficit increased a great deal under both those administrations after the tax cuts whats different about the presidents plan that wont lead to the same sort of ballooning of the deficitmr spicer theres a few things number one we outlined those principles yesterday weve got a lot of work to do with congress and i think its moving in a very positive direction theres a lot of payfors as they call them in this proposal that will continue to be refined as we move forward in negotiating with congress so theres a lot of thingsbut i think the president laid out a plan that achieves  or seeks to achieve three basic things one is economic growth and job creation two is a simplification so that the american people can actually file their taxes in a rather normal process that doesnt require a ton of money and time and three is to do stuff that makes  create a better business climate that makes sure that manufacturing and job creation people want to hire here and that we help the middle class those are the three guiding principles that the president hasas we do that one of the things that you recognize through a lot of the models here is youre going to achieve greater economic growth its something that we saw both following the tax cuts in the kennedy administration and the reagan administration i think that we can achieve greater growth economic prosperity and job creation under the plan that the president laid outjohnq  thanks a lot sean you may have seen the news about the office of the inspector general announcing that its launched an investigation into the payment that the former national security advisor michael flynn received prior to becoming the national security advisor from rt  russia today  which is an entity of the russian government whats your reaction to that first of allmr spicer i think thats appropriate if they think that theres wrongdoing then the departments inspector general should look into thatq  are you satisfied with the vetting that was done of general flynn by the transition team before he came on board as the national security advisormr spicer so thats a great question i appreciate you bringing it up lets walk through that for a second general flynn was a career military officer who maintained a highlevel security clearance throughout his career in the military his clearance was last reissued by the obama administration in  with full knowledge of his activities that occurred in  as you point out so the issue is  he was issued a security clearance under the obama administration in the spring of  the trip and transactions that youre referring to occurred in december of  from what i understand so obviously theres an issue that as you point out the department of defense inspector general is looking into we welcome that but all of that clearance was made by the  during the obama administration and apparently with knowledge of the trip that he took so thats how the process works and i welcome the department of defenses igs reviewjordanq  if he wasnt fired by the president for lying to the vice president would he still have a job today right here at the white housemr spicer i will just say that i think the president made the right call at the right time and its clearly paid offjordanq  given the progress that congressional republicans have made on the healthcare talks does the president want a vote on that bill this weekmr spicer he wants a vote when they have  votes and i feel very good about the progress thats being made to get to that number and i think speaker ryans comments this morning indicate that its moving in the right direction and that should be good news for everyone in america as we move towards a system that creates a healthcare system that serves us and that makes sure that premiums dont skyrocket like they are now and that were able to see the doctors that we want to see and have plans that have competition in themeamonq  if theres no vote does that mean the president wont be disappointedmr spicer i think the president wants a vote and wants a healthcare system as soon as possible but thats going to be dictated by the speaker and the majority leader and the majority whip in the house when they feel they have the votes that being said as weve now maintained for the last several days we feel very positive about the work thats being done to get to that and the reaction that were having as you recall there was a lot of members that initially had some problems and were very pleased with the reaction  the public reaction that they are having to what is currently been negotiated and i think its only getting bigger and thats welcome newseamonq  thanks sean the presidents tax plan were getting a little bit of mixed signals here on exactly what his vision is in terms of retirement savings can you lay out what the presidents vision is for ks and particularly tax deductions surrounding those does the president imagine removing those deductions entirely along with the other deductions or is he going to protect thosemr spicer so the secretary of the treasury and director cohn yesterday both talked about that the current plan right now both protects charitable giving and mortgage interest and thats it as we move forward with negotiations in the house and senate that plan will continue to flesh out but one of the benefits of the tax plan on the individual side in particular is by expanding the standard deduction to  for a married couple the really effectively creates a bracket of zero taxes for many many americans and thats good news were going to see more and more americans get some relief that they so desperately needq  these tax deductions though of course comes with its own group its own lobby its own interest groupmr spicer yesq  they fight very hard for these things are you guys prepared for a battle on all those tax deductions eliminating all of those i mean politically thats a big liftmr spicer well i think the one interest that the president is going to fight for are the american people and the american worker thats what he made his entire campaign about is putting america first and hes going to fight hard his special interest is the american people and making sure that whether its putting more money in their pocket or making sure that they economic growth leads to more jobs and greater manufacturing thats the one interest that hes fighting for every dayso well do battle with whoever we have to to achieve a greater outcome for americans and american workerszekeq  just one more gary cohn told us the retirement savings was protected q  two on general flynn first you said the obama administration had reissued his clearance last yearmr spicer yesq  so is the implication there that should be taken that if the trump administration was the one adjudicating his clearance this year he would not have been issued that clearance now that the white house knows everything that there is about general flynnmr spicer no i think im just making sure people understand the process and how it works and the way a process works is that if you have a top security clearance you fill out a form theres an investigation done you are reinvestigated every five years if you are able to maintain that clearance and then whoever owns that clearance whether its the fbi or the department of defense goes out does the investigation in between that period youre responsible for updating the information that you provided in accordance with the agency that issued thatmy only point is is that when general flynn came into the white house he had an active security clearance that was issued during the obama administration with all of the information thats being discussed that occurred in  so im just  i guess my only point is to explain how the process works and who adjudicated thatq  youre not implying wrongdoing in the part of mr spicer no thats why the department of defense inspector general is looking into this to see how that process works but i think its important for folks to understand that when someone applies for a clearance they get that clearance its issued at the top security clearance level for five years and that the person who has been issued it then has a legal obligation to update the issuing agency any variances in what they supplied as informationq  finally when you were here on february th the morning after general flynn was fired by the president you said that the president asked him to leave the white house  the situation regarding the phone call with the russian ambassador and the vice presidentmr spicer rightq  but also a series of other questionable instances i was hoping now you can provide some more information now that more  some of his financial dealings in particular now have come to light is that what led to his termination at the white housemr spicer look i think we addressed it at the time and i think as q  not this mr spicer no no but  thats right and i dont  i think the president made the right decision at the right time and he continues to stand by itmajor q  to follow on a couple of things that have been brought up to you today johns question  not the process but your own vet meaning the transition  are you satisfied that that met the standard that should have been met with michael flynn and then if there are any regrets that this white house has about bringing him in knowing what you know about him now and seeing a behavior that would be plainly inconsistent with the standard that candidate trump set during the campaignmr spicer well with respect youre saying our process the process is every government employee who is eligible for a clearance goes through the same process so its not  we dont have a unique processq  but thats not the only question you asked michael flynn  it couldnt possibly be the only you asked himmr spicer when someone comes in the question is do they have a clearance if not they apply for one and if they have one then the clearance is made available from the issuing agency thats  you cant  the whole reason you have a clearance is so that someone is found whether or not theyre q  as you just said to zeke it was not just the episode with the russian ambassador it was other instances those things have come to light any regret about bringing him in mr spicer look ill just say the president q   to have this done and knowing what you know now did you miss something and you regret michael flynn inmr spicer i think the president made the right decision at the right time and its been pretty clear that q  he regrets bringing him inmr spicer no im just saying he made the right decision and i think weve moved forward from that decision and the decision standsq  on the question about  gary cohn and the treasury secretary left us with the implication yesterday when asked about retirement savings that they were protected what you just said has indicated they might not be can you help us understandmr spicer i cant let me get back to you on that i was not clear on that distinction i will have the treasury folks read that out for youq  so general flynn came in with just the obama administration vetting is that right seanmr spicer thats how everyone  okay q  because thats the impression youre givingmr spicer it isq  general flynn came in and he walked through the door with just the clearance that was conducted by the obama administration that doesnt make any sensemr spicer sure it does the same way that when you applied for a credential to the white house press briefing room when you were here q  im not the national security advisormr spicer hold on just let  hold on let me explain the answer to you jim calm down the kids have gone q  thats a serious questionmr spicer and im trying to answer it major this is the answer when you apply  hold on listen  when you applied to come here to this briefing room as a member of the press you apply and you fill out certain forms with the secret service to have your background run when i came in here in january th the people that had been cleared the day before were cleared on the th and st et cetera we didnt rerun your background we trust that when you were cleared the first time if you were cleared on december th or january th that you were still  that your background check still cleared every individual who came into this white house either applied for a security clearance or had one everyone in the government goes through the same sf process  every single person and so why would you rerun a background check on someone who was the head of the department  the defense intelligence agency that had and did maintain a highlevel security clearance thats it theres no difference between administrations  when you come in from one they rerun it the reason they grant them for five years is that its a very extensive background where they check your contacts your places of residence your employment they go out into the field they do a lot of that work and then youre required to maintain updates to that clearance they readjudicate it every five years that occurred in this case and now the department of defenses inspector general is looking into it thats how q  and when congressman cummings accuses this white house of a coverup you say whatmr spicer i say thats  i was frankly taken back by his comments todays because theyre frankly not true the department of defense was the issuing agency for general flynns sf we referred them to the department of defense who owns and issued his security clearance and they got a copy of it thats how the system works the documents that he requested he received so with all due respect he got the documents that he requested our job  they sent a form letter to multiple agencies asking for a copy of this what we did was properly refer him to the issuing agency and department and said this is where you got and he got itq  are there no other documents that you have at this point that could be turned over to this committee that would be relevant to this investigationmr spicer not that im aware of at this point what they sent to us  they asked for the sf that we referred them to the department of defense  thats great two is they asked for a contract  all copies of his speaking engagements from the speakers bureau i believe he was referred to the speakers bureau for those contracts and three is they asked for all foreign contacts that he may or may not have had since the incident occurred that theyre questioning before his employment to the white house i think weve complied with every document that theyve looked forkaitlanq  thank you two questions one does the president still feel that mike flynn should seek immunitymr spicer i think mike flynn should do what his counsel advises him best to doq  but does the presidentmr spicer i dont  i have not asked him but i believe that general flynn should do what his counsel advises him to doq  and secondly the president said he wants to start renegotiating nafta as soon as today has he notified congress about that yetmr spicer weve been in communication with congress for a while on thisyes adamq  the president tweeted this morning about puerto rico  begin to default on their debt may st pending some kind of solution there are millions of investors in the united states senior citizens  who may not be aware that they hold funds within munibond mutual funds that expose them to a default in puerto rico is there anything the white house should do or the administration can do one to safeguard those senior citizens and their investments and two to prevent an increase in cost to states and municipalities that may have to pay more to borrow when they access the munibond market if puerto rico defaultsmr spicer i think the issue itself is extremely complicated in the sense that the presidents tweet and the presidents discussion revolves around the continuing resolution to fund our government our government needs to get  there needs to be a continuing resolution effective this friday the president has done everything possible worked extremely hard to with congress to ensure that we maintain the government  keep the government open the democrats at the last minute have come in and thrown a lot of monkey wrenches into the ability for this to get done despite the president doing everything that he can to show good faith to keep this goingso its not just a question of  they keep moving the goal post and the issue right now is to make sure that we do whats in the best interest of this country and our people by keeping the government open thats the issue at hand right now not a question of whether or not that can be dealt with there are ways that that issue can be dealt with but throwing it in in the last minute and trying to gum up keeping the government open is probably not the most effective wayq  i understand that the cr is different but if puerto rico defaults with or without the cr  is the administration working with puerto ricomr spicer again  and i think that that is a separate issue that needs to be addressed by congress in terms of how it gets done i think that the method right now is to make sure that we do everything in our power to keep the government open effective fridaygeorgeq  as the tax plan evolves and we start to get details do you believe it is a fair question for anyone to ask how that plan personally affects the president and his familymr spicer i think the presidents plan right now is something that every american should worry hopefully about how it affects them and i think when you look at the ways that this is going to benefit middleclass americans middleincome working americans grow businesses that should be  and i think frankly that is the concern of most americans out there theyre worried about their job theyre worried about whether their company is growing and expanding theyre worried about whether or not theyre saving enough money and how much theyre paying in taxes and i think what the presidents numberone goal right now is is to provide middleincome and lowerincome tax relief to americans and thats what his goal is and i think thats frankly what most americans goal isq  but is it a fair question to askmr spicer thats up to every individual to ask but i would guess that most americans would applaud what the president is doing to spur economic growth and job creation in this countryceciliaq   if middleincome americans should feel empowered to ask how this plan affects them why is it that secretary mnuchin today could not guarantee that no one in the middle class would pay more under this proposalmr spicer i think everyone in the middle class should know that this presidents plan is going to make sure that they have more in their pocketq  so there is a guarantee from the white house thats the position of the white house right now  that middleclass american should not mr spicer the position of the white house is that the goal of this presidents tax plan is to provide them and lowerincome people with more money in their pocket and a tax cut yesthank you guys very much i look forward to seeing you at the signingend pm edt

2017-04-26,Press Briefing by Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin on Executive Order Improving Accountability and Whistleblower Protections  ,james s brady press briefing room pm edtsecretary shulkin hi everybody this is my first briefing so im glad to see you all tomorrow the president is going to be coming over to va in the afternoon and is going to be signing an executive order that is entitled improving accountability and whistleblower protectionas you know accountability is an important issue to us at va and something that were focusing on to make sure that we have employees who work and are committed to the mission of serving our veterans and when we find employees that have deviated from those values we want to make sure that we can move them outside the va and not have them working at vathe house has passed a bill already on accountability the senate is working hard to do the same the president is committed to this issue and so therefore will sign an executive order what this accountability and whistleblower protection office does is it establishes a specific office with an executive in charge that will report directly to me as secretary so that we can identify barriers that are preventing us from moving employees and people that we have identified that should no longer be working as va and make sure that we can do that expeditiously and thats an important part of one of our priorities in accomplishing the mission that we have to take care of our countries veteransbe glad to take any questions on that issue donovan slack from usa todayq  i just want to thank you secretary shulkin ive always wanted to do that laughterq  how does this office differ from the office of accountability reviewsecretary shulkin the office of accountability review is an office that was set up after our  issue that deals with our senior executives so that weve taken those decision away from the field so that the central office  our senior executives can have a special office that reviews their performance and makes recommendations to the department this is a broader office that will be taking a look at all of our employeesq  so going all the way downsecretary shulkin going all the way down making sure that we identify systemic barriers that prevent us from making the right decisions and also make sure that were honoring the communities that we have to our whistleblowers who have come forth and identified issues so that theres not retaliation against themq  and then last one how does this jive with the white house hotline for va complaints and then the other task force to investigate fraud and abusesecretary shulkin okay so these are all three efforts that are important for us to identify issues that are preventing us from doing the very best job that we can so were keeping our employees and our executives accountable to the values to be able to work at the va we are soliciting input from veterans who feel that they have issues that they want to share with us and thats what the hotline will be doing and we are announcing tomorrow a task force for fraud waste and abuse to make sure that we are aggressively investigating any issues that might lead to the waste of taxpayer dollarsyes sirq  secretary the va obviously has had problems with protecting whistleblowers in the past and this sounds like potentially a lot of internal investigations that could be going on to ferret out who said what about whom who did what have you thought about how much  this office  to operate is going to cost how many staff it will havesecretary shulkin there will be an additional cost to this this is an important responsibility that we have to make sure that we protect those employees who come forth and tell us about issues and we dont want retaliationpart of the presidents executive order is requiring us to take a look at what resources we already currently have dedicated to these types of activities and make sure that were not duplicating our resources and making sure that when we implement an office like this that its done in the most efficient way but this is an important responsibility our employees have to feel safe when they see something to tell us about itq  are you talking about a ballpark figure yet for how much this office will cost to runsecretary shulkin i dont have the exact figure for that but these are  at a department the size that we have these are not small amounts this is going to be a substantial commitmentq  can you talk about staffing for the office are you going to have to draw staff for this office from existing va employees or will you hire specifically for this office and if you are drawing staff from people who currently work at va is that a concerns given shortages at the departmentsecretary shulkin well one of the things that were doing right now is we are looking at our current structure in our corporate setting we think that the staffing has gotten too large at our corporate offices and we want to make sure that our resources are out into the field where we can be helping with direct service to veterans so as we look through our modernization efforts were looking to take the current staff and move them into new organizations like this so i am not anticipating that were looking at adding new staff but were looking at using our current staff in a more efficient wayq  so as you mentioned so the house has passed a bill that would really clear the path for you to be able to terminate people who have been accused of misconduct so what  im not clear where the responsibilities of the staff of this new office fall and do you need congress  i mean why have congress passed a bill if you have this office and what is  what cant you  you the va  manage the va now to fire someone who has been incompetent or whatever that this office gives you the power to dosecretary shulkin well i think that what youre seeing now is the presidents commitment to making sure that we stay on track with this and that were moving aggressively and so hes asking through his executive order for the va to do everything that it can internally but we know that thats not going to be enough to get done what i want to get done which is to be able to once we identify people that need to leave the organization to get them out quicklyso i do need legislative help as well so the house has passed a bill the senate is working on one we need them to come to agreement to be able to give the president a bill to sign it will be that combination of a legislative solution with an office in the va that we will stand up because of the executive order but i think what is necessary to make sure that we are moving people out of the va when it is identified to be appropriate to take that actionq  okay but in the absence of legislation what powers do you have now by standing up this office that you dont have right now if theres employee who has  watch porn or you know done whatever  wasted money stolen money whateversecretary shulkin i think what this is doing is its elevating the office directly under me so that this is a direct report to the secretary so its taking accountability up to the highest levelsecondly its asking us to do the internal review to make sure that our current efforts arent duplicative that they are the most efficient possible and if do identify that there are resources requirements needed that we address those and that we make sure that theres an immediate focus on on this issue q  how you are going to convince the whistleblowers that they are safe you know how things work in the government offices how are you going to assure them that if they come forward they are covered secretary shulkin well once again this office is going to have a direct report to me and we will be in investigating any issues related to retaliation and the message is clear that we will not tolerate whistleblower retaliation in the department of veteran affairs and we will take actions if we do determine that retaliation has been imposed upon an employee who has come forth with an issueq  the oar did it not report to the secretary beforesecretary shulkin no it reports through our office of legal counselq  and will that office still existsecretary shulkin yes it willq  this office is on top of thatsecretary shulkin yes and one of the issues that the president has asked us to do in the executive order is take a look at areas that are duplications so if there is overlap we will look at that and potentially address that but right now this oar office office of accountability and review is focused on our senior executivesq  just a quick one from the personnel  a friend of mine who was in maine and was in japan came back and most of the time he complains that he goes to the va hospital that even at  the problem is at the reception the receptionist is talking on the phone or he has given his address change twice it didnt change so what are you going to do about those frontline  they first meet them and they are really disappointedsecretary shulkin right well this is different than an accountability action what youre talking about is poor customer service and poor focus and attention and poor training and so what we are doing is focusing on creating a culture where that doesnt exist i cant tell you today that with  employees that people dont on occasion experience that what were working hard to do is to make sure that everybody who works in the va understands that their mission is to serve and to serve our veterans and when we find behaviors like that we had to address them from a management perspective not necessarily an accountability perspectiveq  two quick questions for you one will this office address the time that its often taken the ig to do investigations on personnel when an issue does come up i believe thats been a challenge for you all in the pastand then two how does this office differ from the central whistleblower office that i think you all were supposed  or are standing up with the neaasecretary shulkin so in regards to ig investigations no this will not address that the ig is an independent body and this will not be addressed in that but ive already said that we will not be waiting for the ig to finish their investigations if we have enough evidence to be able to take an action on accountability and on the status of employmenton the whistleblower office yes these are similar we have been asked through a piece of legislation to stand up a whistleblower office and that will be part of this office we will not duplicate thatq  can you give us an update on the washington dc medical centersecretary shulkin yes the washington dc medical center as people may know experienced a problem with their inventory control system the ig issued an interim report that i found concerning enough that i made a change in managementwe have put in a new acting director that was handselected by me who has been there day and night the inventory control system which was not in place was put in place and has been in place since  hours after we discovered the issue patient safety is not at all compromised there has not been any patient harm that we are aware of of this and we are continuing our investigation as to the actions that will result from the management perspectiveq  can i ask one more thing you said i think said recently publicly there was some  an employee accused of watching pornography or something like thatsecretary shulkin yesq  and you said something to the effect of well i cant fire that person or its difficult for mesecretary shulkin yesq  so what is this new antidote going to do to enhance your ability to move forward with something like thatsecretary shulkin that was a situation where we found a physician that had been watching pornography in the setting with a patient because that was raised to my attention i made the decision personally to propose the removal of that employee and that was done immediatelythis is the type of action that this office is going to allow when there is outrageous behavior thats not acceptable to us it is going to raise it to the visibility of this office that will report directly to me so that we can make sure those decisions are made quickly and decisivelyq  but will appeal rights for civil servants be changed you cant do that without legislation right secretary shulkin yes this will not change the process and if there is any change to the process to the due process that would need to be done legislativelyq  thank yousecretary shulkin thank you very much everybodyend pm edt

and the first lady to welcome you all to the white house this is a distinguished group of american leaders governors and members of congress and members of our cabinet and were grateful to have you all hereyou know for nearly  days president trump has been delivering on the promises that he made to the american people the president has been fighting for american jobs every single day since he was elected putting renewed emphasis on american energy cutting through a mountain range of red tape from the last administration and today the administration outlined the presidents vision for tax reform which will include one of the largest tax cuts for individuals and businesses in the history of this country applausethanks to the president trumps leadership more than  jobs have been created in  alone businesses and consumers are more confident than they have been in years and by some measure for decades it is truly extraordinaryin a word president trump has simply been in the promisekeeping business since inauguration day he signed  bills into law the most of any president since  and hell have signed some  executive orders in his first  days including the action todayand today the president is actually delivering on one more of his promises to the american people since day one president trump has been working tirelessly to uphold the constitution and restore the proper balance between the states and the federal government and thats been especially true with the presidents focus on education now as a former governor myself ive always believed as the president does that education is a state and local function and that decisions in education are best made by parents and teachers and local administrators the decisions over our childrens school should be made by parents and local administrators not by politicians or unelected bureaucrats in a far distant capitalthe president believes the same thing and the efforts that he will take today through this executive order will continue that process of empowering our families empowering our states to ensure that every child in america has access to a worldclass educationand so with a grateful heart i say on behalf of the th president of the united states and on behalf of all those gathered here today it is my high honor and distinct privilege to introduce to you the president of the united states president donald trump applausethe president well thank you very much vice president pence who has done an absolutely outstanding job as vice president we very much appreciate it and i want to thank

governor sandoval of nevada governor herbert of utah governor mead of wyoming  we want to thank you all and everyone else for being with us its really an honor to have you in white housefor too long the federal government has imposed its will on state and local governments the result has been education that spends more and achieves far far far less my administration has been working to reverse this federal power grab and give power back to families cities states give power back to localitiesbefore this administration only one time in our nations history had a president signed a bill that used the congressional review act to cancel a federal regulation in less than  days i have signed  bills such congressional resolutions to cancel federal regulations and give power back to the people and im very honored to have done so applause thats true as you said five have come from your committee thats exactly right good job i think shes done a good job applauseive also signed over a dozen executive actions that reverse federal intrusion and empower local communities the executive order im signing today is another critical step to restoring local control which is so important this executive order directs secretary devos to review current federal regulations and ensure that they dont obstruct the ability of states local governments teachers and most importantly parents to make the best decisions for their students and in many cases for their childrenprevious administrations have wrongfully forced states and schools to comply with federal whims and dictate what our kids are taught but we know that local communities do it best and know it best the time has come to empower parents and teachers to make the decisions that help their students achieve success thats what this executive order is all about so importantthomas jefferson put it best when he said i believe the states can best govern our home concerns with this executive order and the many actions we have taken in less than  days we are providing our states and communities with control over the matters that are most important to them together we are going to fight to give our children the bright and beautiful future they deserve applauseso i want to thank you all as you know im heading over to a senate meeting its a very important meeting so ill be leaving now but i just wanted to introduce our really exceptional education secretary shes caught on  you wouldnt believe it all of the great things im hearing about you betsy im very proud so secretary betsy devos thank you very much thank you applauseq  mr president would you want to see a healthcare vote by the end of this week would you like to see that sirthe president alwayssecretary devos so it has been all of our experience that those closest to the problem are best equipped to solve it that means empowering parents teachers state and local leaders  not the federal government time and time again weve seen that onesizefitsall policies and mandates from washington simply dont work we cant have a cookiecutter approach to education each state and each school have different challenges and each individual student has unique needs our solutions should be as varied as the students we serve the every student succeeds act was a good step in this direction giving flexibility to states to best meet the needs of their communities were going to implement this law as congress intended not how the previous administration dictated when we give decisionmaking power back to states and communities students benefit this

2017-04-26,Background Briefing on the First 100 Days ,james s brady press briefing room pm edtaide im here to introduce a senior administration official well known to you all im sure this is off the record and off camera and he will remain a senior administration official i know thats disappointing but thats the way it isq  on backgroundaide background sorrysenior administration official all right good to see you so what im here to talk about is really the actions of the national security team here and the events and initiatives and efforts to advance and protect us interests in the area of national security over the first  days of the trump presidency i do believe this has been a period of time in which the national security team has worked extremely well together to provide options for the president to deal with some of our most vexing difficult issues problems and also in an effort to take advantage of opportunities to advance and protect us interests as you know there have been a number of events in the world that demanded a us response those include the syrian regimes use of chemical weapons against its own people and a pattern of murderous activity on the part of that regime with many of those actions involving weapons of mass destruction chemical weaponsand then also weve been engaged in efforts to establish and maintain strong relationships with key allies and partners and to forge some new relationships that will allow us to identify areas of cooperation i think that that characterizes the summit with president xi of china and of course as youve all been reporting on we have the problem set of north korea and north koreas development of nuclear weapons and a ballistic missile program that poses a grave threat to our partners and everyone in the region but also represents a potential threat to the us homeland theres no shortage of things of course to talk about in terms of the ongoing campaign against isis  a campaign that has been centered really in iraq and in syria but as you know reaches far beyond that into other regions and into afghanistan the afghanistanpakistan border region for example and then into north africa the maghreb and so forthso i could try to summarize these but i think what id really like to do is hear whats on your minds what questions you have what youd like me to discussq  i was wondering if putting north korea back on the state sponsor of terrorism list one of the major priorities that this administration is pushing for especially with the meeting of senators now and what are some other options that you put on the tablesenior administration official that is one of the things were considering were looking at a broad range of options obviously across all elements of national power and multinational power in connection with north korea and so what the president has done is hes made a decision for us to pursue a certain course and that course obviously has a number of options associated with it depending on how the situation develops in the future so i think that what youve seen is really an integrated effort to prioritize diplomatic and informational aspects of national power but also what youll see soon is using the economic dimension of national power as well as the military preparations that are underwayq  do you have a timelinesenior administration official well we have timelines in mind for what we would like to see changed but its mainly eventdriven it depends on the actions of north korea it depends on the actions of others whose help were looking for in resolving this problem and moving toward the goal of denuclearization of the korean peninsulaill go to the far back the gentleman with the mustache thereq  thank you all you recently visited india afghanistan and pakistan we havent heard from you what your meetings were especially with the indians when is the afghanistan review coming outsenior administration official well were in the midst of a policy review so i dont really want to foreclose on any of the discussions were going to have with the national security team and with the president what weve been able to do though is take a fresh look at a problem that weve been engaged with for  years and identify really how that  and understand better how that conflict has evolved in afghanistan and evolved in pakistan as welland what were determined to do is to take a regional perspective a regional look at the problem and to make sure that were integrating again all of our efforts and what we found is that often whats been consistent i think in recent years is that weve often done just enough in afghanistan to avoid failure but maybe not done enough and when i say enough i dont mean scale of effort as much of integration of our efforts to succeedand i think the other critical thing that weve looked at is that our approach to regional aspects of the problem has to change because weve taken a consistent approach for example to the regional dimensions of the problem and havent really seen improvements in assistance from others and efforts to address the problem in afghanistan more effectivelyso what weve done is really looked at opportunities to better connect what were doing militarily in afghanistan which as you know involves a very significant counterterrorism effort that was highlighted by recent operations against isis khorasan in the far eastern part of the country in nangarhar province very effective operations that have resulted in the destruction of a large percentage of that enemy force and an enemy that is an isis enemy but weve identified really overlap with tehrikitaliban pakistan groups as well as lashkaretaiba and other groups there so its a counterterrorism effort certainly but the other aspect the military effort is to advise and assist the afghan security forces and you saw the very serious attacks against those forces this past week which highlights the need for us to work with the afghan government to strengthen those security forces which you know have been fighting and making tremendous sacrifices to defend their nation and their people against the taliban the haqqani network as well as these transnational terrorist organizations that were seeking the safe haven and support base in afghanistanbut oftentimes what hasnt happened is a connection  very strong connection between that military effort and political efforts and diplomatic efforts and so forth and so thats what were endeavoring to do with this review is to create options that produce a better integrated effort and a more effective effortq  can you tell us a little bit about what the briefing with the senators is all aboutsenior administration official what we wanted to highlight obviously  and of course the senate asked for a hearing essentially and the president offered to host it here at the white house  to communicate the seriousness of the threat from north korea and to allow the senators to ask questions of the national security team and understand better the nature of the threat but also what our response to that threat has been and how were proceeding to protect the american people and our partners in the region from this very grave threat represented by what we know is a brutal regime what we know is an unpredictable regime what we know is a capable regime in terms of conventional military capabilities and a regime that holds at risk a large portion of the population of south koreabut now really a new level of threat from north korea associated with the unacceptable and erratic and unlawful behavior of the kim regime  kim jonguns regime  are represented by the murder of his brother using a nerve agent in a public place in an airport but also the increasing capability for destruction that that regime possesses in the form of a nuclear program and the ballistic missile program so its about the seriousness and its about a discussion of a strategy and approach thats developed a broad range of options to remove this threat not only to the american people but to our allies and partners in the regionq  sorry i just had a followup on thatsenior administration official ill just go to kimq  i would like to ask are they getting a list of options but also what do you assess is the risk of a miscalculation by north korea if there is a us preemptive strike of some sort do you assume that they will launch some sort of an attack on south korea or japansenior administration official well what weve done is taken a very systematic look at this and obviously everything begins with our intelligence community and their assessments but then even as we take certain actions as we put into place elements of these integrated  of this integrated strategy we ask the intelligence community to help us anticipate reactions to our actions and then if theres risk associated with that we build into the strategy efforts to mitigate riskobviously nothing is riskfree and certainly this situation is not riskfree but the team has done everything that we can to try to anticipate reactions and then mitigate any risk associated with thoseq  what is the state of play with north korea are they  do they seem to be on the brink of another nuclear test or are they about to test another ballistic missile senior administration official well what we have seen in recent weeks are indications that they were preparing these kind of activities weve seen a pattern of activities right over recent years and what we saw instead was a conventional firepower demonstrated associated with army day on the th but were remaining vigilant to identify any indicators of another nuclear test or of a ballistic missile test or certainly an intercontinental ballistic missile test and are prepared to respond to any of those provocationslets go in the far back with the  the plaid shirtq  thank you senior administration official actually it was the man behind you but ill take the plaid tie followed by the plaid shirt how about thatq  thank you did i hear you correctly at the top saying that the north korean strategy is evolving where there will be  soon there will be an economic dimension as well as military preparations thats obviously going to get a lot of attention can you flesh that out a little bit for us what kinds of preparations are we talking about are they going to be visible to the north koreanssenior administration official yes so of course some of the economic actions take time to develop and what were endeavoring to do is to work with partners in the region and others to isolate the north korean ballistic missile program and the nuclear program from any sort of external supportif you just look at the images right of the big parade there recently and look at the complexity of that equipment those components even the tires right are not made in north korea so its clear that all of us have a lot more to do to isolate the regime from its access to the kind of materials and technologies and components it needs to advance those two very dangerous programsq  the military preparations that you mentioned sir the military preparationssenior administration official well those  i dont think were going to describe those in any detailq  thank you weve seen a broader view of the presidents foreign policy last night chief of staff reince priebus offered us a first draft of what he would define the trump doctrine as i was hoping you might be able to put a finer point on what you believe now  here in the  days  what is the trump doctrinesenior administration official well what i would say a couple of observations you could make  whether its actually a component of the trump doctrine or not thats up to the president and were working on that dr nadia schadlow is here shes working on the national security strategy working with the presidents team and the president to get his guidance and to formulate that national security strategy  the congressionally mandated national security strategybut i think what youve seen is that the president obviously weighs the risk of any action that hes anticipating but what hes also done in these first few weeks is weigh the risk of inaction and whereas considering the risk only of action could have the tendency to paralyze a leader i think what hes done is hes recognized that there is a cost associated with inaction and i think the obvious example of this is the response to the mass murder of civilians with chemical weapons in syriaand so the actions that hes taken though i would say  and this is another element of how weve seen the president lead is that he doesnt just look at a discreet event and react to that event he tries to use that event and the us response to it to make progress toward objectives that are related to the security and prosperity of the american peoplethe other thing i would say an element of the trump doctrine is its not doctrinaire at all laughter its very pragmatic its based on the presidents consultation with his advisers and his national security team for whom he has a great deal of trust so i think that theres some sort of toplevel observations you can make about what is the trump doctrine but there will be more about that in the coming monthsgentleman right hereq  thank you very much moving back to isis again early on during the campaign the president said over and over again that one of his hopes was to get along with russia and to work with russia to defeat isis obviously the situation is not the same as it was during the campaign between the two countries but what if any efforts can we expect to reach out to the russian government and try to work together on this one issue where our interests most definitely alignsenior administration official well i think secretary tillerson has been really clear about this that while we are going to confront what we regard as russian inappropriate and regretful and support for the assad regime for example that well continue to look for ways to cooperate with russiawhile we will not back off from our support for our european allies and for partners in southern and central europe that have been subjected to a sophisticated campaign of subversion and disinformation or were not going to back away from our nato allies and their efforts to stand up to a very sophisticated russian approach to try to undermine the alliance what we are looking for are areas and opportunities and places to cooperate with russiaand there are areas where our interests overlap you mentioned one of those which is the defeat of isis and the denial of isis control of territory and populations in syria for examplebut we have to also recognize that its russias support for the assad regime along with their iranian allies that helps perpetuate the cycle of sectarian violence there and the chaotic environment that perpetuates human suffering and obstructs really a sustainable end to the civil war thereso the simple answer to your question is while we will compete with russia where we think that our interests are at odds with them we are looking for areas that we can cooperateq  and those areas what kind of outreach has there beensenior administration official well you saw secretary tillersons visit to russia and then there will be follow up from that and hes the best person to ask about that he certainly has the leadyesq  can i just follow in the conversation about the dprk obviously there has been a lot of discussion by president trump about his relationship with president xi can you talk about what you realistically believe that beijing can accomplish given the fact that even over the weekend weve seen a war of words between pyongyang and beijing theyre not exactly seeing eyetoeye all the time these days what is a realistic expectation and are you encouraging them to have a carrot as well as a stick with respect to economic incentives not just denialssenior administration official well what the president said is well see right and he has certainly established a very close personal relationship with president xi and there are areas as you know where our interests overlap and i think whats different about how china is viewing the problem in north korea today is that china is viewing that problem as a threat not only to us interests and security or south korea andor japanese interests and security but also a threat to chinese interests and security and so i think that is a big shift in and of itselfthe second thing is the willingness to support  or at least not block the united nations and international communitys sanction of syria for the use of weapons of mass destruction i think that indicated another area that we can work togetheryou have seen some early indications of china doing a better job enforcing existing un sanctions on north korea as well as i think you see in the chinese press and in other areas really a clear effort to communicate to north korea that its behavior its provocative behavior the nuclear test missile tests the existence of these programs cant be toleratedand so i think youve seen two things  and acknowledgement of the threat to china but i think youve also seen a willingness for china to take this problem on in new ways and i think we ought to suspend judgment until we see how this develops in the coming days months so forthall right thanks i will just say one last thing just in conclusion and ill just say that i think it is  youve seen that the team has really come together well around these complex issues and if you think about the pace of events and the degree of concurrent activity that we have going on you can i think recognize that we are achieving a degree of strategic competence here by being able to view events and whats happening daytoday in context with what were trying to achieve overalland one of the things that the president has asked us to do is to get the white house out of tactical details daytoday he trusts his national security team to implement and so what you have now is a focus on the part of the national security council on identifying what are the biggest problems and dangers and threats to our national security but also what are the biggest opportunitiesand now what were doing is organizing our efforts around framing some of these problems and opportunities viewing them through the lens of us vital interests and primarily obviously the security of the american people and then establishing clear objectives and then working together at a very senior level to identify how we can integrate efforts across the elements of national power diplomatically informationally militarily economically law enforcement intelligence and so forth to advance towards those objectives and of course none of these problems and opportunities are going to be easy to either capitalize on or to solve but the team i think has the right focus has come together and i think we have really the ability now to not just respond to events but to understand how events fit in to what wed like to achieve at a larger level of generality so thank youend pm edt ,20975.089844,6.240234000000783,0.00029750690206391766,6025.22998,23.70996099999957,0.003935113029494613,2387.449951,1.3200689999998758,0.0005529200725011872

2017-04-26,On-the-Record Press Call on the Education Federalism Executive Order ,via telephone am edthi this is rob goad im a senior department of education official im just going to read a brief statement about the presidents executive order and then ill take a few questionsso today the president is signing an executive order that delivers on his commitment to ensure education decisions are made by those closest to students since our founding education was intended to be under state and local control in recent years however too many in washington have advanced topdown mandates that take away autonomy and limit the options available to educators administrators and parentstodays executive order puts an end to this overreach ensuring that states and localities are free to make educational decisions as required by law this executive order makes certain that local leaders will be making the decisions about what happens in the classroom parents will no longer have to worry about the federal government enacting overreaching mandates or requiring states to adopt a federal curriculum at the expense of local education innovationthis eo takes the next needed step toward identifying and eliminating dcdriven regulations that attempt to control what students are or arent taught over the next  days this executive order directs secretary devos to review and if necessary modify and repeal regulations and guidance issued by the department of education with a clear mandate to identify places where dc has overstepped its legal authoritythe departments regulatory review task force will manage this process among other critical regulatory issues and work with the public to help determine which regulations are inconsistent with federal law onesizefitsall policies never work especially for individual students with individual and unique needs supporting local control means supporting education better tailored to the students the school serves states should have the freedom and flexibility to advance creative and innovative ideas to determine the best ways to provide the highestquality education possible to every studentwith this executive order president trump has reaffirmed his commitment to getting the federal government out of the way and to returning control over education back where it belongs at the state and local levelwhen communities and parents make the educational choices students win todays executive order puts us firmly on that trackwith that ill take a few questions regarding the executive orderq  hi this is allison at education week can you remind me exactly how this executive order would i guess change anything because obviously the inaudible already included a lot of prohibitions on the secretarys role can you walk me through how this is different from inaudiblemr goad sure yeah well i think this executive order goes a step beyond inaudible by having a comprehensive review of all of the guidance and regulations issued by the previous administration and then identifying anything that may or may not be consistent with federal law q  and how long did you say the secretary will have to do thismr goad threehundred daysq  threehundred days and will there be a public report issued at the end or how will the findings be made publicmr goad they will go to the white house and then i believe there will be a public report q  im wondering if this is focused just on k or if this will go into sort of the prek and highered spaces as wellmr goad its just focused on kq  im sorry i couldnt hear your answer to the question about the process can you go through that againmr goad in regards to the process for q  the report mr goad so theres going to be a regulatory review task force that will be reviewing the regulations and guidance issued by the previous administration to confirm if theyre consistent or inconsistent with federal law and then there will be a report at the end of  days q  and on that regulatory review task force will those be ed department employees or who will be on that task forcemr goad yes its the same task force that is doing the regulatory review at the department of education which i believe was announced yesterday bob eitel will be leading that effortq  im sorry can you say the name again whos leading the effortmr goad bob eitelq  you said at the top that this executive order would empower the secretary to modify or get rid of any regulations that dont comply with law how will that process workmr goad so i think at the end of  days and after we have produced a report we will make those decisions once the report has concludedq  so is she empowered to modify the regulations as needed or is that going to be a separate process entirelymr goad the executive order gives her  empowers her to modify anything that is inconsistent with federal lawq  isnt she already empowered to do those things this executive order doesnt give her those powers rightmr goad thats right i got time for one moreokay thats it guys thanks so muchend am edt

2017-04-25,Statement on Sanctuary Cities Ruling ,today the rule of law suffered another blow as an unelected judge unilaterally rewrote immigration policy for our nation federal law explicitly states that a federal state or local government entity or official may not prohibit or in any way restrict any government entity or official from sending to or receiving from the immigration and naturalization service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status lawful or unlawful of any individual  usc a that means according to congress a city that prohibits its officials from providing information to federal immigration authorities  a sanctuary city  is violating the law sanctuary cities like san francisco block their jails from turning over criminal aliens to federal authorities for deportation these cities are engaged in the dangerous and unlawful nullification of federal law in an attempt to erase our bordersonce again a single district judge  this time in san francisco  has ignored federal immigration law to set a new immigration policy for the entire country this decision occurred in the same sanctuary city that released the time deported illegal immigrant who gunned down innocent kate steinle in her fathers arms san francisco and cities like it are putting the wellbeing of criminal aliens before the safety of our citizens and those city officials who authored these policies have the blood of dead americans on their hands this san francisco judges erroneous ruling is a gift to the criminal gang and cartel element in our country empowering the worst kind of human trafficking and sex trafficking and putting thousands of innocent lives at riskthis case is yet one more example of egregious overreach by a single unelected district judge todays ruling undermines faith in our legal system and raises serious questions about circuit shopping but we are confident we will ultimately prevail in the supreme court just as we will prevail in our lawful efforts to impose immigration restrictions necessary to keep terrorists out of the united statesin the meantime we will pursue all legal remedies to the sanctuary city threat that imperils our citizens and continue our efforts to ramp up enforcement to remove the criminal and gang element from our country ultimately this is a fight between sovereignty and open borders between the rule of law and lawlessness and between hardworking americans and those who would undermine their safety and freedom ,20996.119141,-21.029297000000955,-0.0010015801900712293,6025.490234000001,-0.2602539999998044,-4.319217024554626e-05,2388.610107,-1.1601559999999154,-0.00048570337896502736
2017-04-25,Press Briefing by Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke on the Executive Order to Review the Designations Under the Antiquities Act ,james s brady press briefing room pm edtms walters hello everyone as you guys knows were going to go through an eo for tomorrow the speaker this evening is secretary zinke this is embargoed until  pm it is on the record so everything discussed here will be on the record the embargo is until  pm tonightagain this falls underneath kellys issue area so if you have any additional followup questions please reach out to kelly love for those of you on the phone there will be a handout during this session so if you would like the handout please email kelly as well and we will get it to youwith that ill turn it oversecretary zinke so ill read this and then ill answer some questions tomorrow the president will come to the department of interior to my office and sign the executive order to review the antiquities act the executive order will direct me as the secretary to review prior monument designations and to suggest legislative changes or modifications to the monuments the monument designation period stretches from  january  under which the act  and it has to include acts and monuments that are  acres or more  so the beginning date is january st  and the other condition is they have to be a total of  acres or more that should include about  to  monuments that gives you kind of a thumbnail the executive order directs the interior to provide an interim report to the president within  days of the day of the order and a final report to the president within  days of that order for the record in the last  years in particular that would cover about oh tens of millions of acres to include marine area sanctuaries some of these areas were put off limits for traditional uses like farming ranching timber harvest mining oil and gas exploration fishing and motorized recreation the designations on kind of the bookends are the grand staircaseescalante national monument of  and that was the first blm land designation all the way to really the bears ears national monument in  which has been in the news a lot so those are the kind of two bookends again its monuments that are  acres or larger so it hits the big onesthe presidents  the authority on such matters is singular so you know theres no requirement for public input before the designation of a monument and theres no nepa requirement normally when you do a land use project we normally nepa the antiquities act is the exception again we dont have to go through legislative process the president determines it and it does not have to go through nepain this case the administration as you all know has heard from members of congress and states and in some cases the designation of the monuments may have resulted in loss of jobs reduced wages and reduced public access and in the case of sign public land use we feel that the public the people that the monuments affect should be considered and thats why the president is asking for a review of the monuments designated in the last  years to see what changes if any improvements can be made and give states and local communities a meaningful voice in the processand i can tell you from a kid who grew up in montana or grew up in the west where muchneeded monuments have taken place i think todays executive order and review of the antiquities act over the past two decades is long overdue and the policy is consistent with the presidents promise to give americans a voice and make sure their voices are heard like many of the actions hes taken since assuming the role of the president the office this is yet another example the president is doing exactly what he was saying in his campaign promises and hes deliveringthe president believes like i do that many of the neighbors in the western states of the federal government can be a good neighbor we can protect areas of cultural and economic importance and they can use the federal lands for economic development when appropriate just as teddy roosevelt envisioned it i am a lifetime supporter and admirer of teddy roosevelts policies and the president is the samethe antiquities act of   and that was under president roosevelt  it did give the president the authority to declare historic monuments landmarks prehistoric structures and other objects of historic and scientific interest on federal lands also in the antiquities act authors specified the scope of the authority to designate the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected thats verbiage from the act itselfso with the average size of the monuments designations over the past years has increased i think that should be worthy of notice since the s when the act was first used the average size of the national monuments came from  acres to today in the millions of acres so heres what the executive order does in summary it restores the trust between local communities in washington that the local communities and states will have a voice  those states that are affected and local communities the executive order puts america and the department of interior back on track to manage our federal lands in accordance with traditional multiple use as laid out by pinchot and the president and directs the department of interior to make recommendations to the president on whether a monument should be rescinded resized modified in order to better manage our federal lands and this executive order gives rural communities across america again a voice as his campaign promised and is delivering thatheres what the executive order does not do the executive order does not strip any monument of a designation the executive order does not loosen any environmental or conservation regulation on any land or marine areas it is a review of the last  years and the review has timelines in which i am obligated to upholdso i have with me my advisor downey magallanes with me downey is there and shell help me answer questions if i cannot field them so questions sirq  does this executive order presuppose that the president has the authority to unilaterally withdraw weighins or revoke a national monument designation or is that one of the issues that secretary zinke no as i said in my hearing its undisputed the president has the authority to modify a monument its pretty premature to suggest we do the review in which im going to review and recommend to the president whether to rescind a monument completely or modify it it is untested as you know whether the president can do that but at this point i havent gone through the list  and im sure someone is going to ask me how im going to go through and review so ill be glad to answer thatyes sirq  thank you very much first just to clarify it was extended to  years just to include grand staircase in this review and secondly do you believe at the end of this review process youll recommend changes to the antiquities actsecretary zinke the bookends really are from the grand staircase to bears ears so thats the period of time roughly  about  yearsq  so its included on purposesecretary zinke well it went back  years so im not going to predispose what the outcome is going to be how im going to proceed is this  is im going to talk to congressional delegations and review the list im going to talk to governors im going to talk to the stakeholders involved and formulate recommendations that are appropriateup front im a teddy roosevelt guy and so i think when the antiquities act came out i think we should all recognize that by and large the antiquities act and the monuments that we have protected have done a great service to the public and are some of our most treasured lands in this country so this is an enormous responsibility i have to make recommendations that are appropriate that follow the law but no one loves our public lands more than i you could love them as much but you cant love them more than i do and thats one of the reasons why i love my jobq  during your confirmation hearing you told maria cantwell i am absolutely against the transfer and sale of public lands it cant be more clear do you still believe that and i have a followupsecretary zinke absolutely unequivocally i stand by  matter of fact with a recreational guide this morning i made the same statement again is that i am opposed to transfer or sale of public landwhat i am strongly supportive of is managing our land and theres no doubt if you  especially out west you look at the catastrophic forest fires our wildlife corridors our water management  that we can do a lot better as a government of managing our land and to a degree weve drifted too far away from multiple use into single useq  do you worry though that this will lead to the transfer of landsecretary zinke no ive heard that argument i think that argument is falseq  it just wont happensecretary zinke and remember the monuments before this happened were public land and when they designate a monument what it does is it restricts it and sometimes it restricts it from traditional uses like grazing public access in some cases can be restricted because gates go upso i think you have to proceed carefully on it but multiple use on much of our land was designed under pinchot to use for the public good for all of us and not necessarily single use and thats where we areq  you said in your last response that in general you feel like in most of these cases the designations have provided some kind of public service and theyve done a good job can you talk about the flip side of that coin  cases where you feel like maybe they actually havent and then just one clarification  does this apply to monuments that were designated earlier than  but then modified after  apparently there are a number that fall into that categorysecretary zinke on your second point if the modification was significant well look at that my understanding is theres about  or so monuments that fall into the category of  acres or larger and the modification was significant but by and large its the bookends we talked abouti think the concern that i have and the president has that when you designate a monument the local community thats affected should have a voice and he said that in the campaign he said that american citizens should have a voice the little community the loggers the fishermen those areas that are affected should have a say and a voiceand so again this executive order doesnt predispose any action other than having the secretary that he chose  me review them and im going to review it in a transparent matter to make sure a we have a voice the process is transparent and at the end of it were going to follow the law as teddy roosevelt laid outq  just want to get back to concern swirling around the eo whats your response to people who believe that the review is setting the stage for an assault on public lands for the purposes of oil and gas developmentsecretary zinke ive heard that many times about  and i think its the modern media that we live in today were so polarized as a country and action is perceived as doing something thats not  and this the executive order is carefully crafted to review it doesnt predispose an outcome again the president  i was honored to be chosen and confirmed as his secretary of interior ive laid out my beliefs as well as the president shares about public land but again the core of this is to make sure the public has a voice thats who i work for thats who the president works for is the people and thats  love to get the people a voice on that but i think its a false narrative that were going to predispose any particular action until the reviewq  are you anticipating any legal challenges from environmental groups and what are you doing to prepare for some pretty staunch opposition from some of these groups opposed to the presidents secretary zinke its interesting in the first days of my office i think i got sued six times before lunch so prudent public policy should be the right policy and im not in fear of getting sued i get sued all the time i dont think lawsuits should shape public policy i think our public policy should do whats right the courts are free to challenge and we live in a great country that people are free to challenge im not going to make my judgments on the basis of getting sued or not sued doing the right thing q  mr secretary you referred to lost jobs could you provide a concrete example going back to  of where theres community that  in terms of net job loss it exceeded the gains from being designated a national monument and in terms of your recommendations obviously you and white house officials have indicated that it might include legislative recommendations to what extent do you think congress is the one that should redraw the lines based on community input as opposed to say the white house and the interior department redrawing any lines for these monumentssecretary zinke great question jobs thats part of the study were going to look at because you have on the side  some jobs would probably be created by recreation opportunities so in the parks we had  million visitors last year some of our parks alone are at record capacity and so i was this morning in our parks and i think our economic driver is at  billion a year and if you look at the recreation industry its quite a bit more than thatso theres jobs across  well look at what sectors were affected plus or minus and that will be part of the recommendation i cant give you any numbers until we look at it but jobs  i recognize on both sides secondly im sorry your second point wasq  my second question is to what extent should it be congress that actually redraws the lines for any of these monuments or to what extent do you think that the white house and the interior department can unilaterally redraw themsecretary zinke from an antiquities act point  this is  the president has singular authority but i think the philosophy on public lands should be whats inscribed in the roosevelt arch yellowstone park  its for the benefit and enjoyment of the people thats whats ascribed in stone at the yellowstone arch and oddly enough in one of the pillars it says enacted by congressso i think its appropriate the three branches of government  at least the congress and the president  should work together certainly in utah you have a congressional delegation  this is the two weve talked about in utah i think that the delegation that represents the people should be coordinated with the governor should be coordinated  and the principals on the ground on both sides their voice needs to be heardq  yes thank you is it your opinion that inaudible will be used in the antiquities actsecretary zinke well certainly thats a concern if youre out in utah the utah legislature  on a state side theyre vehemently opposed to it those out in the west would probably say its abused my position is im going into it and evaluating on a legal basis and making sure people have a say but im not going in with a political judgment either way i just want to make a firm judgment based on the facts on the ground and giving people a voice certainly the governor is going to have an influence jobs are going to have an influence the congressional folks are going to have an influence on it but given my personality im going to be transparent about itand sir im going to give you the last questionq  thank you so you said theres going to be a day interim review weve seen the president sign other executive orders where he just asks for a final review is there a particular reason why theres a shorter window for that secretary zinke the day review is pretty much centered on bears ears because thats the most current one my obligation is to wrap up at least my recommendation in  days the recommendation i could save for further review so thats part of it is i have some latitude as the secretary to look at whether i have the facts on the ground again a lot of its going to be driven on talking to elected officials local governments the stakeholders and making a reasonable decision so we the people have a voice and i think its appropriate to  a couple mentions whether the president  this president has some plan to sell or transfer public lands  no this executive order simply i think initiates a review which is appropriate when an administration comes in  a new administration that was one of his campaign promises hes delivering on a promise he selected me to review it i may be the most popular individual in the world or i may be the most unpopular position in the world but its a job that  i cant be more thrilled being the secretary of interior i mean to be the steward of a fifth of our country and the majesty  its an enormous responsibility but also its a gift so im going to use that authority i think to the benefit of us all so thank you everybodyq  just to clear up do you expect to have a decision on bears ears in  dayssecretary zinke i expect to have a recommendationq  a recommendation on bears ears in  dayssecretary zinke i doq  and are you planning on going in that amount of timesecretary zinke i am going to be out there theres no doubt im going out there and i would have been sooner but we had the first cabinet meeting i was delayed in the hearings so no doubt that my travel schedule is going to be busier than it already isq  mr secretary just on inaudible  can you just say anything about your philosophy about that upcoming executive order which we also expect this yearms walters well be able to comment on that on thursday were going to put together a background briefing thank yousecretary zinke keep the faith its all goodq  thank you mr secretary q  thank you  end pm edt

very busy day  had a good day were doing well very well things are turning around i know theyre turning around for you folks so i just want to welcome you very much to the white house  special place  americas farmers and ranchers i especially want to congratulate secretary  now i can say secretary sonny perdue who was just sworn in as the secretary of agriculture  applause  sworn in by justice

the way across the great plains and put down roots from coast to coast today americas farmers feed not only our nation but millions of people around the world and were going to open that up much more for you folks because as you know its not totally open to put it mildly we learned that yesterday frankly with canada where the dairy farmers up in wisconsin upstate new york different places  a lot of border states in particular  are not able to sell their dairy products into canada and this has been going on for a while and were not going to put up with itand separately we put a very big tax  we will be putting a very big tariff on lumber  timber  coming into this country people dont realize canada has been very rough on the united states everyone thinks of canada as being wonderful and so do i i love canada but theyve outsmarted our politicians for many years and you people understand that so we did institute a very big tariff we announced it yesterday and were going to take care of our dairy farmers in wisconsin and upstate new york and lots of other places so i think you people all probably agree with that right would you agree with that you better believe itour farmers deserve a government that serves their interest and empowers them to do the hard work that they love to do so much and thats what todays executive order is all about with this order im directing secretary perdue to work with other members of my cabinet to identify and eliminate unnecessary regulations that hurt our nations farmers and rural communities now sonny ive already signed a lot of regulations and terminations that really help the farmer a lot you know what im talking about but we have some left and youll identify them but weve really gotten rid of some of the biggest ones and that was a big help right i mean they wont tell you about it but theyre big numbers and its going to mean a lot to the farmersthis order also establishes the interagency task force on agriculture and rural prosperity to be led by secretary perdue i just want to tell you that its an honor to be with you because among many other things with this order we continue a very relentless effort to make life better for hardworking americans and that includes the farmers and all of the people gathered around this table including our ranchers our rural community folks were having a very very big impact its already started sonny is going to now identify additional areas where we can get rid of unnecessary regulations and you people are going to be so prosperous and youre going to hire so many more people

world human trafficking whats going on the wall is going to get built and were setting record numbers in terms of stopping people from coming in and stopping drugs from coming in you see the numbers

2017-04-25,Remarks by President Trump at United States Holocaust Memorial Museum National Days of Remembrance  ,united states capitolwashington dc am edtthe president thank you very much thank you friends members of congress ambassadors veterans and most especially to the survivors here with us today its an honor to join you on this very very solemn occasion i am deeply moved to stand before those who survived historys darkest hour your cherished presence transforms this place into a sacred gatheringthank you tom bernstein alan holt sara bloomfield and everyone at the holocaust memorial council and museum for your vital work and tireless contributionswe are privileged to be joined by israels ambassador to the united states friend of mine  hes done a great job and said some wonderful words  ron dermer the state of israel is an eternal monument to the undying strength of the jewish people the fervent dream that burned in the hearts of the oppressed is now filled with the breath of life and the star of david waves atop a great nation arisen from the desertto those in the audience who have served america in uniform our country eternally thanks you we are proud and grateful to be joined today by veterans of the second world war who liberated survivors from the camps your sacrifice helped save freedom for the world  for the entire world applause sadly this year marks the first day of remembrance since the passing of elie wiesel a great person a great man his absence leaves an empty space in our hearts but his spirit fills this room it is the kind of gentle spirit of an angel who lived through hell and whose courage still lights the path from darkness though elies story is well known by so many people its always worth repeating he suffered the unthinkable horrors of the holocaust his mother and sister perished in auschwitz he watched his father slowly dying before his own young eyes in buchenwald he lived through an endless nightmare of murder and death and he inscribed on our collective conscience the duty we have to remember that long dark night so as never to again repeat itthe survivors in this hall through their testimony fulfill the righteous duty to never forget and engrave into the worlds memory the nazi genocide of the jewish people you witnessed evil and what you saw is beyond description beyond any description many of you lost your entire family everything and everyone you loved gone you saw mothers and children led to mass slaughter you saw the starvation and the torture you saw the organized attempt at the extermination of an entire people  and great people i must add you survived the ghettos the concentration camps and the death camps and you persevered to tell your stories you tell of these living nightmares because despite your great pain you believe in elies famous plea that for the dead and the living we must bear witness that is why we are here today  to remember and to bear witness to make sure that humanity never ever forgetsthe nazis massacred  million jews two out of every three jews in europe were murdered in the genocide millions more innocent people were imprisoned and executed by the nazis without mercy without even a sign of mercy yet even today there are those who want to forget the past worse still there are even those filled with such hate total hate that they want to erase the holocaust from history those who deny the holocaust are an accomplice to this horrible evil and well never be silent  we just wont  we will never ever be silent in the face of evil again applause denying the holocaust is only one of many forms of dangerous antisemitism that continues all around the world weve seen antisemitism on university campuses in the public square and in threats against jewish citizens even worse its been on display in the most sinister manner when terrorists attack jewish communities or when aggressors threaten israel with total and complete destructionthis is my pledge to you we will confront antisemitism applause we will stamp out prejudice we will condemn hatred we will bear witness and we will act as president of the united states i will always stand with the jewish people  and i will always stand with our great friend and partner the state of israelso today we remember the  million jewish men women and children whose lives and dreams were stolen from this earthwe remember the millions of other innocent victims the nazis so brutally targeted and so brutally killed we remember the survivors who bore more than we can imagine we remember the hatred and evil that sought to extinguish human life dignity and freedom but we also remember the light that shone through the darkness we remember sisters and brothers who gave everything to those they loved  survivors like steven springfield who in the long death march carried his brother on his back as he said i just couldnt give inwe remember the brave souls who banded together to save the lives of their neighbors  even at the risk of their own life and we remember those first hopeful moments of liberation when at long last the american soldiers arrived in camps and cities throughout occupied europe waving the same beautiful flags before us today speaking those three glorious words you are freeit is this love of freedom this embrace of human dignity this call to courage in the face of evil that the survivors here today have helped to write onto our hearts the jewish people have endured oppression persecution and those who have sought and planned their destruction yet through the suffering they have persevered they have thrived and they have enlightened the world we stand in awe of the unbreakable spirit of the jewish peoplei want to close with a story enshrined in the museum that captures the moment of liberation in the final days of the war it is the story of gerda klein a young jewish woman from poland some of you know her gerdas family was murdered by the nazis she spent three years imprisoned in labor camps and the last four months of the war on a terrible death march she assumed it was over at the end on the eve of her st birthday her hair had lost all of its color and she weighed a mere  pounds yet she had the will to live another day it was toughgerda later recalled the moment she realized that her longawaited deliverance had arrived she saw a car coming towards her many cars had driven up before but this one was different on its hood in place of that wretched swastika was a bright beautiful gleaming white star two american soldiers got out one walked up to her the first thing gerda said was what she had been trained to say we are jewish you know we are jewish and then he said so am i it was a beautiful moment after so much darkness after so much evilas gerda took this solider to see the other prisoners the american did something she had long forgotten to even expect  he opened the door for her in gerdas words that was the moment of restoration of humanity of humanness of dignity and of freedombut the story does not end there because as some of you know that young american soldier who liberated her and who showed her such decency would soon become her husband a year later they were married in her words he opened not only the door for me but the door to my life and to my futuregerda has since spent her life telling the world of what she witnessed she like those survivors who are among us today has dedicated her life to shining a light of hope through the dark of nightyour courage strengthens us your voices inspire us and your stories remind us that we must never ever shrink away from telling the truth about evil in our time evil is always seeking to wage war against the innocent and to destroy all that is good and beautiful about our common humanity but evil can only thrive in darkness and what you have brought us today is so much more powerful than evil you have brought us hope  hope that love will conquer hatred that right will defeat wrong and that peace will rise from the ashes of wareach survivor here today is a beacon of light and it only takes one light to illuminate even the darkest space just like it takes only one truth to crush a thousand lies and one hero to change the course of history we know that in the end good will triumph over evil and that as long as we refuse to close our eyes or to silence our voices we know that justice will ultimately prevailso today we mourn we remember we pray and we pledge never againthank you god bless you and god bless america thank you very much

about an hour and a half talking about issues from budget all the way to peacekeeping issues as well as conflicts in north korea and syria and then with the problems in iran so it was a very healthy discussion therefrom there we came over to the white house and the president greeted all of the members had his picture taken with them and then we all sat down for lunch and it was an open dialogue very much of the members wanting to hear from the president what his plans are what he was going to continue to do on syria or not continue to do  north korea all of those issues are certainly at the forefront and the idea that he would have that dialogue with them is tremendously helpful to me  whereas in the security council we need them to really engage we need them to now know that we are about action and i think that what weve tried to do in the un is really bring reform  reform in the way we spend reform in the peacekeeping operations but also reform in the resolutions that are passed that what we pass actually means something and that theres accountability in what we pass and so i think they heard that loud and clear today from the president i think that they are thrilled with the engagement that they had and i think it shows that the president is very engaged on foreign policy and they see that the idea that he would sit down and want to talk to them about each of their countries and the security council collectively is massive for a president to be able to do this and it was certainly helpful for the united states now they are in briefings with general mcmaster focusing on north korea also focusing on isis and engaging on that front and well continue to have other conversations as well but as far as we go great day for the security council great day with the president and certainly more good to come out of this meetingso thank you very much ive got some ambassadors waiting and we will talk to you soon thank youmr spicer thank you ambassador so without further ado secretary of the treasury steven mnuchinsecretary mnuchin seems like im becoming a regular here its nice to see all of you againq  we have no problem with that sirsecretary mnuchin earlier today the united states department of treasurys office of foreign asset control imposed sanctions in response to the april th  sarin attack on innocent civilians by the regime of syrian dictator assad ofac is sanctioning  employees of syrias scientific studies and research center  the syrian government agency responsible for developing and producing nonconventional weapons and means to deliver them ofac has targeted these  employees because they have expertise in chemistry and related fields or have worked in support of chemical weapons programs since at least  todays action less than three weeks after the attack on khan sheikhun is one of the largest ever executed by ofac in a single action we are more than doubling the number of individuals and entities sanctioned since the start of the syrian conflict pursuant to syriarelated executive orders these sweeping sanctions are intended to hold the assad regime and those who support it directly or indirectly accountable for their blatant violations of the chemical weapons convention and un security council resolution the united states is sending a strong message with this action that we will not tolerate the use of chemical weapons by any actor and we intend to hold the assad regime accountable for its unacceptable behavior the treasury department together with the department of state and our international partners will continue to relentlessly pursue and shut down the financial networks of any individuals involved with syrias production or use of chemical weaponsid also comment that recently we had sanctions on north korea and iran and will also continue to add to and monitor those as appropriateand with that id be happy to take a few questionsq  mr secretary is this the only round of sanctions we can expect against syria in the wake of that chemical weapons attacks or are you considering more and are you considering the possibility of sanctions against russia for not going far enough to try to dissuade assadsecretary mnuchin we dont comment on the specifics of sanctions that we are going to do in the future but again what i will tell you is these sanctions programs are very important theyre very effective and we will continue to use them to the maximum amount available by lawq  secretary on the budget is the border wall a deal breaker for the president even to the point of a government shutdownsecretary mnuchin im not going to comment on the specifics of that but i will say is i was in a meeting this morning with director mick mulvaney and other senior people the president is working hard to keep the government open and addressing various issuesq  secretary can you tell us what these sanctions actually do what is different today than was different yesterday before ofac movedsecretary mnuchin well the sanctions are enormously important so by identifying  additional people these sanctions as you know will both freeze assets if theres assets here and prevent us entities from doing business as well as these sanctions have enormous impact with all of our partners around the world who also work with us on these issuesq  as you know the administration is trying to grapple with the paris climate agreement and come to a decision on that where do you stand on it do you support staying in paris or coming outsecretary mnuchin again i would just comment that were having discussions on that and thats where ill go on thatq  the president said last week there would be a tax reform proposal wednesdaysecretary mnuchin he did indeed its been widely reportedq  i imagine that surprised you a little bit what can we expectsecretary mnuchin let me just first say ive been working with the president for over the last year on his economic plan in regards to creating growth the president is very determined that we can get to sustained economic growth of  percent or higher were working on tax reform were working on regulatory reform were looking at job creation and this is something that on the tax side ive been meeting weekly with the house and the senate on designing things and well be coming out as the president said with more details on wednesdayq  secretary thank you very much along the lines of tax reform i know the specifics of the broad details will be delivered on wednesday but without getting into the specifics what does the middle class gain if there is a simplification but also a loss of deductions whatever they might be if we lose the deductions how does that help the middle classsecretary mnuchin well let me just say weve been clear on what the presidents objectives are for tax reform middle income tax cut  a priority of the presidents simplification  the average american should be able to do their taxes on a large postcard business tax reform  we need to make business taxes competitive and we expect with doing that we will bring back trillions of dollars from offshoreq  thank you sir i guess the question i have is to sort of bounce off of what john was asking about this announcement on wednesday it doesnt sound like were going to get the finer details of what this tax reform package will entail is it a good idea to start talking about tax reform  something that you say cant be accomplished by august  when you dont have all the detailssecretary mnuchin well there will be details that will come out and yes i think it is important that were talking about it and we are going to move forwardill just take a couple more right there yesq  can i just follow up on what major was asking you for those of us who are not completely clear about the  employees are you suggesting by looking at these sanctions that there are us companies or they have holdings in the us or they would be traveling or doing some sort of business that were actually freezing or barringsecretary mnuchin again i cant comment on the specifics of these sanctions beyond what we release but i can assure you that when the us puts out sanctions they have impacts both here and throughout the world and we wouldnt be doing this if we didnt think it is impactful its quite impactfulone more back there yesq  mr secretary would you say that simplification of the tax code or cuts would be the first priority youve mentioned both the coast guard secretary mnuchin bothq   and closing the gap with growth but which is the first thing that were going to hear about on wednesdaysecretary mnuchin again what id say on the personal side were about a middle income tax cut and simplification on the business side were about making them competitivethis is the last one go aheadq  can you say if the tax plan will be revenueneutralsecretary mnuchin again what ive said before is the tax plan will pay for itself with economic growththank you everybody nice to see youmr spicer thank you mr secretary and ambassador haley so i just want to kind of walk through what the rest of the day and the week and then well get to some questionsas you know this morning the president had a call with german chancellor merkel who had extended a gracious invitation for the first daughter and assistant to the president ivanka trump to attend the w summit tomorrow ivanka will be in berlin at the w participating in a panel that is entitled inspiring women scaling up womens entrepreneurship this follows the roundtable on vocational education and

interactive tour and discussion with students participating in the apprentice program in commemoration of holocaust remembrance day she will visit the memorial to the murdered jews of europe in berlin a readout of the presidents and chancellor merkels call should be out alreadyfollowing that call the president spoke with dr peggy whitson the commander of the international space station via video teleconference as i told you guys last week dr whitson who is on her third extended stay aboard the international space station breaks the record for the most space time of any american astronaut the president was honored to celebrate this incredible achievement by dr whitson and the american space program and discuss the exciting future of space exploration and space science  including how the inspire women act which the president recently signed ensures that nasa continues recruiting women for important stemrelated jobs in aerospaceafter that as i mentioned at the top the president had a working lunch with un ambassador nikki haley and the other ambassadors of the countries that are part of the un security council under the presidents leadership america has once again taken a leadership role on the world stage and our global partners have welcomed this renewal of american diplomacylater on this afternoon the president will sign a proclamation on holocaust remembrance day

ride home to washingtonas we get closer to the presidents th day in office throughout the week the white house is hosting briefings and events to provide several opportunities for many folks in the press to hear directly from the administration and our officials on what weve achieved in the first  days and what were looking to continue to achieve on days    et ceterathroughout the week the president cabinet officials and senior white house staff will be talking about the presidents agenda on national local media and various platformsfinally i want to acknowledge the distressing reports regarding american citizens coming out of the ukraine and north korea were deeply saddened by the death of a paramedic a united states citizen serving in the organization for security and cooperation in europe  special monitoring mission we extend our deepest condolences to his family friends and loved ones and wish his colleagues who were injured in the blast a quick and speedy recovery we call on all parties to cooperate with the special monitoring mission to allow it to fully investigate this incident the tragic death of a staff member only serves to underline the urgent need for all sides particularly the russianled separatist forces to implement their commitments under the minsk agreementswere also aware of reports a united states citizen was detained in north korea over the weekend the protection of united states citizens is one of our governments highest priorities i would direct any further inquiries on this matter to the state department also on north korea on wednesday the white house campus will play host to a briefing for all us   us senators on the subject the briefers will be secretary tillerson and mattis director coats and general dunford this is a senate briefing convened by the majority leader not a white house briefing we are just serving as the location for further questions id direct you to the majority leaders office and the office of the four briefers with that im glad to take a few questionsq  talking about the budget how committed is  this was asked earlier but can you talk about how committed the president is to having the border wall funded this week or having some funding in that spending bill and if it is not in there will he sign itmr spicer again those negotiations continue with house and senate leadership obviously the money for our military and our border security and wall have been part of that request and that is something that really are the presidents priorities heading in  with respect to the cr and keeping the government openi think we feel very confident where were headed and im not going to get ahead of the negotiations that are ongoing director mulvaney has been very very deep in those discussions and i expect there to be an announcement soon with what  but im not going to start to take things on and off the table with respect to what the president may or may not dophilq  yes sean just doubling up on that question there about the cr debate and the funding does he specifically expect there to be funding for the border wall or would border security measures be enough to satisfy the president and how do you differentiate between the two for example what could be funded in the cr that you could say is part of the wall even if its not explicitly funding for the wallmr spicer theres obviously a lot of components to that youve got fencing and drones and again i dont want to get ahead of those negotiations they are ongoing but the presidents priorities have been very clear from the beginningq  sean just to follow up  are we backing off from the wall are you saying it is on the tablemr spicer no were saying that the president has made very clear that hes got two priorities in this continuing resolution  number one the increase in funding for the military and number two for our homeland border security and the wall but im not going to start to get into  we are having a negotiation with house and senate leadership and to prejudge where it ends up at this point would be  would not be prudentq  two questions for you on the syrian economic sanctions how would the administration determine how effective they aremr spicer well i think theres going to be a lot of ways but i think first and foremost is to send a clear signal to make sure that they understand that we dont take their actions lightly and that we want to do everything we can to have stability in the region so i think theres going to be a lot of ways in terms of their behavior going forward that well know whether theyre working but i think as the president has made clear and secretary mnuchin just did i think we have a lot of tools at our disposal to try to achieve an outcome that brings stability to that regionq  and my second one on north korea the fact that a third us citizen has been detained by the regime in pyongyang does this make it more difficult for the president to negotiate through china to try to denuclearize north koreamr spicer no i think china  and we noted it before ambassador haley noted it in several interviews this morning  but china has been very very helpful in this process and continues to be and i think we hope to see a change in behavior but it is a very positive sign the level of engagement that china has been  has enactedq  is the trump administration calling for the release of this us citizen currently being detainedmr spicer well absolutely i mean we want to make sure that all of our citizens are protected and returned home but the state department is playing the lead on thateamonq  thanks sean you know theres quite a bit of concern among republicans on capitol hill about the federal deficit when you roll out the tax plan on wednesday are you also going to include payfors in there that is those things that raise revenue as well as those things that are tax cuts so that conservatives can be confident that this wont blow a hole in the deficitmr spicer i think we will have further details im not going to get ahead of the presidents rollout but im not going to  the level of specificity in terms of the payfors and the cost well have to see how comfortable the president isjenniferq  sean can you tell us if the president is aware of the american pastor jailed in turkey and did he raise that with president erdogan in the call he made to congratulate himmr spicer im not going to get into the specifics of the presidents conversation were obviously aware of that action and were going to continue to work through the state department on thatjordanq  sean can you explain why president trump didnt use the word genocide to refer to the killing of  million armenians in his statement todaymr spicer yes the statement that was put out is consistent with the statements that have been put out for at least several of the past administrations so i think if you look back to the language that president obama president bush have used the language the president used is consistent with all of thatq  i have two questions on two different topics first the border wall the logistics of that secretary kelly said he still expects construction to start this summer there are still a few ranchers in texas and arizona who welcome the security but are skeptical of giving up familyowned land thats been in their families for generations so what is the white house message to them directly and what  can you guarantee that they will be compensatedmr spicer were going to  we will do everything in accordance with the law this has been an issue that has gone on several times as that issue has been raised over the last several decades  excuse me  several years and so we will do everything in accordance with the law with respect to the land thats needed for that but again the homeland security secretary understands whats going to be needed and will do surveys and the appropriate planning to make sure that we minimize that to the extent possibleq  and on the next question on a different topic  the fbi and justice department last week arrested two doctors in michigan for allegedly performing genital mutilation on little girls as young as six years old its the first case in the united states what is the white house reaction to that casemr spicer weve talked before about having investigations and we dont comment on any pending investigations or actions by the justice departmentmajorq  is  days as the president said on twitter a ridiculous benchmark or an important onemr spicer well i think obviously in the context of an entire administration there is a lot that i think we feel very proud of what weve gotten done and taken care of you look at the immigration piece in particular border crossings way down the number of executive orders and pieces of legislation the president has signed  i think we feel very proud of what weve been able to accomplish and fulfill the promises that hes made to the american people but i think its got to be kept in context and i think thats  there is sort of this artificial number that gets thrown out so on q  what is the contextmr spicer well i mean the context is its  days and four years in your first term and eight years for two terms  that i think q  in the campaign mr trump introduced a contract with the american voter over  days mr spicer right and so again i think when you look at the number of pieces of legislation the executive orders business confidence the uss role in the world  theres a lot that we feel  a lot of accomplishments that have occurred and we feel very good about what weve done as we head up to this first  days but i think youre going to continue to see a lot of action a lot of results going into the second  days the third  days all the way throughq  if in that  days there is no funding  explicit funding for the wall and theres no healthcare reform or repeal of obamacare  would the president consider that and would he invite his supporters to consider that a conspicuous failure based on the promises he made during the campaignmr spicer i think when you look at the totality of what weve accomplished on job creation on immigration on trade it is unbelievable what he has been able to do and so its not  you can cherrypick any couple of things and say okay well what about this and that but i think when you look at it overall in terms of the drop in border crossings if you look at consumer confidence and the relationships that weve developed around the globe and the accomplishments this president has had in protecting the country in bringing back jobs and starting  those have been unbelievably significantand so to minimize that or to look and pick out two or three things  but i think look were going to continue to push for healthcare reform we feel very good about the direction that its going in its been very positive and i think the construction of a wall is going to continue to be an area that moves forward but all of that stuff is happening just as the president asked for and committed to doing some of it has been a little slower but mostly because of working through congress and getting things done but when you think about what he started  hell move forward on tax reform healthcare on immigration on trade  its been a hugely successful first  days q  and without the president necessarily describing it as a failure or not would he say that hes learned something about the process and how long things take that he perhaps didnt appreciate as a candidate maybe he overpromised on the speed with which hed achieve these thingsmr spicer look with all due respect i think that when you look at the list of things in each of the various areas that hes been able to do i think hes very pleased q  im talking about some conspicuous campaign promises that at rally after rally he made and said dont worry its going to happen mr spicer right and i think on healthcare q  all im asking is does he have a different awareness of how difficult those things are than he did as a candidatemr spicer im sure that there are things that you learn on the job but i think that he is very proud of what he has set out to do and the progress that weve made and i think youre going to see healthcare get done but its going to get done right and that in particular is something that were continuing to work at we cant make people vote but weve made significant progress and moved the legislation forward and improved it greatly and i think that we are going to see progress on thatzekeq  thanks sean two questions on two different topics first to follow up on jordan and the other question is on the budget is the president willing to sign a continuing resolution that is not deficitneutral or deficitreducing for instance mr spicer sign a continuing resolutionq  yeah continuing resolutions that would increase the deficit mr spicer i have not seen a score on anything thats come out and i think well have to wait and see what the final q  youre not ruling that out one way or mr spicer im not  not at this pointq  and following up on jordans question the president talked a lot about  he has not been shy about criticizing his predecessors for some of their missteps from both parties and also hasnt  has made a point of often balking inaudible so why not take this moment to label the killing of a millionandahalf armenians a genocide mr spicer i think again as i noted to jordan the statement that the president put out is consistent with the last several administrationsq  inaudiblemr spicer i understand that but it is perfectly in keeping with the language thats been used over and over againjohnq  would you agree with the assessment that some within the administration have that a vote on healthcare this week is very very unlikelymr spicer i think the vote is going to get scheduled when speaker ryan and leader mccarthy and congressman scalise determine that they have the votes and they feel confident i think weve been very clear  the president made it clear on friday when he was walking back over from the treasury department  that if it happens and we have the votes this week great if its next week or the week after but i think we want to make sure that weve got the votes and were headed in the right direction before putting some kind of artificial deadlineq  but would you think that this week is unlikelymr spicer i think that whenever the speaker and the leadership over at the house tell us that they feel confident that they have the votes then we would encourage them to move forward i hate to  im not trying to not answer the question but i think thats the answer it comes down to when they feel as though theyve got the commitments to push the bill forwardq  but there was a push to try to get something on the legislative scoreboard by the th day does it look like that now will not happenmr spicer as i said we have been very clear from here and i think the president has been very clear in his comments that our goal is to get it done and get it done right and get it done to make sure that we have the votes i think there have been some  ive read some background quotes and sources about when it  but weve been very clear publicly about when we want to get that donekellyq  the president has been very clear that judge gorsuch now justice gorsuch is a big part of his first  days accomplishments and the white house in the rollout about the  days said there would be a dinner with the president and all the justices of the supreme court now that is off the list is the dinner not happening or is not publicly being talked about because its wrapped up in the politics of the white housemr spicer i think weve moved some things around on the presidents schedule this week but we hope to have something at some pointq  was it unfortunate to sort of sweep the high court into the politics of  daysmr spicer no i think having a relationship and meeting with the supreme court at some point would be a great idea and something that we hope to have on the schedule some point soonkaitlanq  can you explain the presidents change of thought on dacamr spicer i think hes been consistent about two things one that he has a heart he wants to make sure that he does whats in the interest of children in particular but secondly i think the presidents priorities since he took office have been very clear that the focus would be on folks who presented a danger to public safety and thats what its been and thats where it continues to be and i think he is someone who understands the issue and the priorities that need to get laid out by this country and so everything that he has done has been consistent with what he said from the getgoq  but i understand that he said that the criminals would leave first but last august he said that daca defied federal law and was illegal so does he still think its illegalmr spicer i understand and i think that his comments that he made last week that he understands that in a lot of cases this involves families and small children who have been here and he has a heart and were going to work through the immigration q  but does he still think its illegalmr spicer i understand what im trying to do is answer the question i think the president wants to make sure that he addresses the issue of illegal immigration and all of its components in terms of visa reform border security the wall all of these things in a system of priorities and right now the priority is to make sure that folks who present a publicsafety concern to the united states and to our citizens are dealt with first and thats whats happened hes also very pleased that through his action and his vision for how he wants to move forward on this sees a huge drop of illegal border crossing that is a big accomplishment for this presidency and is something that were obviously very proud ofq  border crossing is a big thing but amnesty is a big part does he mr spicer i understand that ive just walked through the questionjonathanq  sean how confident are you that there will not be a shutdown can you from that podium guarantee that there will not be a government shutdownmr spicer i cant guarantee anything laughterq  how close can you get to confidence mr spicer but i think that the work that director mulvaney and others have made in these negotiations has been very positive they feel very confident that that wont happenq  so he wont insist that his priorities get funded on the border the wall or increase securitymr spicer thats not what i said i said that i think that q  is he willing to shut down the government to accomplish thatmr spicer no its not  look they are currently negotiating we feel very confident that they understand the presidents priorities and that well come to an agreement by the end of fridayq  and on the  days if i could just follow up the contract with the american voter that the president signed included  pieces of legislation right now hes over  and only one of those has been introduced mr spicer right and i think were going to continue to work with congress  as he says in that document i will work with congress to achieve these things we are going to continue to work with congress to achieve thoseq  but why have nine of them not even been introduced yetmr spicer i think when you look at what he has done in terms of the supreme court justice the executive orders the number of legislation theres a lot that has gotten done i dont think anyone  i remember very clearly the first few weeks and still to some extent the comments that got made about the pace that we were keeping and we have kept the president has been extremely busy and i think when you recognize the amount of issues that hes tackled and the amount of progress that hes made it is very significant and we will continue to present all that throughout the week but again as i said to major i think you can look at a few of these areas and nitpick a couple of them but i think overall he has signed a record number of executive orders he has rolled back regulatory reforms q  but this isnt nitpicking these are  pieces of legislation mr spicer no i understand that but q   he promised to take action on in his  daysmr spicer but i dont think theres any question that the president has done a significant amount for the american people on the issues that he has put forward during the campaignq  and just to be clear youre not describing the wall and healthcare as nitpicking are youmr spicer no im not  those pieces are not small but im saying in terms of overall what he has accomplished has been unbelievably significant when you talk about all of the other areas  the regulatory relief the efforts that hes made on immigration on trade all of those issues and again what im trying to say is when you look at everything that hes done and the amount that hes accomplished in these first  days i think you can go back and find an area one or two and say okay well he didnt do this but i think you have to look at it in totality of what he actually did get donejimq  sean on the wall why is there even a discussion about shutting down the government over paying for the wall isnt mexico supposed to pay for the wallmr spicer well i think jim the president has made very clear that initially we needed to get the funding going and theres several mechanisms to make sure that that happens that funding piece will happen in due timeq  but that is a promise that the president made during the campaign time and again mr spicer i understand thatq   that mexico would pay for the wall and now were having a discussion that the government might shut down over the wall and whos going to pay for itmr spicer right so a couple things one as i pointed out to jonathan we feel very confident the government is not going to shut down number two is i think the president has been very clear in the past about the fact that  and this is not a new thing he talked about this  that in order to get the ball rolling on border security and the wall that he was going to have to use the current appropriations process but he would make sure that that promise would be kept as far as the payment of itq  and just a real quick followup if border crossings are down  and thats a talking point that the white house uses time and again  is the wall even necessarymr spicer absolutely the wall does several thingsq  how can the border crossings be down when the president is saying well were going to have all these drugs flowing in if we dont have a wallmr spicer because you cant  just because you have a couple good months in a year i think you want to make sure that you take prudent longterm steps so the president is going to fulfill it and frankly its a promise that he made to the american people i think if you are coming in from our southern border he has taken a lot of steps so far that has deterred border crossing but this is a permanent step that will extend beyond his presidency eight years from now the next president will have that wall in place to make sure that it doesnt continueq  so mexico is going to pay for itmr spicer thats right thank you alexisq  sean this might relate to jims question too but on wednesday  i have two questions on wednesday when we see the outline that secretary mnuchin was just describing will the president help aim congress toward his decision about whether the border adjustment tax is the right idea and also related to that whether the payfors for the wall that might be of interest to lawmakers will become evident as part of the outline of what hed like to do in terms of taxesmr spicer right well i dont mean to evade that but i think theres a reason he chose  were waiting until wednesday to have the details that he wants to share out we got a couple days before that happens so im going to have to ask you to wait  hours q  can you say whether we will have a generally better idea will we have a generally better idea of where his thinking ismr spicer i think you will have a better idea of where the president stands on tax reform and what he wants to accomplish yesjohnq  wait wait i have one followup when you were just describing and secretary mnuchin was describing achieving economic growth of  percent or higher which is slightly lower than what the president talked about in the campaign which was a very ambitious goal of  percent  im just trying to figure out what is the timeline for that is the president thinking he would like to achieve  percent or higher in his first term because of the headwinds that obviously the united states is facing abroad i mean thats a very ambitious goal still   percentmr spicer well and i think that he has taken a lot of steps not just on the tax side but on the regulatory side as well that i think are clearly already paying dividends in terms of what youre seeing  weve talked about this before  manufacturing come back and jobs come back and i think theres going to be a renewed commitment of manufacturers american companies to bring back jobs to grow to hire to expand here in the united states and so i think that that growth will proceed the presidents actions both on the tax front and on the regulatory sidejohnq  thanks so much sean as you know the first goaround at replacing obamacare was not successful since then are you any closer to getting  votes in the house to pass or replace the affordable care actmr spicer yes laughterq  got a numberq  yeah elaborate a little more than yesmr spicer well first of all we only need  youre making it a little tougher on us right now but i do think that we have seen progress with members in terms of some of the changes that have been made to make it a stronger bill but were getting close and as i mentioned at the outset when i think the president feels confident that  or when the leadership of the house tells him that they feel confident that they have the votes then im sure theyll call a vote but thats up to them to decideq  and a separate one obviously a different topic and thats the election over the weekend in france any comment on the results that came out of france over the weekend would the president be satisfied with either alternative macron or le penmr spicer yeah obviously its up to the people of france to decide who their next leader is and we respect the decision that they make in may so lets  our job is to work with whomever the french people chooseanitaq  two questions one on the budget the spending plan what is the president doing i understand mick mulvaney and others are doing things is he calling members i dont see anything on his schedule for this week are members coming over mr spicer as needed hell be involved i think the legislative team has been giving him updates and as he needed q  has he been calling membersmr spicer hes talked to members i just mentioned hes having dinner tonight with senator mccain and senator graham hes had lots of discussion with members at various times this is not  were not at a position now where he is actively engaging the way he was at say the end of healthcare i think as his team tells him that he needs phone calls but he is actively monitoring and been given updates by the senior team that is working with the hillq  when he calls is he talking about his priorities i would like you to include mr spicer i think his priority have been crystalclear i mean remember starting in the first week of march director mulvaney engaged with appropriators on the house side and im not sure when he started so this has been an ongoing discussion now almost for eight weeks with the senior team here and appropriators in the house in particularq  okay and then on the second issue on the  days someone mentioned the president tweeted that it was a ridiculous timetable or whatever why is the white house doing so much this week you have indicated that all these activities this week from hearing from different people are because of the  days why do this day push if its a ridiculous amount of timemr spicer i think weve gotten a fairly decent amount of inquiries from you and your colleagues and so in order to answer those inquiries q  so youre doing something for usmr spicer yeah well you know were givers laughter but i dont think theres anyone in this room that hasnt lodged a request to say were writing a story on the day mark were doing this on the day mark and so we want to make sure that we answer your questions as truthfully as possible and as thoroughly and comprehensively so we will have to fulfill all of these requests that are coming in from you and your colleagues but i also think that we are very proud and the president is very proud of what hes been able to accomplish in the first  days and as we sprint towards these final  days theres two things one i think because of the inquiries weve had we want to make sure we take an opportunity to make sure that people understand how much hes done in all the different areas but we also want to start talking about the next  days and what else is left to be done and how were going to continue to work hard to get all of that done but theres a lot that has been accomplished and i think its appropriate to comment and to share with the american people all the things that he has done to fulfill the pledges that he made to the american peopleq  and just to clarify are we going to hear prior to the rally on saturday are we going to hear directly from him there was some talk of a press conferencemr spicer ill have further updates on the schedule going forwardq  so there will be one or maybe notmr spicer huhq  the press conference mr spicer were working on some scheduling issues for the rest of the week and ill make sure i give you an update as we move forwardkristenq  thanks sean i just want to circle back on healthcare because at the top of the presidents listed agenda items for the first  days was repealing and replacing obamacare so does the president want to expect to see a vote on healthcare this weekmr spicer look hed love to do it if the speaker and the majority leader and the whip come and tell him that theyve got the votes then wed love to do it i think his goal isnt to fit it into a finite timetable as he mentioned on friday if it happens this week thats great if it happens next week thats great too the goal is to get it done and get it done right and so were not going to jam it through just for the sake of itq  so hes concerned about potentially rushing it through mr spicer no no he q  i hear what youre saying is he doesnt want it to happen this week just to meet thatmr spicer exactlyq  okay let me ask you about tax reform i know you dont want to get ahead of the announcement on wednesdaymr spicer thank youq  but theres a sense that it is more realistic to pursue targeted tax cuts as opposed to broad tax reform will we on wednesday see a proposal for targeted tax cutsmr spicer as you stated in your question ill let the president and the team speak on wednesday with respect to what theyre going to outline but im not going to get q  but does the president think that its realistic to do broad tax reform without having to repeal or replace obamacaremr spicer i think that the president said that hes going to q  is it possible mathematicallymr spicer theres a lot of things that are possible but lets let the president  he made a commitment to get it out on wednesday so lets be patient and wait until wednesdayq  and just one moremr spicer of course laughterq  is there a plan for infrastructure reform in the works will we get that before mr spicer thats another thing thats on the list but i think we seem to have our hands full right now with healthcare and tax reform hes obviously still committed to seeing infrastructure something hes talked about a lot in terms of roads and bridges and rebuilding things but lets get these first two things moving but i think youre going to see a continued commitment to infrastructure as wellq  its one of the things that could potentially have bipartisan support is there urgency to get infrastructure reform passedmr spicer laughter so either were doing too much or were not doing enough but i think  look he has made it very clear that that is a priority of his as you point out its something that i think both sides of the aisle of both chambers probably agree on theres a publicprivate partnership that could really benefit our infrastructure in terms of the financing piece of this well have further details on that moving forward thoughthank you guys very much ill see you tomorrow have a great

2017-04-24,Remarks by President Trump at a Working Lunch with U.N. Security Council Ambassadors  ,state dining room am edtthe president this is a very very important and powerful group of people and its really wonderful to have you with us and i have to say welcome to the white house its a privilege to have all of the ambassadors and their spouses you know they were going to leave out the spouses and i said you must bring your spouses laughter you know i heard there were a lot of very angry spouses  laughter  and this is their first time to the white house so its a great honor to those of you that brought your wife or spouseas you know the united states holds the presidency of the security council this month and im glad that we are continuing the tradition of hosting the councils ambassadors in our nations capital its our great honor believe me i want to thank ambassador nikki haley for her outstanding leadership and for acting as my personal envoy on the security council shes doing a good job now does everybody like nikki because if you dont  laughter  otherwise she can easily be replaced laughter no we wont do that i promise we wont do that shes doing a fantastic job and everyone i see  even as we took pictures before  the friendship that youve developed all of you together thats really a fantastic thingthe mission of the united nations and the un security council is to maintain international peace and security these are important aims and shared interests but as we look around the world its clear that there is much work for you to achieve youre going to be very busy people i suspect over these coming months and years our nation faces serious and growing threats and many of them stem from problems that have been unaddressed for far too long in fact the united nations doesnt like taking on certain problems but i have a feeling that people in this room  and i know for a fact that nikki feels very very strongly about taking on problems that really people steered away fromi encourage the security council to come together and take action to counter all of these many threats on syria the council failed again this month to respond to syrias use of chemical weapons a great disappointment i was very disappointed by that the status quo in north korea is also unacceptable and the council must be prepared to impose additional and stronger sanctions on north korean nuclear and ballistic missile programs this is a real threat to the world whether we want to talk about it or not north korea is a big world problem and its a problem we have to finally solve people have put blindfolds on for decades and now its time to solve the problemfor the united nations to play an effective role in solving these and other security challenges big reforms will be required in addition we must also take a close look at the un budget costs have been  absolutely gone out of control but i will say this if we do a great job i care much less about the budget because youre talking about peanuts compared to the important work youre doing you really are youre talking about the most important things ever and i must say im a budget person you see the way im talking about nato the same thing but if you do a great job at the united nations i feel much differently about it because were talking pennies compared to the kind of lives and money that youll be saving the united states just one of  countries in the un pays for  percent of the budget and almost  percent of the united nations peacekeeping which is unfair we need the member states to come together to eliminate inefficiency and bloat and to ensure that no one nation shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden militarily or financially this is only fair to our taxpayersi look forward to a productive discussion about our shared role in keeping the peace advancing reforms and getting everyone to do their fair share i also want to say to you that i have long felt the united nations is an underperformer but has tremendous potential there are those people that think its an underperformer and will never perform i think  and i think especially im so happy with the job that nikki is doing and our representatives  but nikki and the group  and i see the relationship that she has already developed i think that the united nations has tremendous potential  tremendous potential  far greater than what i would say any other candidate in the last  years would have even thought to say i dont think its lived up  i know it hasnt lived up to the potential i mean i see a day when theres a conflict where the united nations you get together and you solve the conflict you just dont see the united nations like solving conflicts i think thats going to start happening now i can see it and the united nations will get together and solve conflicts it wont be two countries it will be the united nations mediating or arbitrating with those countries so i see fantastic potential and fantastic things ahead for the united nations and i have to say its a tremendous honor to know you and to meet you and nikki has given me a little briefing on each and every one of you and i must tell you  i will tell you you know im a very blunt person if she didnt like i would tell you right now  laughter  but she gets along with everybody and respects everybody in this roomill end by saying that  unless you would rather not do it  so we have an office in the white house you may have heard of it called the oval office so what well do is well go down as a group and well take some pictures in the oval office i know youve never seen it nobody seems to get to see the oval office very much but were going to show you the oval office so well go down take some pictures of the oval office and well have a good luncheon and well talk about the united nations and well talk about peacethank you all very much for being here its a great honor and im glad you brought your spouses thank you applause end am edt

2017-04-24,Remarks by President Trump in Video Call with NASA Astronauts Aboard the International Space Station ,via videoconferenceoval office am edtnasa white house this is mission control houston please call station for a voice checkthe president do you hear mecmdr whitson yes sir we have you loud and clearthe president well thats what we like  great american equipment that works and this isnt easy laughter i want to say its very exciting to be here today  very very exciting  and to speak to you live with three brave american astronauts these are our finest these are great great americans great people two join us from orbit aboard the international space station commander peggy whitson and colonel jack fischer and peggy whitson has been setting records and were going to talk about that very soonim here in the oval office along with my daughter ivanka and astronaut kate rubins who recently returned from space and from the space station together we are being joined by students all across america thousands and thousands of students who are learning  theyre learning about space learning about a lot of other things  and theyre watching this conversation from the classroom and all over we have astronauts and we have everybody who are flying right now  miles per hour thats about as fast as ive ever heard i wouldnt want to be flying  miles an hour but thats what you dopeggy jack and kate i know that americas students are thrilled to hear from you but first i want to say that this is a very special day in the glorious history of american spaceflight today commander whitson you have broken the record for the most total time spent in space by an american astronaut   days and counting thats an incredible record to break and on behalf of our nation and frankly on behalf of the world id like to congratulate you that is really something and id like to know how does it feel to have broken such a big and important recordcmdr whitson well its actually a huge honor to break a record like this but its an honor for me basically to be representing all the folks at nasa who make this spaceflight possible and who make me setting this record feasible and so its a very exciting time to be at nasa we are all very much looking forward as directed by your new nasa bill  were excited about the missions to mars in the s and so we actually physically have hardware on the ground thats being built for the sls rocket thats going to take us there and of course the hardware being built now is going to be for the test flights that will eventually get us therebut its a very exciting time and im so proud of the teamthe president great and what are we learning from having you spending your time up there i know so much research is done im getting a glimpse of some of it right here in the oval office what are we learning by being in spacecmdr whitson well i think probably the international space station is providing a key bridge from us living on earth to going somewhere into deep space so on those mars missions we need to better understand how microgravity is really affecting our body and we need to understand it in great detail so many of the studies are looking at the human body were also looking at things that involve operations of a space vehicles on these longduration missions and the technological advancements that will be required for instance on a multiyear mars mission were going to need to be able to close the life support system and that means we right now for instance are taking solar power that we collect and using it to break apart water into oxygen and hydrogen the oxygen we breathe of course we use the hydrogen combine it back with the co that we take out of the air and make more water but water is such a precious resource up here that we also are cleaning up our urine and making it drinkable and its really not as bad as it soundsthe president well thats good im glad to hear that laughter better you than me i will say colonel fischer you just arrived and how was your trip complicated easy how did it gocol fischer oh sir it was awesome it made even my beloved f feel a little bit underpowered i launched in a russian vehicle with my russian friend fyodor yurchikhin from kazakhstan got the immediate perspective change as we got to orbit and i saw that frail thin blue line of life around the earth six hours later were docked at the station the next day i install an experiment in the japanese module thats going to be looking at new drugs and how we can make those drugs for muscular dystrophy alzheimers multidrugresistant bacteria  all sorts of things a couple hours later i watched our crewmate thomas pesquet a frenchman drive a canadian robotic arm to capture a spaceship from virginia carrying  tons of cargo and science thats going to keep us busy for the next few months and dock that to the stationsir its amazing oh and then you know now im talking to the president of the united states while hanging from a wall its amazing the international space station is by far the best example of international cooperation and what we can do when we work together in the history of humanity and i am so proud to be a part of it and its just cool laughter like yesterday i had  well there you go  theres our resident space ninja doing the gravity demonstration and yesterday morning i had my coffee in floaty ball form and sir it was delicious so its awesomethe president tell me mars  what do you see a timing for actually sending humans to mars is there a schedule and when would you see that happeningcmdr whitson well i think as your bill directed it will be approximately in the s as i mentioned we actually are building hardware to test the new heavy launch vehicle and this vehicle will take us further than weve ever been away from this planet unfortunately spaceflight takes a lot of time and money so getting there will require some international cooperation to get it to be a planetwide approach in order to make it successful just because it is a very expensive endeavor but it so worthwhile doingthe president well we want to try and do it during my first term or at worst during my second term so well have to speed that up a little bit okay cmdr whitson laughter well do our best the president oh you will and i have great respect for you folks its amazing what you do and i just want to introduce another great one kate rubins is with us today and she has been so impressive with research and so many other things having to do with nasa and kate i understand youre the first person to sequence dna in space can you tell us about thatdr rubins yeah so that was actually just this last summer and its a real example of what we can do with technology and innovation weve got a sequencer down to the size of your cellphone and we were actually able to fly that onboard the space station and sequence dna its not just the technology demonstration but we can actually use that to do things like detect microbes on the space station look at astronaut health we can easily use that in earthbased settings too to look for disease outbreaks and to do rural healthcare as wellthe president thats fantastic that is really great i saw some of the work and its incredible you know ive been dealing with politicians so much im so much more impressed with these people you have no idea now speaking of another impressive person  ivanka youve been very much interested in this program tell us something about itms trump hi dr whitson first of all congratulations on your incredible milestone today you may know that my father recently signed the inspire women act to encourage female participation in stem fields across all aerospace areas and really with a focus on nasa so encouraging women and girls to pursue stem careers is a major priority for this administrationand today we are sitting with an amazing example of that  dr rubins and you dr whitson so i would love to hear from you what was the impetus for you to get involved in the sciencesdr rubins yeah so when i around fifteen i actually went to a conference and that was very inspiring for me it was sort of the beginning of recombinant dna and understanding biology and so just that exposure to scientists and the kinds of things that you can do with science and technology innovationms trump amazing dr whitsoncmdr whitson for me it was actually the apollo program was my inspiration and that was when it became a dream to become an astronaut but i dont really think it became a goal until i graduated from high school when the first female astronauts were selected and seeing those role models and with the encouragement of my parents and various mentors in college and graduate school and when i started working at rice thats what made it possible i think to become an astronaut and it took me a lot longer to become an astronaut than i ever really wanted it to take but i do think im better at my job because of the journeyms trump youre an incredible inspiration to us all so i would also like to ask you one more question im incredibly curious as im sure all the students across the country are to know what a day in the life in space is like could you share what a typical day looks like what the challenges are just any special momentscmdr whitson well a typical day we wake up and look at the messages from the ground because we have a huge ground team thats working overnight to prepare changes or the details of the tests that were going to be performing over the course of the day so first thing i do is check out that see whats changed but on any given day it can be so dramatically different on one day we might be focusing on science on another day we might be repairing the carbon dioxide removal system on another day soon jack and i are going to do a spacewalk we talked about last saturday we did robotics operations i love the diversity of the different activities that we do plus you know we have over  investigations ongoing onboard the space station and i just think thats a phenomenal part of the dayof course theres also just the living and onboard the space station its such a unique and novel environment nothing that were used to on the ground and its so special to just be in zero gravity so jack is the new guy here and i think he can probably give you a better perspective on what thats like col fischer well you know everything here  my dad always said that if you love what you do you never work a day in your life and we work really hard up here but its not really work its just fun its like playing fort almost only youre changing the world while you do it and then on the off time the other morning i was working out and on our machine that we work out on right below it is the cupola window and so when youre on the device where you do crunches every time you come up you see out the window and its awesome because you kind of go crunch oh my gosh thats beautiful i got to do that again crunch oh my gosh thats beautiful its awesome everything we do here is fun and it feels so great to know that were making a difference on the ground and for the future of humanity as well so its an incredible incredible job the president youre making a great difference i have to say and this is a very exciting time for our country and you see whats happening with our country in terms of jobs in terms of business and theres such excitement and such enthusiasm many american entrepreneurs are racing into space i have many friends that are so excited about space they want to get involved in space from the standpoint of entrepreneurship and business tell us about the opportunities that could exist for the next generation of scientists and engineers is that something that you think a student  because you have so many students hundreds of thousands watching  is that something that you think that students should be focusing or should they be thinking about other subjects what do you think are the opportunities for young students wanting to be involved in spacecol fischer sir absolutely i think that this is probably the most exciting in space exploration certainly in my lifetime we are about to just have an explosion of activity there is so much involvement on the space station with commercial industries and commercial partners we have an entire program to manage the science nasa has done a wonderful job of seeding a new industry with the commercial crew program and the commercial cargo program so that we can build the infrastructure we need for the future exploration one thing i love about american entrepreneurs is once you get them going you better stand out of their way because theyre going to start chucking and were about to that point nasa is taking on that expensive hard complex task of going further and deeper into space with the wonderful new rocket space launch system and orion and then as soon as we break open that door this incredible infrastructure that weve been building is going to be right there to pick up the baton and continue into the stars i would say to all the students that are watching the time to get excited is now if you arent studying science and math you might want to think about that because our future in the stars starts now and you can be a part of that if like dr whitson you can find that passion and work really hard and were going to find a permanent foothold in the stars for humanity if you do thatthe president well thank you so well said and i have to say theres tremendous military application in space were rebuilding our military like never before were ordering equipment and were going to have the strongest military that weve ever had the strongest military that the world has ever seen and theres been no time where we need it more and im sure that every student watching wants to know what is next for americans in space im very proud that i just signed a bill committing nasa to the aim of sending america astronauts to mars so well do that i think well do it a lot sooner than were even thinking so which one of you is ready to go to mars are you ready and i think youre ready i know youre ready right we just discussed that shed like to go to mars very quickly whos ready to go to mars up therecmdr whitson we are absolutely ready to go to mars its going to be a fantastic journey getting there and very exciting times and all of us would be happy to go but i want all the young people out there to recognize that the real steps are going to be taken in a few years and so by studying math science engineering any kind of technology youre going to have a part in that and that will be very excitingthe president i just want to thank you very much and dr whitson i just  congratulations amazing what an amazing thing that youve done everybody here  i know youre family  but everybody here is incredibly proud of the record you just broke i hope that every young american watching today finds in your example a reason to love space and think about space because many great things are going to come out tremendous discoveries in medicine and so many other fieldsso thank you very much i want to say god bless you god bless america we are very very proud of you and very proud of your bravery thank you very muchend am edt

2017-04-21,Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of the Treasury ,memorandum for the secretary of the treasurysubject orderly liquidation authoritytitleii of the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act public law the doddfrank act established an orderly liquidation authority ola using ola the secretary of the treasury secretary may place a financial company in receivership and initiate liquidation after making a determination in consultation with the president that it is in default or in danger of default and its failure and resolution under otherwise applicable law would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the unitedstates among other considerations further under sectionb of the doddfrank act usc b ola shall not be invoked unless and until the secretary determines in consultation with the president that use of ola would avoid or mitigate adverse effects on financial stability in the unitedstates taking into consideration the effectiveness of the action in mitigating those potential effects the cost to the general fund of the treasury and the potential to increase excessive risk taking on the part of creditors counterparties and shareholders in the financial company in addition sectionc of the doddfrank act usc c requires that taxpayers shall bear no losses from the exercise of olathe existence of ola however may encourage excessive risk taking by creditors counterparties and shareholders of financial companies because sectionn of the doddfrank act usc n also created an orderly liquidation fund olf in the treasury of the unitedstates that is authorized to use taxpayer funds to carry out ola liquidations while any losses incurred from theuse of the olf are ultimately supposed to be covered by assessments on other financial companies taxpayer money may always be at risk to the extent that ola provides a government backstop that shields creditors counterparties and shareholders from losses by shifting their losses to the financial sector as a whole it may reduce market discipline andincrease excessive risk taking thus it is critical to understand olas full contours and acknowledge the potentially adverse consequences of its availability and use if olas availability creates a significant risktaking incentive for example the secretary may be unable to make determinations justifying its use as required by sectionb of the doddfrank actadditionally it is important to evaluate the extent to which other legislative solutions such as changes to title of the unitedstates code the us bankruptcy code could fulfill olas policy objectives in a more effective manneraccordingly by the authority vested in me as president by the constitution and the laws of the unitedstates of america and in order to promote certainty in the financial markets i hereby direct you to take the following actionssection  review of orderly liquidation authority a the secretary shall conduct a thorough review of ola and provide a report to the president within days of the date of this memorandum the review shall consider i the potential adverse effects of failing financial companies on the financial stability of the united states ii whether the framework for using ola is consistent with the principles set out in sectionsb and c of executive order of february  core principles for regulating the unitedstates financial system iii whether invoking ola could result in a cost to the general fund of the treasury iv whether the availability or use of ola leads or could lead to excessive risk taking on the part of creditors counterparties and shareholders or otherwise leads market participants to believe that a financial company is too big to fail and v whether a new chapter in the us bankruptcy code in which the claims against a failed financial company would be resolved pursuant to the procedures of bankruptcy law rather than the provisions of the doddfrank act would be a superior method of resolution for financial companies b the review shall include where applicable and feasible a quantitative assessment of olas anticipated direct and indirect effects c the report shall provide recommendations for improvement including any recommended legislative changessec  exercise of orderly liquidation authority pending the completion of the review and submission of the recommendations required by section of this memorandum the secretary shall to the extent consistent with law refrain from making any determination under sectionb of the doddfrank act unless the secretary determines in

expectation that the federal government will shield supervised or designated entities from bankruptcyd whether evaluation of a nonbank financial companys vulnerability to material financial distress under  cfr  app aiid should assess the likelihood of such distresse whether any determination as to whether a nonbank financial companys material financial distress could threaten the financial stability of the united states under  cfr  app aiia should include specific quantifiable projections of the damage that could be caused to the united states economy including a specific quantification of estimated losses that would be likely if the company is not subjected to supervision under section f whether these processes adequately consider the costs of any determination or designation on the regulated entityg whether entities subject to an fsoc determination under section  or designation under section  are provided a meaningful opportunity to have their determinations or designations

2017-04-21,Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer ,james s brady press briefing room am edtmr spicer the un secretary general is in washington for meetings today he came to the white house to meet with national security advisor mcmaster and we anticipate hell be our plan is that hell stop by the oval office and meet with the president today so i just wanted to update you on that well provide a readout after that meeting concludesthe president is also extremely pleased to have aya hijazi and her husband home again after three long years  nearly three long years the president directly engaged behind the scenes on her behalf and made it clear to the egyptian government how important it was to him that this american be released and returnedfor those of you who are not fully aware of the story aya hijazi was running an ngo dedicated to improving the lives of children in cairo nearly three years ago she along with her husband and six egyptian colleagues were arrested and held without trial for almost as i mentioned three years early in the administration the president was briefed on the situation and directed his national security team to figure out ways to address this situation through diplomatic channelsthe president discussed the issue privately with president elsisi when he visited the white house a short time ago and today the president is proud to be welcoming her back to the white house and happy that she is back home on american soil he will be meeting with her and her brother is accompanying her in the oval office very shortly moving on the office of management and budget as required is taking routine steps to prepare in the unlikely case that theres a lapse in appropriations next week following the continuing resolution we have a handout  i dont know if thats already been  okay just to be clear  and again i just want to make sure  we remain confident that were not going to have a shutdown these are required steps that omb has to do in terms of agencies and departments to make sure that they are prepared its part of the agency guidance omb has held these preappropriationlapse calls with agencies since  calls were made once in  for fy once in  for fy and twice in  for fyi would direct you to omb but my understanding is that there is a policy that directs omb to conduct certain activities with these departments within a  i think its a sevenday window and again im not  i dont want to be prescriptive but i believe that its a sevenday window if there hasnt been  as you come up to a cr they must take  theyre required to take certain steps and so they are just going through those routine stepsagencies are required to develop and maintain plans with updates every two years for such an event as i mentioned this is a routine part of the interagency process at the bottom of the handout is a contact number for any further questions you may have  the vice president as you know is continuing on his trip while in indonesia vice president pence and his indonesian counterpart presided over  billion in trade and investment agreements that demonstrate the strength of the usindonesia economic relationship and included delivery of cuttingedge us technologies he also visited indonesias national mosque where the grand imam guided him and his family on a tour of the largest mosque in the largest muslim democracy in the worldvice president pence also announced the president will attend three summits in southeast asia the us association of southeast asian nations  or asean  summit and the east asia summit in the philippines and the asia pacific economic cooperation summit or apec that will be in vietnamon saturday he will visit sydney australia and have a series of meetings with senior australian government officials the vice presidents office has been providing readouts and pool reports and further information on all of that during his trip this weekend the president and the first lady will open the white house gardens to the public on saturday and sunday and finally i know that weve gotten a couple requests from you all about bring your child to work day which is next week  i think anita  one of them i am pleased to let you know that on behalf of the president the first lady the white house will be welcoming your kids to join us at work that day were planning some activities for them and i will have further guidance on that hopefully this weekend were working out some details as you know theres a foreign leader visit that day and were trying to work out some spacing and some other things during the day but anticipate further guidance on that if you want to have your kid comeq  what day is thatmr spicer its thursday right its next thursday q  thats the press conference mr spicer thats right laughter q  my daughter has some questions laughtermr spicer your daughter may get some questions so anyway well try to give you guidance and just plan appropriately in terms of  the lower press will be working with you in terms of getting all that kind of vitals that we need to enter the white house et cetera but plan on a day of some backandforth that we can do with youso with that lets go adamq  sean thank you just a quick question about tax reform and i know the details are not  percent public but there have been trial balloons whatever you want to call them about maybe repealing the deductions for state and local taxes how does that play into middleclass tax relief what does that look like for the middle class in terms of mr spicer im not going to even start to talk about the nature of tax reform i think you heard the secretary  well have something soon in terms of an outline theyve been working for a while now with house and senate leaderships in undergoing the process of engaging with various stakeholders but im not going to start talking about whats in and outmajorq  whats the source of your confidence that there will not be a shutdownmr spicer strong q  no the sourcemr spicer the sourceq  from what does it  why are you so confident what is it that youre seeing or hearing in the backandforth that gives you confidence because yesterday there seemed to be a chill brought into negotiations introduced by the omb director and the request for specific allocations either for the border wall or some limitation on sanctuary cities and that seemed to create a hostile response from some of the people who are not just in the democratic party but are the key negotiators with house and senate republicansmr spicer so you heard director mulvaney yesterday saying a shutdown is never desired and neither is it a strategy and i think we echo that we feel confident weve been working with house and senate leadership and our goal is to continue to do whats necessary to fund the governmentq  right but is it your goal in that process to obtain the presidents spending cut priorities and spending allocation priorities or avoid a shutdown right now you cant do bothmr spicer well i dont necessarily  i think weve made it very clear that we want border wall funding we want greater latitude to deny federal grants to sanctuary cities we want hiring of immigration agents and we want  billion to infuse the military budget those are our prioritiesthat being said i dont think its synonymous with  well continue to negotiate and work with the leadership but no one wants a shutdown we want to keep it going and i get the question but i think weve talked about what our priorities are were working with members on both sides of the aisle in both chambers to find a way forward but i think we feel confident that that will happen that we will avoid a shutdownq  and if push comes to shove and your priorities have to take a backseat they willmr spicer were working with house and senate our goal now is  weve laid out our priorities and were committed to not having a shutdown so i dont know how easier to put itjohnq  yesterday at the press conference the president said that there had been some unusual moves  i assume those were by china  in the last few hours regarding north korea what was that all aboutmr spicer the president obviously is privy to a lot of information hes not going to share everything he knows but theres some things that he saw that were helpful in that  with respect to that subjectq  can you tell us what mr spicer i cannot im not privileged  im not privy  no q  not at liberty to saymr spicer thank you q  also today yesterday the president seemed to indicate that he had liked what china was doing but this morning said if they want to solve this they will it seemed like he was giving x jinping a bit of a pushmr spicer i think weve seen a lot of positive action from china both at the un some of the public statements theyve made on  the president noted yesterday with respect to some  the energy sector so were very  i think that growing off of the relationship that they established down in florida weve seen some very positive signs with china that  to help put the appropriate pressure on north koreaq  but am i wrong in reading that as a little bit of a pushmr spicer no i think the president  he tweeted out a week ago i think if they wont well do it ourselves so this is very consistent with what hes been sayingathenaq  speaking of tweets the president back in october gave a long speech in gettysburg i believe talking about what he wanted to accomplish or hoped to accomplish in his first  days and then just recently he tweeted that it was a ridiculous construct so is it ridiculous is it not ridiculous and what do you guys see as the presidents biggest accomplishments i know were not there yet but were getting close to theremr spicer well youre right i mean we do have a ways to go and i think that youre going to continue to see activity to further that goal so far weve passed  laws weve signed  executive orders weve achieved the first supreme court confirmation in  days since  weve instituted tough immigration policies that have driven illegal border crossings to a year low weve removed more jobkilling regulation through legislation than any president in us historyi think that theres a lot of things that have been accomplished so far and i think youre going to continue to see it were not looking at like a marker and saying lets just rush to it and get to  i think day      were going to continue to press onq  and just two quick followups one is does the president believe that judge gonzalo curiel needs to recuse himself or does he mr spicer im sorry say that q  does the president believe that judge gonzalo curiel should in any way  should recuse himself from this case that hes overseeing on the dreamer and also does the president have a preferred candidate in the french electionmr spicer no and no mattq  sean thank you can you tell us any more about the behindthescenes with getting this american home from egypt when did this become a priority for the president and can you tell us some more about the specific actions he took over the past few months to make that happen mr spicer so as i mentioned  i dont have the dates in front of me but he was briefed by his national security team on a whole host of issues around the world including this one early on in the administration and directed the national security team to begin to take steps and work behind the scenesand again im not sure that its appropriate that i get into it from here but i will say that the team and he in particular brought this up privately with elsisi when he was here during the visit and the team has worked extensively behind the scenes over the last couple months as least to make this a priority and bring her homeand so again i hope you can respect that there are some things that i cant publicly address at this time in terms of the dates but i would say that early on in the administration when he became aware of it he began to instruct his team and then obviously it was something that he believed from a behindthescenes sense was best addressed to achieve in a positive outcome for herq  so he brought it up specifically with elsisi when he was heremr spicer again i dont want to get into it but yes it was brought up and i think weve had obviously very productive and helpful discussions that resulted in her being able to come back to the united stateshallieq  sean forgive me if youve talked about healthcare already but there does seem to be some optimism in the west wing about getting something done perhaps the timeline of next week it seems to be not at all unrealistic from what were hearing from the hill particularly around leadership can you characterize where the president is on this is this the white house sort of trying to get something done before the day mark to point to an accomplishmentmr spicer again were not looking to get something done to point  were trying to get it done i mean i dont think its q  next weekmr spicer if it gets done next week great if it gets done  it will get done when we feel like weve got the votes and weve got a position where were there but i dont  this has not been our goal and i would respectfully say that to  im sorry let me just finish the sentence  to sort of say that we have to have it done by x date  i think the president addressed this yesterday if we can get it done next week great if we get it done the week after great were going to get it done when its appropriate in terms of getting to that  or depending on when some of these members  the specials happen so were not  theres no  it is not our official position to get this thing done by next weekq  but did he move the goalpost a little yesterday because on the campaign trail he said he would do it day one and now hes saying well maybe it will take months maybe it will take longermr spicer well i mean i think we addressed this during the debate its funny  first we rushed it and now were not getting it done quick enough no but im saying  i think he did make it a priority right away we started working with congress and as soon as we can get them to   but that is part of the constitutional process that they get to do and so we are working very diligently with them i think weve had very productive conversations there is a sense of optimism i think in terms of the direction but as soon as speaker ryan and leader mccarthy and whip scalise believe that they have this  i know chairman walden has been doing a tremendous amount of work through his committee in particular to get there and if we get to a point where we feel like theyve got the votes obviously we would be very excited to see a vote happenjeremyq  sean can you characterize the extent of the white houses involvement in the budget negotiations up to this point has there been a recent flurry of activity particularly from director mulvaney and has the white house issued any mr spicer youre talking about the crq  yeahmr spicer fy or q  the funding  the budget showdown to avoid the government shutdownmr spicer okay thats fyq  yes sorry im not a reporter from  and as far as the border wall funding is that something that the white house sees as a sticking point and is that scuttling negotiationsmr spicer i dont know that id say its a sticking point its a priority and i answered majors question to the extent that i think im going to comment on this that weve laid out our priorities and were working with them and i think we feel good about the direction that those conversations are going eamonq  thanks sean these financial executive actions that the president is undertaking today they set off a number of countdown clocks you have the issue to study and conduct a report and theres the day clause and all that at the end of all of that can you give us the presidents specific vision for what he wants to do with doddfrank whats in his mind right now about where this is all going to end up if hes sort of firing the starting gun todaymr spicer i wish you would have asked that question of the secretary of treasury so i will let his responses go im not going to  ill do a little message discipline today laughter katherineq  mick mulvaney said that funding for the border wall is tied to this funding bill this spending bill is this a hard line for the white house and is there any funding bill without funding for the wall and then secondly on a different topic you said there were ongoing developments with regard to the dreamer who was deported do you have any updates you can share on thatmr spicer i think that dhs is the best  when i said  my point then and my point continues to be i think there is some question about how everything played out whether  in this particular case my understanding is he may  when he was stopped and when he wasnt those questions are all best directed to towards the department of homeland security in terms of the exact nature of  or the circumstances surrounding that so i would continue to direct you thereq  and the firstmr spicer oh the first part i just think q  is there a bill without funding for the wallmr spicer well im not going to  i mean obviously director mulvaney is negotiating with the house and the senate weve made very clear that border wall funding is a priorityq  i have a followup on hallies question on healthcare so when youre sitting there at the day mark trying to judge the progress will the president feel like he has delivered on his promise to repeal and replace obamacare if hes tried to do it and it hasnt yet passed does he consider those attempts to be kind of check marksmr spicer no he wants it done he talked about this yesterday and i think his comments yesterday should stand he spoke very clearly that he wants to get it done and his team is making progress but i dont  i mean to hallies point i just dont think  were not looking and saying we have to have it done we want to get it done right and we want to get it done so that it passes the house and so obamacare i think it was  and again dont   months or something like that and i think were well on track weve had an unbelievable  or  days i think right now as we entered in and were looking forward to keeping that activity going for the american peopleaprilq  sean thank you how did the president work with human rights organizations in reference to helping this aid worker come back home after three yearsmr spicer i dont know what ngos specifically like i said i think this was handled primarily through diplomatic channels id be glad that  my understanding is that the national security team in particular was working through diplomatic channels to folks in the elsisi government and then the president brought this up directly during that visit i dont know the extent to which either prior to in the past three years or in the last q  but since hes been in officemr spicer since hes been in office im not sure i know most of this was directly tied to his staff and his actionsq  and a followup on another question on something the topic that ive been asking about on hbcus bennett college is in need of  million by june of this year the president has talked about bolstering or helping them what can this administration do for bennett college as hbcus are a priority for this administrationmr spicer i got to be honest with you i dont know the exact nature of their financial situation and so  i really dont i would  i think maybe the department of education would be a better source for that but i dont know specific universities funding situations and so sorry i cantq  i understand and i appreciate you saying that but when it comes to this and this is being a priority for hbcus  is it beyond the realm of possibility that the department of education would ask for emergency funding specifically mr spicer again april im just not wellversed in terms of the exact nature of a particular universitys funding and what the requirements would be and how that process works so i think its probably a question much better asked to the department of educationandrewq  thank you sean two questions first buzzfeed is reporting that the trump administration is expected to appoint a new special envoy to communicate directly with vladislav surkov a top aide to russian president putin once known as the kremlins grey cardinalmr spicer i dont have anything on that for youq  and the second question  there are reports that the justice department is going to pursue charges against julian assange will the justice department also be considering charges against or requesting extradition of edward snowdenmr spicer we wont comment on ongoing investigations however i think its been pretty clear that the department of justice will prosecute any violations of federal law when it comes to our national securitykaitlanq  the president tweeted that he thinks the terrorist attack  or the assumed terrorist attack in paris yesterday will have an effect on the outcome of the election what effect does he think its going to havemr spicer i dont know i mean i think major events have clearly effects on voters attitudes but im not going to weigh in on  ill let the voters of france decide this sunday what direction they want their country to go injohnq  just on russia sean  thanks four times in four days russian military jets have flown very close to alaskan airspace does this concern the president can you comment on their actions over the last few daysmr spicer were obviously  were aware of it but we conduct  this is not highly unusual nor do we  i mean we conduct military operations in international space and as long as those are conducted in accordance with international protocols and rules then thats obviously  but we monitor everything and any further comment on that i would refer to the department of defenseq  hey sean back on the doj thingmr spicer hold on give me one second let me go to abbyq  thanks sean two quick questions  or maybe more on the egyptian prisoner do you guys have any sense of what made the difference this time around the obama administration tried for some time to free her what was it that you all were able to do that they werent that resulted in her being here todaymr spicer i would much rather take that question offline i think the president and his team worked behind the scenes  i would just leave it at this i think that the president and the team worked behind the scenes in a much more productive way maybe one could look at the tactic that was done to achieve the result and i think at the end of the day were just pleased that shes back home and i think it will be for others to look at the different strategies to see why the president was successful and others may not have over a much longer period of timemajor im sorry i told john and then ill q  well here let major follow and then q  just really quickly related to that because president elsisi has always said that it would be up to the judicial process in egypt to render a judgment on this case and that he had really nothing that he could do through his presidential powers to change the status of mr spicer yeah and thats why q   and so what youre leaving us with the impression is that the president intervened that elsisi intervened and that something outside the judicial process made this happen in ways that didnt occur before is that a fair reading of thismr spicer all im going to say is that we are obviously pleased that she is back home and that the president and the team successfully worked to have her  to bring her back home i understand the question im just saying q  im just going with what president elsisi saidmr spicer i understand that and im just telling you that as this point all im comfortable in saying is that were pleased that she has returned homejohnq  back on the question of snowden but particularly on assange would you wave us off the idea that charges are being prepared against assangemr spicer no i would wave you  i would just  as i said i mean we dont comment on ongoing investigations but i this the departments view has always been that they would prosecute violations of federal law when it comes to our national securityq  does anybody believe that theres been a violation of law when it comes to assangemr spicer i think thats better directed towards the department of justiceanitaq  hi usa today is reporting that the administration is ending its temporary protected status for haitians that are here in the country and allows them to be in the united states when theres been natural disasters it was outlined in a letter from the us citizenship and immigration services can you confirm that and talk to us about it and before you send me to dhs they will not say anything laughtermr spicer okay well then im going to refer you to dhs until they have something to say i dont have anything further for you on this so thank you very much have a good weekend guysend am edt

president by the constitution and the laws of the unitedstates of america including the trade expansion act of  it is hereby directed as followssection  policy core industries such as steel including specialty steel unique to defense applications aluminum vehicles aircraft shipbuilding and semiconductors are critical elements of our manufacturing and defense industrial bases which we must defend against unfair trade practices and other abuses in the case of steel both the unitedstates and global markets for steel products are distorted by large volumes of excess capacity much of which results from foreign government subsidies and other unfair practicesthe united states has placed more than  antidumping and countervailing duty ordersonsteel products but they have not substantially alleviated thenegative effects that unfairly traded imports have had on the unitedstates steel industry repeated efforts by the unitedstates to encourage other countries to reduce and address the underlying causes of excess capacity in the steel market have had little meaningful effectthe artificially low prices caused by excess capacity and unfairly traded imports suppress profits in the american steel industry which discourages longterm investment in the industry and hinders efforts by american steel producers to research anddevelop new and better grades of steel if the present situation continues it may place the american steel industry at risk by undermining the ability of american steel producers to continue investment and research and development and by reducing or eliminating the jobs needed to maintain a pool of skilled workers essential for the continued development of advanced steel manufacturingsec  investigation the secretary of commerce secretary has

2017-04-20,Remarks by President Trump at Signing of the Memorandum Regarding the Investigation Pursuant to Section 232(B) of the Trade Expansion Act ,oval office pm edtthe president thank you very much we appreciate everybody for being here its a historic day for american steel and most importantly for american steelworkers thanks especially to secretary wilbur ross for helping to lead this critical effort weve been working on it since i came to office and long before i came to office were going to fight for american workers and americanmade steel and thats beginning immediately for decades america has lost our jobs and our factories to unfair foreign trade and one steel mill after another has been shut down abandoned and closed and were going to reverse that other countries have made a living taking advantage of the united states in so many ways as you know and ive been talking about that for a long timeas i traveled the country i saw the shuttered factories of the shuttered dreams and i pledged that i would take action and i think its probably one of the primary reasons im sitting here today as presidentand since the day i entered office i have followed through on that pledge big league beginning with our withdrawal from the transpacific partnership which would have been a catastrophe for our businesses and for our workers im very proud of that withdrawal some people say oh gee i wish you didnt do that but the smart people say thank you thank you thank you that would have been another nafta disaster and nafta believe me was a disaster and continues to be a disaster for our countryon tuesday i signed an order to enforce the buy american laws and stop foreign countries from stealing contracts from american companies and essentially from american workers today im directing the department of commerce to immediately prioritize the investigation that began yesterday and really long before that  because wilbur and i have been working on this for a long time  into foreign steel arriving into our markets and to submit a report on the effects of these foreign steel products on the national security of the united states its not just the pricing its not just employment it also has to do with the national security of our country which people never talk about i talked about itmaintaining the production of american steel is extremely important to our national security and our defense industrial base steel is critical to both our economy and our military this is not an area where we can afford to become dependent on foreign countries we have a product where we actually need foreign countries to be nice to us in order to fight for our people and thats not going to happen any longer believe me  especially as it comes to steelthis investigation will look at how steel imports are impacting the united states national security taking into account foreign practices such as steel dumping dumping is a tremendous problem in this country theyre dumping vast amounts of steel in our country and theyre really hurting not only our country but our companies their targeting of american industry and other foreign strategies designed to undermine american industry as a whole based on the findings of this report secretary wilbur ross will make formal recommendations to the white house in a very very near future hell be back very soon with those recommendations that we will implementfrom now on were going to stand up for american jobs workers their security and for american steel companies and companies generally todays action is the next vital step toward making america strong and prosperous once againand i want to just add  i wasnt going to do this  but i was in wisconsin the other day and i want to end and add by saying that canada what theyve done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace its a disgrace i spent time with some of the farmers in wisconsin and as you know rules regulations different things have changed and our farmers in wisconsin and new york state are being put out of business our dairy farmers and that also includes whats happening along our northern border states with canada having to do with lumber and timber the fact is nafta  whether its mexico or canada  is a disaster for our country its a disaster its a trading disaster and well be reporting back sometime over the next two weeks as to nafta and what were going to do about it but what happened to our dairy farmers in wisconsin and new york state  were not going to let it happen we cant let canada or anybody else take advantage and do what they did to our workers and to our farmers and again i want to also just mention included in there is lumber timber and energy so were going to have to get to the negotiating table with canada very very quickly again just to tell you this is another nafta disaster and were not going to let it continue onwardi think what id like to do is ask a few of the people if theyd like to  these are some of the great steel companies of our country now some of those companies were much bigger years ago us steel would be an example and others would be examples but they were much  these were the greatest companies in the world years ago and today theyve been hurt but theyll be great again and theyll be great i think very soon were going to impose very very strict regulations on unfair competition from the outside worldperhaps i could ask the head of united states steel to say a few wordsmr longhi an honor mr president mr secretary i think the signing of this executive order clearly demonstrates your understanding of the fundamental importance that our industry has not just to the national economy but to our national defense the president thank you very much anybody like to say something on behalf of your company or your workersparticipant i would just like to thank you mr president and secretary ross for this action to protect not only our industries our employees but frankly our country so thank you for this bold movethe president thank you very muchmr gerard mr president on behalf of the workers in the industry  president of the steelworkers union  i have worked a long time with wilbur and weve been fighting this unfair trade for more than  years hopefully this executive order will give us the tools we need to grow our companies back and put people back to work and i have lots of faith that secretary wilbur ross will help make that happenthe president i have to say the unions have been working with us very closely and theyve been great so i appreciate that thank you very muchso were going to sign and this is a very important signing and well be back over a period of the next  to  days i would say and maybe sooner than that but statutorily we probably want to take a very good strong hard study and were going to do something really great for our industry but in this particular case for the steel industry i look forward to it toothe president signs the executive orderso should i give this pen to labor or to steel laughter and im going to look at it and theyre going to be a partnership so how about we give it to the union for a change should we do that come on you treat us fairly thats all okay you treat us fairlyq  mr president how will this affect your dealing with china on north korea are you concerned that this will

of great american and japanese business executives  companies like aflac ibm toyota general motors all of you are pillars of our shared prosperity and join me in a round of applause for these great business leaders who have joined us here today we are truly honored by your presence applause your businesses create jobs and drive innovation in the united states and in japan and thanks in no small part to your hard work the economic partnership between the united states and japan will continue to grow and flourish of that im confidentour two nations have powered the global economy for decades and today we account for nearly a third of the worlds gross domestic product and the trade between us is an important factor to our successin  japan was the united states fourthlargest goods exports market from aircraft to medical devices machinery to pharmaceuticals the united states has sent more than  billion worth of goods to japan last year alone when you add in services our annual exports are closing in on  billion supporting more than  goodpaying american jobsour countries have also invested historic sums in each others economies america is a top foreign direct investor in japan with over  billion investedand the benefits flow both ways today japaneseowned businesses employ  american workers and japanese foreign direct investment in the united states topped a stunning  billion  the second most of any nation in the world and america is grateful applause i know from firsthand experience how important japan is to the american economy and some of these business leaders i actually met in my old job as governor of the state of indiana in  and  i led a group of business and community leaders here to japan ill always be incredibly appreciative of the more than  billion in planned investments and the nearly  jobs in the state of indiana that have been created by japaneseowned firms during my time in office i must tell you that i saw firsthand in the state of indiana more than  japanese companies that came not just to do business but to help build communities and the relationship that i saw develop in communities large and small across my heartland state could only be described with that japanese word kizuna its a bond its a bond of friendship of shared heritage and shared valuesand now as vice president im grateful to all the japanese businesses that are investing all over the united states at this very moment i believe the best is yet to comeever since president donald trumps election japanese businesses have dramatically increased their commitment to the american economy and were grateful last december for instance softbank announced a  billion investment in the united states creating  new american jobsand in january toyota unveiled a  billion investment in america and just last week dedicated more than  billion to a plant in the state of kentuckythese are only a couple of examples of many more that i could name at the podium today the truth is though is that our economic partnership with japan could still be even stronger and thats why president trump is taking critical steps to strengthen our bond in the years aheadpresident trump has made it clear that our administration will strengthen our international trade relationships using a bilateral approach and yesterday at the presidents direction i met with japanese deputy prime minister aso to kick off the usjapan economic dialogue and weve gone straight to work applausethis dialogue presents the united states and japan with the opportunity to deepen our bilateral economic ties and to foster jobs prosperity and growth on both sides of the pacificin yesterdays meeting with the deputy prime minister we broadly discussed how we view the dialogues structure and goals that dialogue we decided will focus on three key policy pillars in the months aheadthe first is to seek a common strategy on trade and investment rules and issuesunder president trumps leadership the united states seeks a stronger and more balanced bilateral trade relationship with japan our goal is simple we seek trade that is both free and fair and benefits both our nations equallythis requires breaking down barriers and leveling the playing field so that american companies and exporters enjoy high levels of market accessthe second pillar involves economic and structural policies with a specific focus on fiscal and monetary issuesthe president believes that both the united states and japan can enact progrowth and fiscally sustainable monetary and budgetary policies which are both key to our longterm economic successand the final pillar is what we call sectoral cooperation the president and i are confident that we can find new ways to expand our economic ties with japan in different sectors and industries in fact as we discussed earlier today with business leaders one of the areas we agreed upon is to examine ways that we can promote and advance women empowerment in business in the united states and in japan applause american and japanese businesses have much to offer each other and by working together the president and i believe that we can ensure that our two nations economic leadership grows even stronger in the years ahead to the benefit of the entire worldpresident trump and i are grateful that prime minister abe and deputy prime minister aso share our goal of a mutually beneficial economic relationshipand as members of the business community all of you will play an integral role in helping us identify where and how we can make the most impact in the days aheadpresident trump and i value your continued input on the issues that you face and we know that you can help us move toward a system that maximizes jobs growth and a brighter future for japan and the united states of americathe truth is simply that a stronger american economy means a stronger economy for japan and for all our trading partners the united states and japan are drivers of global growth and under president donald trump i can promise you the united states will drive growth like never before applausepresident trump and our entire administration are working around the clock to pass an agenda of lower taxes less regulation better infrastructure and a renewed focus on american energy im sure youll be glad to know that tax reform is one of our top priorities i dont have to tell you how complicated the american tax code is and how much harm it does to business investment in our country  at home and frankly abroadour corporate tax rate sadly is one of the highest in the developed world  its more than  percent higher than the tax rate here in japan president trumps tax plan is to slash the corporate rate and reform the tax code and make it simpler flatter and fairerrest assured our tax reform plan will make the strongest economy in the world stronger still and it will benefit every business represented here today applausethe same is true of the presidents energetic actions from the outset of our administration to reduce the regulatory burden in america the president already ordered every agency in washington dc to find two regulations to get rid of before issuing any new red tape on the american economy and the american peoplethe president has also signed more than a dozen bills turning back the last administrations excessive regulatory mandates and were going to continue to work with congress to slash through the red tapemake no mistake about it under president donald trump the era of overregulation in the american economy is over and a new era of jobs and growth has begun applausenow these are just a few of the presidents policies that i could discuss today i appreciate the feedback i received from so many of you at our earlier conversation about what our administration can continue to do to create an environment on both sides of the pacific where we can grow and thriverest assured president trumps agenda in america will renew our countrys reputation as the premier investment destination in the world which will benefit both of our countries and all the enterprises gathered hereand our success will further strengthen our bond with the businesses and the people of japan of that im certainthe truth is that both our nations seek the same thing we want goodpaying jobs for our people we want more investment and higher growth we want innovation and hightech companies and we want our people to be more prosperous tomorrow than they are today these are shared goals and theyre shared values and i can tell you that under president trumps leadership and working closely with prime minister abe theyre the shared expectations of both of our peoples were looking forward to working with all of you and with the leadership here in japan to achieve that aimthis is a historic time in the relationship between our nations for more than  years the united states and japan have built on a foundation of freedom and friendship and together weve become the pillars that support opportunity and prosperity around the worldtoday i say with confidence with your continued help through an enduring alliance and economic partnership and under president donald trump our nations will reach new heights for the benefit of all of our people and for the benefit of the worldthank you so much for having me here today and thank you for the opportunities that the enterprises here represent in america and in japan and god bless you all applausethe mount fuji dialogue award is presentedend

2017-04-18,"Gaggle on Background on Buy American, Hire American Executive Order ",aboard air force oneen route joint base andrews  pm edtq  on the eo are you asking agencies to consider getting rid of the lottery systemsenior administration official well i think that the question is  the lottery system right now has no regard for skill wages salary et cetera so if there is a way to not have it be random but take into consideration all of those things thats something that should be pursued what can be done administratively and what can be done legislatively is part of what were asking agencies to tell us theyve never been asked to go through before and look at all of the reg all of the rules of all of the guidance documents and come back with the answer to that questiontraditionally you can have a similar effect by raising the fees or the wages paid to hb workers because it wouldnt be a random lottery anymore because a lot of the folks that benefit from a random lottery that wouldnt be able to anymoreq  can you repeat that im so sorry i didnt hearsenior administration official so if you raise the fees or the wages paid to hb workers it has the effect of replacing a random lottery system because even if youre still doing a lottery its not random because youre excluding from that lottery folks that are paid well beneath the market wage or if you raise the hb fees companies that are not looking for skilled workers  because if theyre looking for skilled workers foreign workers youre obviously willing to pay a premium if youre not willing to then i suggest that you perhaps have a different idea in mindq  what do you say to the criticism one that this is ultimately going to have the adverse effect that ultimately youre going to look for skilled laborers from outside of the country and two that the people who want to see action thats not actually demanding any action its just asking for a reviewsenior administration official the irony of the second one is you have reporters saying why an executive order why not just pick up the phone and tell them to do it well thats the point the most muscular thing you can do is an executive order so im starting on your second question first q   than an executive ordersenior administration official the best thing that you can do in the realm of administrative action is an executive order and so agencies now know that when theyre asked to give us the full total menu of all options its because the president of the united states has demanded it and specifically demanded it in the context of an executive order which says its the policy of the government to promote job opportunities and higher wages for american workers and so specifically on the wage point lets say youre going to prioritize higher wages for american workers youre telling these agencies to find ways to avoid allowing guest workers to be used at beneathmarket payso an executive order is a very muscular way of getting the agencies to begin that process and remember if you go back to the obama administration they did some rulemaking on guest worker policy and it wasnt done through the executive order process and nobody said with that that it wasnt strong action of course it was a strong action in the other direction were going to be even stronger than that though because this is done under the cover of a presidents executive orderto your first point  she asked another question  so you do get some criticism thats true from employers who rely on contract laborers who are trying to cut labor costs but the job of the united states government is not to be representative to  and companies will always try to get an advantage by cutting labor costs thats the job of a company its not the job of the american government to have a race to the bottom trying to help any particular company reduce labor costs to the lowest degree possible its the job of the united states government to represent the interest of the nation as a whole and the interests of the nation as a whole is to have higher wages paid to american workers in particular or in general and stemtrained american workers specificallywe actually have  to finish the part of your question about looking elsewhere  we actually have a massive supply of american workers who are trained in stem  a lot of great literature and research is done in this area  that graduates from college with stem degrees not able to find employment or conversely they worked in a stem field for many many years and laid off in the prime of their career so the evidence of that point is clearly substantialq   today said that it was hard for them to find enough trained workers to do the kind of jobs that they have in the ussenior administration official specifically are you referring to stem jobs or a different kind of fieldq   the kind of jobs senior administration official  tech field for instance there are tens of thousands of tech layoffs on an annual basis so are we saying that those workers the one who are laid off have lost their entire skill training and careerjust imagine for a second youre one of the tens of thousands of laidoff tech workers watching tv being told there arent american workers trained to do these jobs that must strike you as a very incongruous statement when you yourself have been laid off but the point about  if a company says its hard to find a worker to do a job any particular job the answer to that is not to use immigration policy as a substitute for training and employing our own workers thats why we had gateway technical college at the event today to highlight the need for vocational education in our countryso regardless of which thing is true in a particular circumstance the answer still isnt to bring in lowcost labor in other words if an american worker is available hire them and hire them at an appropriate wage if an american worker is not available the solution is not to bring in another worker from another country to do a job the solution is vocational education and training q  so two followups on that youre talking about  lets accept your premise that there are domestic workers that are capable of doing this two questions why not just do an executive order that raises the fees as you have described enacting that policy instantly thats the first question and secondly on this issue of the older workers why not incentivize through the tax system or create some program in terms of educational subsidies that gives american companies an incentive to hire these older workers who as we know are often kicked to the curb by tech companiessenior administration official well the discount for hiring an hb worker over an american worker to be  is  i wont get right now into specific cases but theres some highprofile examples where large numbers of american workers were laid off and replaced by foreign guest workers and the wages kind of ranged between  and  so its very hard for workers to compete with a  wage discount for a worker who comes here on a threeyear visaq   attack it right now instead of studying the thingsenior administration official  your question first it is not like a  sometimes you hear like businesses are offering a  or  percent margin these are sometimes  percent salary discountson the first point theres a administrative process that has to be followed to get that done i dont want to get into the details of what that is i dont want to prejudge the very complex process with respect to rules and regulations but it was our judgment that we would have the most profound effect in the end by starting with the general instruction to agencies to come up with a full menu of reforms to move forward onq  how soon would you like to have this review donesenior administration official well starting immediately in other words literally this afternoon the work has already begun q  but when do you want to hear backq  whats happening this afternoonsenior administration official the workers at the agencies are already beginning to do research in response to the presidents orderq  and when would you like to hear backsenior administration official i imagine well be hearing back on some possibilities in days and others in weeks but the timeline for implementing different kinds of reforms depends on the preexisting architecture of  again i dont want to prejudge but the rulemaking process is a complex one and different actions  some require to go through the inaudible some dont require going through the inaudible i dont want to tie our hands by elucidating all the possible options but there are many q   buy america half of this yesterday you talked about how if after the review of the waivers specifically it was found that those are not good deals for america those waivers the trade agreements could be either revoked or reformed in some way is that  i didnt see that language specifically in the eo though maybe i missed it is that still something thats a possibilitysenior administration official  the first ever review of worldwide procurement procedures that includes looking at all of our free trade deals in wto that affect procurement and we believe that that will show that it has not been reciprocal that we basically gutted our own buy american laws and not for the same amount of sales in return for our products in other countries when those determinations come back logically that would lead to a decision about what aspects of trade deals or wto arrangements could be revisited but additionally the public interest waiver which is the broadest waiver in buy american has been abused the most and further by saying that calculating the price of a particular bid that you can take into account the use of dumped steel also means that a lot of folks that are currently winning binds from foreign countries presumably wouldnt be able to win those bids anymore if theres a finding that theyre using dumped goods so that will certainly change a lot of outcomesbut look a lot of this has to do with  using that same word again  extremely muscular implementation and all the agency heads now have to be accountable to the president of the united states the order putting waivers on their desks they now have to answer to the president for every decision they may make about a waiver and that introduces an enormous amount of accountabilityq  i just want to follow up on gwens question it sounded like what you were saying was that im in favor of  that its very likely that fees will be raised the number of hb visas or the pendulum may be shifted senior administration official i dont want to  were going to get a full menu of options from the agencies that will comply with the presidents order but continueq   what you were saying was part of the reason to go through the study and to do it that way in addition to just gathering information and doing the factfinding is that its just a better likelihood of where you kind of think you probably are or leaning towards doing sticking if you run through the full process  is that kind of a fair way to think about itsenior administration official yeah i mean youre  let me rephrase just so  were dealing  the rules that govern hbs are four agencies four departments right you know this ill indulge myself in rephrasing so you have four  each of them have their own set of rules and regulations in one case you have an department that doesnt even have a confirmed head of a department yet and each of those rules and regulations and memos all have their own governance proceduresthe best hope of having the most comprehensive solution is to give those agencies the ability  and departments  to dig deep and come up with the most robust set of options possible and then methodically implement themqq  and then just to follow on steves question about the timing  i think the reason we keep  its not to be pesky its really to understand i think  when on the background call  when the day thing  so i think everyone is thinking is nothing going to happen before  days senior administration official well so thats a different thing so on the procurement side the thing thats supposed to happen immediately is drastic minimalization of waivers and especially public interest waivers and much much tougher enforcement and much much more accountability so in other words q  and that will happen as soon as a matter of weekssenior administration official in other words from now on when any waiver request crosses anyones desk it has to immediately comply with the terms of the executive orderq  is there a time frame coming up that you can share with us just that we can keep our eyes on senior administration official no as soon as i get that information ill let you know but the q   focus on action that is demonstrable action thats going to happen sooner rather than later what did you say the drastic minimalization of the public interest waivers be something for us to look atsenior administration official yeah thats right thats the q  thats something we can assert in our storyq  well before  dayssenior administration official every executive order  im sorry every public interest waiver that comes through now has to  or the request has to comply with the executive order full stopq  how many people typicallysenior administration official i mean its a complex patchwork of projects across state local and federal that have any kind of federal q  can you retroactively review existing ones and retroactively denysenior administration official i dont want to give you an answer to that without being better informed on the question okay so then on the  so all the reports and things that are  days out should best be understood as monitoring the progress and the success in accomplishing the immediate change so thats the very important point is that immediately were saying comply with these executive instructions with every waiver that comes across your desk and then some days later were going to check in on your reports  to figure out how to maximize accountability and to give us the broadest range of information about what further actions had to be takenon the immigration piece as soon as practical means just that when a president issues and executive order and it says move as soon as practical then that is what is going to happen and so as soon as were able to move is exactly how soon we will move in other words we will move  how do i put this  whatever the quickest responsible time frame possibly is it will be that time frame and no slowerq  when you talk about muscular  if you could expand on that what does that mean i mean is that basically speaking more loudly to your agencies or does that carry legal standard by having an executive order to help if it gets tied up in court saysenior administration official well this is  so theres nothing litigable here in other words the directing agencies in the case of  lets just  the immigration piece for instance were fortunate in that with visa and immigration law that we have extraordinarily robust laws already on the books and in fact you look up the citation thats in these executive order referring to the entry of foreign labor and so directing agencies the o immediately enforce all of the various rules and restrictions governing entry of workers from abroad is against  its not litigable i mean youre just saying use the laws and tools you have right now to the greatest extent possible to protect american workers so that is an immediate muscular instruction muscular is just the term im choosing to use to q   ask one thingsenior administration official yeah go aheadq  youre talking to your own agencies right so they report to you so why do you need to have an executive order to make them do something since they work for you right i mean im missing something maybe because i thought an executive order went beyond that that youre creating some sort of legal justification for a thing that doesnt do senior administration official an executive order is a signal to every single worker in the federal government including career workers  everyone across the federal government that it is a order from the president of the united states memorialized in writing with all of the enormous legal ramifications of it being an executive order in terms of the chain of command in the executive branch i would probably rephrase this  i would say  legal ramifications i would say just  the administrative ramifications of saying that this is an order from the president of the united states there is no higher statement of executive direction than the form of an executive order and so when youre dealing with  look at like our immigration order on border security which was an executive order and look at how much of an effect that has had being in the form of an executive order q  but it was litigatedsenior administration official no no no were talking about q  but it was right this is differentsenior administration official were talking about a whole bunch of different things but the executive order on border security has  to my knowledge nothing in it has been subject to litigation but regardless  in other words the executive order on border security and the one on interior immigration enforcement but regardless  were getting a little bit off track with like all this q  was there anything that you seriously considered in one of your drafts for this that was removed because of the potential for litigation senior administration official no because the absolute best way to get the best result is the formula thats in this executive order period and remember weve done a great number of different executive actions and each executive action requires a different approachlike for instance in the case of  to cite an obvious example that i know is on your mind in the case of  travel restrictions the last stipulates it must be done by presidential proclamation so everything just depends upon lawyers best judgment about what is the most appropriate way to construct something to have the best policy outcomeq  just to clarify something you said you said that you didnt want to speak about what he can go back and renegotiatesenior administration official he asked me a question that q  existing waiverssenior administration official  that i havent  he asked me a question that i havent contemplated or spoken q  yesterday  the guidance that you guys put out yesterday says if it turns out america is a net loser because of those free trade agreement waivers which apply to almost  countries those waivers will be promptly renegotiated or revoked im just trying to understand senior administration official he was asking a different question q  the public interest waiverssenior administration official i think you two are having a different conversation now q  whats the difference between these waivers thenq  theyre entirely different waivers for us because q  then i dont  this just says waivers of buy american senior administration official youre i think talking about free trade deals and i believe youre quoting the senior administration official who said something about how in the course of investigating free trade deals that if provisions in those trade deals proven to be harmful to buy american then we could renegotiate or even rescind those provisions i believe the question that you asked was q  there are waivers that are written into the covenants of the trade deals is what youre saying q  yeahsenior administration official right thats the question that youre askingq   the public interest waivers that you were  as part of the senior administration official the public interest waivers are part of federal law governing buy americaq  for bidding senior administration official yeahq  yeah yeah yeah its for biddingsenior administration official and you asked a question about some kind of a q  okay so im just forgetting that one is for free trade agreements senior administration official right you had a different question about sort of a preexisting waiver under buy american law could it be revisited in the case of like an ongoing contract or something and i just sort of hadnt really studied that questionsenior administration official all right thanks guyssenior administration official thank youq  thank you appreciate your coming back thanks for coming backq  sarah really quickly did you get an answer to whether the president submitted his taxesms sanders i will before we land do you all have any other followups from earlierq  do you know what the dairy thing he was talking about was the

you guys are getting about this call to turkey do you have any regrets about making that callms sanders no again the president is putting americans safety first and foremost and why would he ever regret taking steps to protect americans q  could you have done that call without congratulating him or taking a step toward enhancing his own powers that some people are very worried aing democracyms sanderse its about developing the relationship and being able to have that open conversation and thats what they did and no he wouldnt have any regrets about thatq  any further update on north korea has the president talked to his advisors for an update or anything like thatms sanders hes continuing to be regularly updated and monitoring that situation very closely q  you dont have any kind of timing guidance or nextsteps guidance on north korea that you can sharems sanders i think weve made pretty clear that the president is not going to lay out a plan one way or the other but again hes keeping a very close eye as well as interagency communication watching that situation very closely q  no further calls to the chinese that you can ms sanders not in the last hour q  one very quickly on georgia does the president see this as a referendum on his first  daysms sanders i wouldnt use the word referendum i think he hopes to have a republican elected to that seat and hopefully it will

the kind words and the hospitality you have shown me and my family in welcoming us to the republic of korea my very first stop in the asia pacific as vice president of the united statesits a great honor for me to be in south korea today and i bring greetings from the president of the united states president donald trump and on his behalf i am here to express the unwavering support of the united states for our longstanding alliance with south koreapresident trump and i are grateful for your strong partnership with the united states we commend you personally for your steady hand in this time of transition in south korea  the president and our entire administration admire the south korean peoples commitment to the rule of law and the democratic process  and we look forward to the upcoming election with great anticipationwhile change is coming on may th the people of south korea may be assured  whatever change happens in your elections the commitment of the united states to south koreas safety and security will remain unchangedon behalf of the president of the united states my message to the people of south korea is this we are with you  percent even in these troubled times we stand with you for a free and secure futurethe united states of america stands shouldertoshoulder with the republic of korea and the service and vigilance of some  us soldiers sailors airmen and marines on this frontier of freedom stand as a testament to the enduring partnership between our peoplethe alliance between south korea and the united states is the linchpin of peace and security on the korean peninsula and indeed throughout the asia pacificthe united states commitment to south korea is ironclad and immutable and under president trumps leadership i know our alliance will even be stronger our nations will be safer and the asia pacific will be more securenowhere is that more evident than with our commitment to confront the regions most dangerous and urgent threat to peace and security  the regime in north koreasince  the united states and our allies have stood together for a denuclearized korean peninsula we hope to achieve this objective through peaceable means but all options are on the tablejust in the past two weeks the world witnessed the strength and resolve of our new president in actions taken in syria and afghanistan north korea would do well not to test his resolve  or the strength of the armed forces of the united states in this regionwe will continue to deploy the thaad missiledefense system as a defensive measure  called for by the alliance and for the alliance we will continue to evolve a comprehensive set of capabilities to ensure the security of south korea and as our secretary of defense made clear here in south korea not long ago we will defeat any attack and we will meet any use of conventional or nuclear weapons with an overwhelming and effective responsestrategic patience has been the approach of the last american administration and beyond for more than two decades the united states and our allies have worked to peacefully dismantle north koreas nuclear program and alleviate the suffering of their people but at every step of the way north korea answered our overtures with willful deception broken promises and nuclear and missile testsover the past  months north korea has conducted two unlawful nuclear tests and an unprecedented number of ballistic missile tests even conducting a failed missile launch as i traveled here for this visitthe era of strategic patience is overearlier this month president trump spoke with you acting president hwang to reaffirm the strength of our alliance as i reassured you today we will continue to closely consult with south korea and your leadership as we make decisions moving forwardwe also call on other regional powers and the entire international community to join us to confront north korea and demand that it abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs to turn away from renewed hostility towards its neighbors and to end the repression of its own peopleearlier this month president trump met with chinese president xi at the southern white house the two leaders noted the urgency of the threat posed by north koreas weapons programs and each of them reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized korean peninsula during that meeting on april ththey also committed to fully implement un security council resolutions and to increase cooperation to convince north korea to abandon its illicit weapons programsit is heartening to see china commit to these actions but the united states is troubled by chinas economic retaliation against south korea for taking appropriate steps to defend itself the better path would be for china to address the north korean threat that is actually making such defensive measures necessarynow while issues like that remain the president and i have great confidence that china will properly deal with north korea but as president trump made clear just a few short days ago if china is unable to deal with north korea the united states and our allies willso today it is my privilege on behalf of president trump to reaffirm the united states enduring commitment to the security and prosperity of south korea and to assure the people of south korea of our unbreakable bond we are bound together by our shared values but also by our shared sacrifice a free and democratic south korea was forged in the fires of sacrifice by soldiers from both our lands and my father was one of themsixtyfive years ago second lieutenant edward j pence of the th infantry division in the united states army fought alongside brave south korean forces to win the freedom of this landwhile he came home to raise a family he had friends in uniform from america and korea who went home to eternity so too the friendship between our two free nations is eternal we have bled together we have prospered together and on that foundation the people of the united states of america and south korea will face the future togetherwith courage determination and faith  we go together katchi kapshidaso thank you mr acting president for your hospitality it is a great great honor to be with you today applauseend ,20636.919922,-113.640625,-0.005506665986470847,5856.790039,-7.319824000000152,-0.0012498013333682614,2349.01001,-6.820068999999876,-0.0029033801350211684

states and its allies he did a terrific job just watched parts of it  an absolutely terrific jobsixtyeight years ago this month not far from where we are gathered today president harry truman spoke at the signing of the north atlantic treaty in the nearly seven decades since harry truman spoke those words the nato alliance has been the bulwark of international peace and securitynato allies defeated communism and liberated the captive nations of the cold war they secured the longest period of unbroken peace that europe has ever known this enduring partnership rooted out of so many different things but our common security is always number one and our common devotion to human dignity and freedom since  the nato member states have more than doubled increasing from  to  on monday i signed the protocol to approve the th  the country of montenegro in the coming months and years ill work closely with all of our nato allies to enhance this partnership and to adapt to the challenges of the future  of which there will be many this includes upgrading nato to focus on todays most pressing security and all of its challenges including migration and terrorism we must also work together to resolve the disaster currently taking place in syria we are grateful for the support of nato members and partners in their condemnation of assads murderous attack using the most horrible weapons the vicious slaughter of innocent civilians with chemical weapons including the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies must be forcefully rejected by any nation that values human life it is time to end this brutal civil war defeat terrorists and allow refugees to return homein facing our common challenges we must also ensure that nato members meet their financial obligations and pay what they owe many have not been doing that the secretary general and i agree that other member nations must satisfy their responsibility to contribute  percent of gdp to defense if other countries make their fair share instead of relying on the united states to make up the difference we will all be much more secure and our partnership will be made that much strongerthe secretary general and i had a productive discussion about what more nato can do in the fight against terrorism i complained about that a long time ago and they made a change and now they do fight terrorism i said it was obsolete its no longer obsolete its my hope that nato will take on an increased role in supporting our iraqi partners in their battle against isis im also sending general mcmaster to afghanistan to find out how we can make progress alongside our afghan partners and nato alliesevery generation has strived to adapt the nato alliance to meet the challenges of their times  and on my

meeting and its really an honor to meet you for the first time here in the white housewe agree that nato is a bedrock of security both for europe and for the united states two world wars and a cold war have taught us all that peace in europe is not only important for europeans but is also important for the prosperity and the security of north america so a strong nato is good for europe but a strong nato is also good for the united statesand therefore i welcome the very strong commitment of the united states to the security of europe we see this commitment not only in words but also in deeds over the past months thousands of us troops have been deploying to europe a clear demonstration that america stands with allies to protect peace and defend our freedom and yesterday you announced the completion of the ratification of montenegros membership in nato another expression of your strong commitment to europe and to the transatlantic bond and we thank you for that in a more dangerous and more unpredictable world it is important to have friends and allies and in nato america has the best friends and the best allies in the world together we represent half of the worlds economic and military power no other superpower has ever had such a strategic advantage this makes the united states stronger and saferwe saw that after the  attacks on the united states that was the first time nato invoked our article  the collective defense clause allies sent awacs surveillance planes to help patrol american skies and we launched natos biggest military operation ever in afghanistan hundreds of thousands of europeans and canadian soldiers have served shouldertoshoulder with american troops more than a thousand have paid the ultimate priceearlier today i laid a wreath at arlington national cemetery in tribute to the fallen it was a deeply moving experience we owe it to our servicemen and women to preserve the hardearned gains we have made together in afghanistan we were reminded of their sacrifice just this week when a us soldier was killed there fighting isil our mission in afghanistan is a major contribution to the fight against international terrorism nato plays a key role in many other ways also all nato allies are part of the global coalition to counter isil and nato provides support to the coalition with training for iraqi forces in their fight against terrorists and more intelligencesharing and you are right we have established a new division for intelligence which enhances our ability to fight terrorism and working together in the alliance to fight terrorism in an even more effective waybut we agreed today you and i that nato can and must do more in the global fight against terrorism in the fight against terrorism training local forces is one of the best weapons we have nato has the experience the expertise and the staying power to make a real difference and fighting terrorism will be an important topic when nato leaders meet in brussels in maythe other major topic will be fair burdensharing in our alliance and we had a total discussion on this issue today and mr president i thank you for your attention to this issue we are already seeing the effect of your strong focus on the importance of burdensharing in the alliance we agree that allies need to redouble their efforts to meet the pledge we all made in  to invest more in our allianceit is about spending more on defense it is about delivering the capabilities we need and it is about contributing forces to nato missions and operations this means cash capabilities and contributions fair burdensharing has been my top priority since taking office we have now turned a corner in  for the first time in many years we saw an increase in defense spending across european allies and canada  a real increase of  percent or  billion more for our defense we are now working to keep up the momentum including by developing national plans outlining how to make good on what we agreed in  we know that we all need to contribute our fair share because we need to keep our nations safe in a more dangerous worldwe discussed many different topics during our meeting today including the horrendous use of chemical weapons in syria any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable cannot go unanswered and those responsible must be held accountableso mr president thank you once again i look forward to working with you to keeping the alliance strong and i look forward to welcoming you to brussels in may when heads of state and government in the alliance meet there to address the challenges and the need to continue to adapt the alliance to a more challenging security environment and to respond both to the need for fair burdensharing and stepping up our efforts to fight international terrorism so thank you once againthe president thank you very much great thank you so well have a couple of questionsjeff masonq  thank you thank you mr president id like to ask you about two topics if i may first has your view of vladimir putin changed after whats happened in syria and what is the united states prepared to do if he continues to support assadand on a separate question have you made a deal after your chat last night with the president of china about china helping to reign in north korea and is that one reason youve decided not to label beijing a currency manipulatorthe president well ill be speaking to  do you want to go ahead go aheadq  may i for the secretary general do you believe nato should continue to bolster its presence along the alliances eastern border and do you have  are you confident that you have president trump and the united states support for that thank youthe president ill be speaking with rex tillerson in a little while  hes calling in i think he had a very successful meeting in russia well see well see the end result which will be in a long period of time perhaps but the end result is whats most important  not just talk and i think that based on everything im hearing things went pretty well maybe better than anticipated it would be wonderful as we were discussing just a little while ago if nato and our country could get along with russia right now were not getting along with russia at all we may be at an alltime low in terms of a relationship with russia this has built for a long period of time but were going to see what happens putin is the leader of russia russia is a strong country were a very very strong country were going to see how that all works outlast night separately i spoke with a man that ive gotten to know i dont know putin but i do know this gentleman  ive spent a lot of time with him over the last two days and he is the president of china you were there most of you were there and it was quite an interesting period of time president xi wants to do the right thing we had a very good bonding i think we had a very good chemistry together i think he wants to help us with north korea we talked trade we talked a lot of things and i said the way youre going to make a good trade deal is to help us with north korea otherwise were just going to go it alone that will be all right too but going it alone means going it with lots of other nations but i was very impressed with president xi and i think he means well and i think he wants to help well see whether or not he doesq  do you feel like you have a deal with him and if i could just the president excuse meq  do you feel like you have a deal with him in terms of the currency manipulation designation and have your views changed on putinthe president were going to see were going to see about that and ill also see about putin over a period of time it would be a fantastic thing if we got along with putin and if we got along with russia and that could happen and it may not happen it may be just the opposite i can only tell you what i would like to do i would love to be able to get along with everybody right now the world is a mess but i think by the time we finish i think its going to be a lot better place to live and i can tell you that speaking for myself by the time im finished its going to be a lot better place to live in  because right now its nastysecretary general stoltenberg nato is in the process of implementing the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the cold war and one element of that is to increase our military presence in the eastern part of the alliance and we are now deploying four battle groups to the three baltic countries and poland and there have also been more us forces in that part of europe and this is the first time in many many years that we see an increase in the military presence of the united states in europe so we are increasing our presence and were also increasing the readiness and the preparedness of our forces so we can quickly reinforce if neededwe consider the presence we will have when the four battle groups are in place as sufficient given the current security situation in europe but of course we will assess the situation and follow the developments very closelythe message from nato is that what we do is proportionate it is defensive and we dont want a new cold war we dont want a new arms race and actually we strongly believe that there is no contradiction between a strong nato a credible deterrence on defense and political dialogue with russia actually we believe that a precondition for the political dialogue with russia is that we are strong and that we are united but based on that we can talk to russia because russia is our neighbor russia is here to stay so we have to find ways to manage our relationship with russiaand i am absolutely certain that the united states supports this approach  partly because the united states is contributing with forces to our enhanced presence in the eastern part of the alliance and also in the southeast of the alliance in romania and the united states and the president has clearly expressed that they want dialogue with russia but based on unity and strength in the alliancethen the next question is from jon sopelq  thank you very much secretary general how long do you think it will take you to persuade the other european countries to burdenshare and what are you going to do to persuade themmr president could i ask you president trump i like that question laughter q  im here to help laughter and mr president do you think its conceivable whats your instinct  was it possible that syrian forces could have launched that attack in idlib last week without the russians knowing and have you been disappointed surprised by vladimir putins reaction since then thank you very muchpresident trump i think its certainly possible i think its probably unlikely and i know theyre doing investigations into that right now i would like to think that they didnt know but certainly they could have they were there so well find out general mattis is looking into it with the entire pentagon group that does that kind of work so it was very disappointing to see its disappointing no matter who does it but when you get into the gases  especially that form  its vicious and violent and everybody in this room saw it all too many times over the last three or four days  young children dying babies dying fathers holding children in their arms that were dead dead children  there cant be a worse sight and it shouldnt be allowed thats a butcher thats a butcher so i felt we had to do something about it i have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing and it was very very successfully done as you well know thank yousecretary general stoltenberg on defense spending and burdensharing that has been my top priority i have raised it in all my meetings in all capitals i visited with prime ministers presidents ministers of finance and of course also defense and foreign ministers and i expect of course all allies to make good on what they decided back in and the very strong and clear message from president trump has been very helpful so now we see that things are starting to move in the right direction for the first time after many many years of decline in defense spending we now see an increase in defense spending across europe and canada so they have started to move in the right direction   percent real increase in defense spending across europe and canada is a significant step in the right direction its not enough we still have a long way to go but at least they have turned a corner  the european allies have turned a corner instead of reducing defense spending they have started to increase defense spendingthen i think it is important to remember that this something the europeans do because they know that this is in their own security interest it is in their interest to invest more in europe defense because the world has become more dangerous many european allies of course reduced  or all european allies reduced defense spending after the end of the cold war because then tensions went down but if you are decreasing defense spending when tensions are going down then you have to be able to increase the defense spending when tensions are going up and now they are going upso we have still a long way to go but im encouraged by the fact that we have started to move in the right direction and last year there were five allies spending  percent this year romania has declared that they will reach  percent next year latvia and lithuania will also reach  percent so we go from five to eight  which is at least going in the right direction but still we have some work to dopresident trump and i did ask about all the money that hasnt been paid over the years will that money be coming back well be talking about that right laughter we want to talk about that tooanita kumar where are you hi mcclatchyq  mr president whats your reaction to the un inaudible overall can you talk a little bit about your reaction to china  were you aware that was going to happen did president xi talk to you about that and how does that affect your relationshippresident trump we did talk last night i think its wonderful that they abstained as you know very few people expected that and no i was not surprised that china did abstain very very few people thought that that was going to happen so were honored by the vote thats the vote that should have taken placeq  mr secretary general you talked a little bit about moscow about russia how do you inaudible the impression in general theyve been interfering in recent democratic elections  how do you counter moscows secretary general stoltenberg the most important thing is to have a strong alliance to stay united and be firm and predictable in our approach to russia and that means that we have to invest in our collective defense thats exactly what we are doing deploy more troops in the eastern part of the alliance increase the readiness of our forces and increase defense spending and i welcome the very strong message from president trump on the importance of increased defense spendingwe have started to do this so we are implementing the biggest reinforcement of our collective defense since the end of the cold war providing credible deterrence but at the same time we have to find ways to engage with russia to talk with russia because russia will not go away russia will be our biggest neighbor and we have to find ways to live with them and to try to avoid a new cold war a new arms raceand thats exactly why i am very much in favor of what we call the dualtrack approach to russia and as a former norwegian politician i have the experience to work with the russians because norway is bordering russia and norway was able even during the cold war to develop i would call it a pragmatic working relationship with russia cooperating with them on energy on border issues on environment on fishery and also in military affairs and that was not despite our membership in nato but it was because of our membership in nato because nato provided the strength the predictability the platform for a small country to have a political dialogue with russiaso i strongly believe that the only way to deter russia is to be strong but the only way to avoid a new cold war avoid a new arms race and avoid increasing tensions is to continue to engage russia is a political dialogue and to make sure that what we do is defensive and proportionate in response to a more assertive russiaq  thank you mr president im from norway russia is our neighboring country what do you think europe has to fear from russia if this tension continuespresident trump say it q  what do you think that european countries have to fear from russia if this tension continuespresident trump i cannot hear i cannot understand secretary general stoltenberg she asked q  ill do it again what do you think european countries have to fear from russia if this tension continues to escalate and for you mr secretary general the president has said the attack in syria last week was warranted and was also an attack on us allies do you think that this attack was warranted and do you see nato playing any supporting role in future actions in syriapresident trump well i want to just start by saying hopefully theyre going to have to fear nothing ultimately right now there is a fear and there are problems  there are certainly problems but ultimately i hope that there wont be a fear and there wont be problems and the world can get along that would be the ideal situation its crazy whats going on  whether its the middle east or you look at  no matter where the  ukraine  you look at  whatever you look at its got problems so many problems and ultimately i believe that we are going to get rid of most of those problems and there wont be fear of anybody thats the way it should be we have a very big problem in north korea and as i said i really think that china is going to try very hard and has already started a lot of the coal boats have already been turned back  you saw that yesterday and today  theyve been turned back the vast amount of coal that comes out of north korea going to china theyve turned back the boats thats a big step and they have many other steps that i know aboutso well see what happens it may be effective it may not be effective if its not effective we will be effective i can promise you that thank yousecretary general stoltenberg nato has constantly condemned the use of chemical weapons in syria and the use of chemical weapons is horrendous and its a clear violation of international law and any use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and cannot go unanswered so those responsible must be held accountable the strike against the airbase in syria was a us operation based on us intelligence but you have seen that within the alliance this has been something which has been met with a lot of understanding because nato allies do not accept that chemical weapons are used and therefore we also strongly support the efforts of the factfinding commission to try to find out actually what happened and to make sure that we dont see any use of chemical weapons in the futurepresident trump thank you very much thank you end pm edt

secretary wilbur ross secretary elaine chao epa administrator scott pruitt and my budget director mick mulvaney thats an easy job wheres mick laughter such an easy job its the easiest job of anybody in the government  right mickat the top of our agenda is the creation of great highpaying jobs for american workers and weve made a lot of process you see whats going on you see the numbers weve created over  jobs already in a very short period of time and its going to really start catching on now because some of the things that weve done are big league and they are catching onalready weve created more than almost  jobs and yesterday toyota just announced that it will invest more than  billion  its probably going to be  billion  into its georgetown kentucky plant an investment that would not have been made if we didnt win the election we have a lot of work to do in the last two decades our nation has lost a third of its manufacturing jobs and our business tax is one of the highest in the world it actually is of developed countries the single highest tax anywhere in the worldfor too long weve punished production in america and rewarded companies for leaving our country and were going to reverse that we would reward companies give them incentives to leave nafta is a disaster its been a disaster from the day it was devised and were going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on nafta that i can tell youmy administration has already taken historic action to unleash job creation weve signed dozens of bills and executive actions to reduce federal overreach and expand domestic production on the environment were going to be very very careful on the environment its very important to me and the administration but weve allowed a lot of companies to go back to work they were being restricted their jobs were being restricted weve unleashed a lot of companies especially right now in the energy sector  you see whats going on there it was impossible for people to do what they had to do and now they can do it its all done were also working to modernize our economy and harness the full potential of women in the workforce which is crucial to our economic success economic confidence is sweeping the nation you saw the new survey that came out its at   which is the highest its ever been   percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future it was a  percent increase over two months ago when it was also high because of the administration and much higher than its ever been   percent highest its ever beenthis is just the beginning were going to reduce taxes were going to eliminate wasteful regulations which weve already done  probably  percent you can take a look at doddfrank for the bankers in the room theyll be very happy because were really doing a major streamlining and perhaps elimination and replacing it with something else but that will be the minimum but were doing a major elimination of the horrendous doddfrank regulations keeping some obviously but getting rid of many and were going to put many millions of people back to work the banks will be able to lend again so many people come to see me i see them all the time  small businesses  theyre unable to borrow from banks they never had a problem five six seven ten years ago they had great bankers they had great relationships now they cant borrow and were going to let the banks loan them money and they can build their businessesso with your help and insights we will use the private sector innovation to drive job creation and reform government a lot of reform we have a computer system in this country thats  years old so when you hear were hacked and were this that  were like easy targets and one of the things were doing in fact  were working with a very very wonderful woman from ibm and others  and others okay laughter many others its like when i said to lockheed i like the f fighter jet but then i said but i also like the boeing f okay laughter so i love your computers but were also looking at others all rightbut we are were going to have a massive program to modernize our equipment  ideally get brandnew equipment the cost of maintaining our computers is a number that is so high that its not even a believable number now ive heard anywhere  is this possible  from  billion to  billion a year is that even possible thats for keeping our

2017-04-07,"Briefing by Secretary Tillerson, Secretary Mnuchin, and Secretary Ross on President Trump's Meetings with President Xi of China ",tideline resort and spapalm beach florida pm edtmr spicer hi guys so this is being streamed back to both the tideline as well as the white houseobviously today the president was very pleased with the outcomes of todays meeting i wanted to give you guys a quick readout so today ive brought three of the top participants in this secretary of state tillerson secretary of the treasury steven mnuchin and secretary commerce wilbur rosstheyll go in that order and then well take a few questions with that secretary of state tillersonsecretary tillerson well thank you sean i would open by saying the president was very happy to host president xi at maralago these last two days as those of you that have been here know it was obviously a perfect weather day today and it was a great opportunity for both the presidents and their wives to really get to know one another and enjoy share meals together and work on important issueseach side did bring along senior delegations of officials so of course were represented here  who also were able to build important relationships for a lot of work thats still ahead of usi think what i would really want you to get a grasp of is that both the atmosphere the chemistry between the two leaders was positive the posture between the two really set the tone for our subsequent meetings between our highlevel delegations and i would tell you the exchanges were very frank they were candid they were open and they were very positive so i think all of us are feeling very good about the results of this summit in terms of what it did for setting a very constructive tone going forwardthe two leaders had positive productive meetings president trump and president xi agreed to work in concert to expand areas of cooperation while managing differences based on mutual respectthe two presidents reviewed the current state of the bilateral relationship and noted the importance of working together to generate positive outcomes that would benefit the citizens of both of our countries president trump noted the challenges caused by chinese government intervention in its economy and raised serious concerns about the impact of chinas industrial agricultural technology and cyber policies on us jobs and exports the president underscored the need for china to take concrete steps to level the playing field for american workers stressing repeatedly the need for reciprocal market access the two sides noted the urgency of the threat of north koreas weapons program reaffirmed their commitment to a denuclearized korean peninsula and committed to fully implement un security council resolutions they agreed to increase cooperation and work with the international community to convince the dprk to peacefully resolve the issue and abandon its illicit weapons programs the two sides had candid discussions on regional and maritime security president trump noted the importance of adherence to international norms in the east and south china seas and to previous statements on nonmilitarization he also noted the importance of protecting human rights and other values deeply held by americansthe two presidents agreed to elevate existing bilateral talks to reflect the importance of making progress on issues they established a new highlevel framework for negotiations the uschina comprehensive dialogue will be overseen by the two presidents and it will have four pillars the diplomatic and security dialogue the comprehensive economic dialogue the law enforcement and cybersecurity dialogue and the social and cultures issues dialoguethe two sides agreed to undertake an ambitious agenda and schedule to show progress and achieve meaningful results president trump welcomed president xis invitation to visit china for a state visit at a future date they agreed to work together in the interim to ensure successful and resultsfocused visitswith that id like to turn it to treasury secretary mnuchinsecretary mnuchin thank you i would just like to reiterate that we had a very productive two days with our counterparts and specifically we had a meeting this morning that was a breakout of the first comprehensive economic dialogue we had very direct and frank conversations about how we would work together secretary ross and i will be leading that jointly and we will be focused on trade investment and other economic opportunities between both companies  countries we focused specifically on a more balanced economic relationship specifically on trade and we focused on the desire to have very specific action items both in the short term for the next time we get together as well as what the goals are over the year so i think we think the restructuring of the dialogue and having specifically a breakout that will address comprehensive economic opportunities across our different agencies both here and within china i think we felt was very productive very good start in how were going to structure it and again very specific things that we talked about to look forward on making progress in the short term onsecretary rosssecretary ross thank you steven i think in many ways the most significant thing was a day plan normally trade discussions especially between china and ourselves are denominated in multiple years this was denominated in the first instance in  days with hopefully way stations of accomplishment along the way given the range of issues and the magnitude that may be ambitious but its a very big sea change in the pace of discussions and i think thats a very very important symbolization of the growing rapport between the two countriesmr spicer well take a few questions steveq  secretary of state tillerson can i ask you about north korea did the president say that he might use trade against china if they do not rein in north korea and did you  get any specific commitments from china to do something about the north korea problemsecretary tillerson the presidents discussions  president trump and president xi  on north korea were very wideranging very comprehensive and more focused entirely on both countries previous commitments to denuclearize the peninsula there was no kind of a package arrangement discussed to resolve thisi think president xi from their part shared the view that this has reached a very serious stage in terms of the advancement of north koreas nuclear capabilities they discussed the challenges that introduces for both countries but theres a real commitment that we work together to see if this cannot be resolved in a peaceful way but in order for that to happen north koreas posture has to change before theres any basis for dialogue or discussionspresident trump indicated to president xi that he welcomed any ideas that president xi and china might have as to other actions we could take and that we would be happy to work with them but we understand it creates unique problems for them and challenges and that we would and are prepared to chart our own course if this is something china is just unable to coordinate with usq  two quick questions for secretary tillerson and one for secretary ross  previous administrations have been very tough on north korea  sorry  tough on china in terms of human rights violations and i was wondering if that came up and if this administration plans to pressure the chinese on human rights violations and the second question if i may have the opportunity to ask since youre here on syria  a lot of the american people are concerned that yesterdays actions mean were going to war and i was hoping if you could just clarify  is this just a onefit situation or is this going to be part of a  campaign to try to the assad governmentsecretary tillerson as to the discussions around human rights in china i think americas values are quite clear and they really occupied a core of all of our discussions i dont think you have to have a separate conversation somehow separate our core values around human rights from our economic discussions our militarytomilitary discussions or our foreign policy discussions theyre really embedded in every discussion that that is really what guides much of our view around how were going to work togetheras to syria i think as was indicated in our statements last night this particular strike that was carried out on the airbase from which the chemical weapons attack was launched was very deliberately considered by the president it is a response that we believe is both proportional and appropriate and as we said last night we will monitor syrias response to that strike in terms of whether they attack our own forces or coalition forces or whether we detect that they are considering mobilizing to take additional chemical weapons attacks and id say at this point the future will be guided by how we see their reactionq  thank you and for you secretary roth i was wondering if talked to the chinese about cracking down on any banks or companies that may be working with north koreasecretary ross as you know commerce fined zte the second largest telecom company for making equipment in china  billion recently so they recognize that that shows our clear determination to crack down on that sort of activitysecretary mnuchin and i would just also emphasize treasury obviously manages multiple sanctions programs some specifically towards north korea and we have had direct conversations with our counterparts in china about working with us on thoseq  did the chinese agree to do anything that will make it easier for american companies to export to chinasecretary mnuchin i think there was definitely an acknowledgement by them on the trade issue that we do need to get to a more balanced trade environment we did begin those discussions today but i would just emphasize there was a lot going on in two days and although we had some specific conversations as secretary ross mentioned the plan is for us to develop a day plan and we would expect to see some very specific items on thatq  will you move forward with a plan to label china a currency manipulatorsecretary mnuchin i would just comment on i think as you know the currency report is going to come out in the near future and we will address that when it comes outsecretary ross as other trade issues you would not have expected us to reach agreement in a few hours of meetings the issues are far more complex and far more deep rooted but days is a very very short time for tradeq  did you discuss the environment and environmental commitments and what was your response if china asked for more commitments from the united states on that issuesecretary ross that was not a major part of the discussion nor do i recall the chinese specifically raising itq  there was anticipation that president xi would come with some sort of gift for president trump  infrastructure investment something that would demonstrate a chinese commitment to having more jobs in the us was there anything like thatsecretary ross the best gift was his presence and the relationship what was built up between our president and president xi q  secretary tillerson chinese media is reporting that president trump was invited to visit china in  can you clarify just if that was the year that youve agreed to do thissecretary tillerson the president did accept the invitation of president xi to visit china now the invitation was for a  visit the president said that he would look at the dates and we would work with them to see when that visit might occurq  secretary ross could you give a couple of examples of the kind of way stations that people might see in the day timesecretary ross the exact way stations are a matter of negotiation itself but directionally the objective is to increase our exports to china and to reduce the trade deficit that we have with themq  when you say that there was a recognition by the chinese and acknowledgement of the trade issue that it needs to be a more balanced environment what did they say exactly that seems like thats sort of off message for themsecretary mnuchin i dont think it was off message at all again i think they look at  we have very similar economic interests and i think there are areas that they clearly want to work with us and as secretary ross said the objective is for us to increase our exports to them its a very big market and there will be more opportunities for both exports as well as investmentsq  we were told  sorry did you want to say something secretary rosssecretary ross what i was going to say was simply that it was a very wide range of products that we discussed not a particularly limited one and the most interesting thing to me was they expressed an interest in reducing their net trade balance because of the impact its having on money supply and inflation thats the first time ive heard them say that in a bilateral contextq  we were informed that president xi was informed of the syria strikes during dinner yesterday and so i was wondering if you could maybe explain what the reaction was from the chinese as to this theyve usually been very opposed  in the un at least  on acts against syria and so since the three of you are here we saw that all three of you were in the photo in the situation room as this was playing out so id be very interested to hear  especially its not common to see maybe the treasury secretary or the commerce secretary in those situations so if you can say what role you were playing and maybe what your thoughts were while this was unfoldingsecretary tillerson the president did directly inform president xi near the end of the dinner yesterday evening as the missiles that are launched were impacting which was about  pm last night the president told president xi that we had launched a strike against syria as a result of assads violation  multiple violations of the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens including the killing of women children and babies the president provided president xi the number of missiles that were launched and explained the rationale behind itpresident xi i think expressed an appreciation for the president letting him know and providing the rationale and said as it was told to me indicated that he understood that such a response is necessary when people are killing childrennow china has issued its own statements im sure those are available to you i have read them on them on the wire service as wellas to the situation room before i turn it to the two secretaries to give you kind of their color on what was going on i think it is important for everyone to recognize a couple of things on the syrian attack first it was an overwhelming success i think the performance our military and the expertise and the power of what the us military is able to execute on a fairly short planning window was extraordinary and i think all americans and indeed i think all our allies in the free world should take great comfort in what occurred with that strike last night and americans should be very proud of their men and women in uniformsecretary mnuchin i would just not only echo what secretary tillerson said but i think as you know the treasury department has very important functions in terms of sanctions and other intelligence  financial intelligence functions that i have been participating in so on the national security council the treasury department does participate in that we will be announcing additional sanctions on syria as part of our ongoing effort to stop this type of activity and emphasize how significant we view this and we expect that those will continue to have an important effect on preventing people from doing business with themq  can you elaborate on the sanctions a little bitsecretary mnuchin again they will be coming out in the near future but i would just say we view sanctions as being a very important tool whether its north korea or whether its syria these sanctions are very important and we will use them to the maximum effectsecretary ross to me the most dramatic thing about being in the situation room as he was making the decision was the thoroughness of the support and information that went into it the consultation he did with a wide range of military and diplomatic and economic advisors and the utter seriousness and thoughtfulness with which he made this very grave decisionin terms of the strikes themselves its my understanding that they took out something like  percent of the entire syrian air force so it was huge not just in terms of number of planes but relative to the scale of their air forceq  secretary tillerson you talked about the great success the afp is reporting that the runway is still operational and is actually being used is that accurate and can you comment on whether that was your intent and if that puts a damper on the success of the operationsecretary tillerson the runways were not the target due to the nature of the construction of those runways our military estimate was that we could not do serious damage to the runways they are very thick and theyre constructed in a way that the ordnance that were used while would have damaged them  the damage would have been easily repaired in a matter of hoursso the targeting was selected very deliberately to render the airbase essentially inoperable as an operating base and that means taking out all the infrastructure the fueling capability all the support infrastructure hangars and indeed there were a number of syrian aircraft that were destroyed on the ground those were the targets that were selected for that very specific reasonso the fact that planes may be landing in and out of there theyre not refueling and theyre not able to certainly initiate any activity from that airfield todayq  can i also ask you a followup on reports that the united states is investigating russias role in the gas attacks themselves how far are you in this investigation and whats your confidence level and the direction on that pleasesecretary tillerson i dont have any particular information i think that it would be appropriate to share with you at this point obviously we continue to gather the information that we can through our intelligence sources as well as shared sources from other countries as well and so i dont think it would be appropriate for me to comment on that at this timeq  russia has come out very strongly against the attack calling it an act of aggression do you have a message for the russians or a response to thatsecretary tillerson im disappointed in that response from the russians because it indicates their continued support for the assad regime and in particular their continued support for a regime that carries out these type of horrendous attacks on their own people so i find it very disappointing but sadly i have to tell you not all that surprisingq  there were reports prior to today that president trump was planning to sign an executive order that would target countries that dump steel into the united states was that correct and is he still planning to do so if sosecretary ross the practice is to announce executive orders and executive memoranda when theyre issued not in response to rumors q  can you just if westinghouse was talked about at all and the scale of the bankruptcy of westinghouse  was that even a topicsecretary ross that was not a topic in todays session but we have been looking very carefully at that and the alternatives both from an economic from an energy generation and from a national security point of view secretary mnuchin and i would just comment that it  obviously any such transaction that involved foreign investment would go through the normal cfius process thank youmr spicer thank you guys very much have a great weekendend pm edt ,20656.099609,1.919922000000952,9.294697626092143e-05,5877.810059,3.1201169999994818,0.0005308298445646458,2355.540039,1.6198730000000978,0.0006876864639022584

2017-04-07,Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer ,tideline ocean resort and spapalm beach florida pm edtmr spicer well talk about individual stuff afterwards but right now i want to make sure that the president has an opportunity to  his words and his audioq  its off cameramr spicer its off off everything is offq  turn it offmr spicer ive got a michael anton here from the national security committee i think with respect to president xs visit we intend to have a readout later hopefully we can  well gather with the pool at the very least well see what the rest of the day looks like  trying to get back over here as well but well continue to update thati just wanted to provide a little bit of a ticktock on the presidents action i know theres been a lot of interest in this and then we can take a few questions but with respect to the actions the president took in syria and the questions regarding the timeline let me just kind of walk you through iton tuesday at about  am in the morning the president was informed during the course of his daily presidential briefing about the actions in syria he at that time asked the team for additional information and updates the interagency team spent the day developing an initial range of options for the president at about  pm on tuesday night there was a restricted deputy committee meeting on the situation preliminary options were presented and refinedq  sean can you talk louder pleasemr spicer im sorry on tuesday night there was additional  there was a deputies meeting at the white house where options were presented and refined and interagency guidance was developed wednesday morning a restricted principals meeting was conducted with interagency options and gave further guidance to refine around  pm on wednesday a national security meeting was convened where the president was briefed on options he reviewed the options in detail asked a series of questions to his team requested further information and the decision to reconvene on thursday was madeat about  pm on thursday en route to florida the president convened the national security team that was aboard air force one and others via secure videoconference on air force one later that day at approximately  pm the president the secretary of state secretary of defense national security advisor and other members of the national security team met in a secure room down here where they were piped in with the rest of the team via secure videoteleconference the president gave the okay to move aheadat approximately  pm tomahawk missiles were launched from navy destroyers in the eastern mediterranean q  what time was thatmr spicer  pm   eastern from navy destroyers in the eastern mediterranean all  hit their target at  pm notification of foreign leaders and congressional leadership began the vice president called several congressional leaders and began calling some foreign leaders the secretary of state secretary of defense national security advisor and others were also involved in making some of those phone calls to both heads of government defense ministers and congressional leadersaround  pm the first impacts began on the ground the president informed president xi that strikes were occurring as their dinner concluded all along the national security team continued to monitor the event and the situationsafter dinner the president went back down to the secure room where he was briefed by the secretary of state secretary of defense chairman of the joint chiefs and others were present via secure videoteleconference in the situation room the secretary of defense was on a secure line videoteleconference as well as the chairman of the joint chiefs  several other members were convened in the situation room in washington dcthe president was updated on the effectiveness was informed that battle damage assessment would take a few hours but that initial results were extremely positive he asked about reaction from the world community as well as congressional leaders and was informed that there was fairly unanimous praise for the decision and the actions the president tookthats pretty much the ticktock pentagon and national security team continue to provide the president with updates this morning and as soon as his visit with president xi  i expect a further update to the presidenthallieq  sean inaudible in syria  is this a oneoff is it a change from the administrations policy moving forward what happens mr spicer im not going to get  youve heard the president talk  he spoke  he said something in the rose garden the other day with king abdullah there that hes not going to telegraph his next move but i think that this action was very decisive justified and proportional to the actions that he felt needed taken i think it sends a very strong signal not just to syria but throughout the worldq  how does this fit with america first foreign policy is that still his stated positionmr spicer absolutely i think that his actions were very clear under article  in our nations national security theres very important national security interests in the region stability and obviously theres a huge humanitarian component to thisjulieq  general mcmaster was briefing last night that the president  the three options can you give us mr spicer noq   what the three options weremr spicer i cantq  can you talk about the process that the president went through when he got the three options who he consulted with and then what his recommendation to go forward mr spicer again im not going to get into specifics theres obviously both in terms of what could have been done but obviously that would telegraph potential future action that i dont want to get into and a lot of that remains classified i will say however that as i mentioned both secretary of defense mattis chairman of the joint chiefs of staff director mcmaster and the rest of the national security team  the vice president and others  were consulted and that occurred over  starting on tuesday at  am when the president was made aware of this he continued to ask questions and ask for options so this was a very evolving process in which the president was given updates asked additional questions given additional options refined those options until an ultimate decision was made yesterdaymargaretq  can you just clarify  i think you said that the president informed xi after the strikes had concluded is that accuratemr spicer the exact timeline  the president as you know yesterday was having dinner i think after the dinner concluded i believe that the impact had been made id have to check the exact timeline but the impact occurred at around  pm last night eastern time the president informed president xi as dinner concluded and he was on his way back to his temporary quarters so where the exact timeline is i dont know but my understanding is is that everything had made impact by the time he was informed  he informed president xiq   because clearly the president has said that north korea is of deep concern mr spicer thats rightq  this is a military action that was taken unilaterally how did he explain this to xi jinping was it put that in that context was there any broader message that look if you dont help us crack down on north korea we are willing to go ahead with similar actionmr spicer im going to let  there will be a readout later today about all the areas and issues that were discussed and i think well try to get some further  some individuals to actually talk about specifics on the topics that were talked  i believe that what the president stated last night was just simply that action had been taken what he was doing what had happened and that he was going to be briefed i dont think there was any immediate nexus but i was not present for that conversationq  sean just to clarify and follow up hr mcmaster said last night i believe that there were two nsc meetings i believe you described more meetings than that how many meetings was the president personally involved in throughout this processmr spicer four that were  four q  four okaymr spicer well again you remember it started with the pdb i mean it depends q  so fivemr spicer then five yeah if you count the initial pdb that was at  am on tuesdayq  okay and secondly i know you say the president says hes not going to outline what hes going to do next he wants to remain flexible but members on the hill say that they want to be brought into the process so how does that match the president keeping his desire of not announcing things but folks on the hill saying hey we need to be brought inmr spicer i would just say blake  i mean as i mentioned the key congressional leaders and committee heads and ranking members were all informed of the decision i think now that action has been taken i believe that theyll be  theyve started to have those conversations both the secretary of defense the secretary of state national security advisor the vice president the chief of staff others have been in constant with contact with congressional leaders and i understand your desire to understand whats going on but i think those are conversations that are going to be held fairly privately in terms of preserving any future actionjimq  theres some reports out there that there are concerns among us officials that the russians were involved in the chemical weapons attack that occurred in syria whats the latest on that what can you tell us about that mr spicer the actions that were taken were clearly against the assad regime and im not going to say anything further than that as i mentioned  i know secretary tillerson noted last night with respect to russia that there was a military deconfliction with respect to the area of operation to make sure that  because were both operating but beyond that there was no political contact made with moscow but i think last night sent a very clear signalq  sean you talk about this as evolution over these last  hours can you give a little bit of insight into the presidents thinking and how that evolved we saw publicly the statements that he made where he sort of seemed to become more taken aback by the imagery or what have you by the time he gave that press conference did you talk to him privately about what his reaction was in the beginning and then how that evolved and how he got from point a to point b to launch the strikemr spicer well only to say  i mean number one i think the presidents comments that he made in the rose garden with king abdullah pretty much speak for themselves with respect to the disgust that he had for the imagery that he was seeing and the assessments that his team was providing with respect to the innocent lives especially the children and babies that have been killedobviously chemicals have been used by assad in the past in his first  days the president was very taken by this but also i think this was  as you mentioned correctly this was a hour evolution of receiving updates and options and refinement through additional questions that the president made to come to a final decisionbut once he was presented with these at  am on tuesday he began to ask a series of questions began to get additional updates and assessment as far as what happened why it happened and then obviously options that were available and to actq  but the question is was there a sense of the skepticism at the beginning where he said look are you sure that mr spicer no no i spoke with him i had an opportunity to see him initially right after that pdb and he was very moved and found the event extremely tragic so i think from the getgo it was very very disturbing and tragic and moving to himq  so you had a sense that he was there in terms of military strength mr spicer no i wouldnt say  no again i wouldnt  just before we get too far the answer is that he had a very deliberative process of asking his national security team to develop options and as you may know i mean those options usually start with zero and go all the way to  and so there was a level of assessment further probing and questions that the president had and then ultimately after days of refinement a decision was made but that  i wouldnt want to suggest that there was any sense of immediate decision thats why it evolved over time and he took the length of time that he did it was through a series of updates questions and further informationq  how did he seem seanmr spicer im sorryq  what did he see what did he seem in that pdb did he see printedout images did he see videomr spicer obviously i cant go into what he sees in a pbdq  okay but how did he take in mr spicer obviously theres  beyond the information that he gets in his pbd there were very clear images that were available online in newspapers and on television that everyone in the world could seeq  and was he seeing those picturesmr spicer im sorryq  he was seeing those too the public images that were out theremr spicer oh absolutely q  as far as this hour evolution does the president now believe assad needs to leave powermr spicer i think that the presidents actions were very decisive last night and i think are very clear about what he thinks needs to get done i think first and foremost the president believes that the syrian government the assad regime should at the minimum agree to abide by the agreements that they made not to use chemical weapons i think that should be a minimum standard throughout the worldso i think thats where we start i think a very very clear message was sent last night one that was backed up and echoed by not only our own leaders here in this country but throughout the worldq  sean the president during the campaign warned that action against the assad regime could result or devolve into world war iii he talked about the risks of drawing in russia and iran into a broader conflict is the president at all concerned about that happening or the fact that as us planes fly over the syrian skies that they could run into interference from either russian or syrian defense systemsmr spicer i think if youve seen the response from the world community including some of the countries that youve mentioned i think that they understand that the us acted appropriately and in most cases there is widespread praise from around the globe for the presidents actionsq  but is that not something that hes concerned about anymoremr spicer i think the president  as i said the team last night  secretary of defense mattis secretary of state tillerson the vice president the chief of staff national security advisor was on the phone not just with members of congress but with foreign heads of government as well as defense ministers and almost universally were praised for the presidents decisive actionq  to follow on that sean also on the campaign trail the president expressed a desire to work with russia to defeat isis but this clearly puts a setback on thatmr spicer i dont know that i agree with that i think that there can be a shared commitment to defeat isis and also agree that you cant gas your own people i dont think that  there is a mutual level of human decency that i think we can expect out of everybody and i dont think that that goes hand in hand with also augmenting that with our national security interestsq  sean can you give us a sense of what foreign ministers and defense ministers were spoken to last night and will the president  inaudiblemr spicer the president has been continuing in meetings with president xi ill see on both of those whether or not q  one more thing the russian foreign ministry statement this morning called this a clear act of aggression suggested that the united states had been planning this strike even before the chemical attack can you respond specificallymr spicer i think i just gave you a very clear ticktock of what  the presidents notification how he arrived at the action he did so that pretty much speaks for itself and im sorry the other q  that this is a clear act of aggressionmr spicer i think this was a clear response on humanitarian purposes that has been widely praised throughout the globe q  are there any specific outcomes that you see from president xi visitmr spicer as i mentioned at the outset well have a readout of that visit i just wanted to give you guys a quick update well have further information throughout the day stay in touch with us i want to get back obviously our focus is continuing to have a phenomenal  a great  im sorry politico  laughter  i think were in the midst of a very terrific visit and i want to make sure that we conclude thatthank you guys very muchend pm edt

2017-04-06,"Press Briefing by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and National Security Advisor General H.R. McMaster, 4/6/2017 ",tideline ocean resort  spapalm beach florida pm edtmr spicer tonight secretary tillerson and nsa director lieutenant general mcmaster will both give comments regarding the presidents order tonight and then afterwards well take a few questions and then let you get to some sleepwith that secretary tillersonsecretary tillerson good evening all i think what we want to try to do is give you a little bit of background on how we got to the statements by the president and the actions that were taken tonight as youre well aware bashar alassad has carried out chemical attacks this past week on civilians including women and children and carried out attacks earlier  last month march th and th in homs province as well we have a very high level of confidence that the attacks were carried out by aircraft under the direction of bashar alassads regime and we also have very high confidence that the attacks involved the use of sarin nerve gas at least the past three attacks were fairly high  we have high confidence on thati think its also clear that previous agreements that had been entered into pursuant to un security council resolution  as well as annex a agreements that the syrian government themselves accepted back in  whereby they would surrender their chemical weapons under the supervision of the russian government now the us and the russian government entered into agreements whereby russia would locate these weapons they would secure the weapons they would destroy the weapons and that they would act as the guarantor that these weapons would no longer be present in syriaclearly russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from  so either russia has been complicit or russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreementi think the other thing thats important to recognize  that as assad has continued to use chemical weapons in these attacks with no response  no response from the international community  that he in effect is normalizing the use of chemical weapons which then may be adopted by others so its important that some action be taken on behalf of the international community to make clear that these chemical weapons continue to be a violation of international normsi think its also important to recognize as i think everyone does the chaotic circumstances that exist on the ground in syria with the presence of a battle underway to defeat isis the presence of al qaeda elements inside of syria and a civil war that is underway so clearly one of the existential threats we see on the ground in syria is if there are weapons of this nature available in syria the ability to secure those weapons and not have them fall into the hands of those who would bring those weapons to our shores to harm american citizensso there are a number of elements that in our view called for this action and which we feel was appropriate we feel the strike itself was proportional because it was targeted at the facility that delivered this most recent chemical weapons attack and in carrying this out we coordinated very carefully with our international partners in terms of communicating with them around the world and i will tell you that the response from our allies in europe as well as the region in the middle east has been overwhelmingly supportive of the action weve takenso ill leave it there and let me turn it to nsa director mcmastergeneral mcmaster i really have very little to add except to say that it was important during the presidents deliberations and its deliberations with his leadership that we weighed of course the risk associated with any military action and we weighed that against the risk of inaction which secretary tillerson has already really summarized which is the risk of this continued egregious inhumane attacks on innocent civilians with chemical weapons and so really nothing else to add to the secretarys summary and were happy to take any questions that you haveq  could you go through just the timeline of how the presidents thinking changed and when did you present him with options and so forthgeneral mcmaster okay so the president was immediately notified upon news of the chemical attack and he was very interested in understanding better the circumstances of the attack and who was responsible our intelligence community in cooperation with our friends and partners and allies around the world collaborated to determine with a very high degree of confidence precisely where the location originated and then of course the sort of chemicals that were used in the attackthat confidence level has just continued to grow in the hours and days since the attack associated with additional evidence thats available especially  so sad  sadly from the victims that are being treated and the confirmation of the type of agent that was used which was a nerve agentso that was  the initial interactions with the president were about the attack and responding to his questions about the nature of the attack the scope of the attack and who was responsible in particularand then we convened a meeting of the national security council principals  a small group it wasnt the full  it was almost the full national security council  to deliberate on options there were three options you can imagine which those were there were three options that we discussed with the president and the president asked us to focus on two options in particular to mature those options and then he had a series of questions for us that we endeavored to answerwe were able to answer those questions and come back to him in a decision  briefing today again with virtually all of the principals on the national security council here in florida and then by videotelephone conference back in washington and after a meeting of considerable length and a farreaching discussion the president decided to act and thats the general sequence of events so rather two large and formal meetings but really a whole series of discussions since the time of the attacksecretary do you have anything to add to thatsecretary tillerson no i think just as i said as i think hr has said this was a very deliberative process there was a thorough examination of a wide range of options and i think the president made the correct choice and made the correct decision first to be decisive in acting  acting against this heinous act on the part of bashar alassad  but acting in a way that was clearly directed at the source of this particular attack to send that strong messageother things were considered those were rejected for any number of reasons and in my view the president made the exact correct decisionq  mr secretary q  mr secretary can you talk a little bit about your discussions in the last hour secretary did you speak to the president secretary tillerson ill let sean referee heremr spicer laughter im good at it hallie q  did you or did the president speak with president putin prior to the attack can you talk about the discussions that you had with moscow and what the expectation is from themand then general mcmaster i have a question for you as well pleasesecretary tillerson there were no discussions or prior contacts nor have there been any since the attack with moscowq  and can you tell us about your expectations for what you think you will hear from president putin or foreign minister lavrovsecretary tillerson ill let them speak for themselvesq  general mcmaster id like to ask you  the president  you talked a little bit in response to steves question about the presidents evolution of his thinking just a couple of years ago his encouragement was to stay out of syria you talked about the images that sort of moved him into this direction  as he put it tonight beautiful babies cruelly murdered has his thinking then changed on allowing syrian refugees into the united states to your knowledgegeneral mcmaster no that wasnt discussed as any part of the deliberationsq  and on the target anything else on specifically what you believe was destroyed in the strikegeneral mcmaster ill defer to the pentagon on that but there were a number of targets that were associated with the ability of that airfield to operate and to continue massmurder attacks against the syrian civilians and the one thing that i will tell you though there was an effort to minimize risk to thirdcountry nationals at that airport  i think you read russians from that  and we took great pains to try to avoid that of course in any kind of military operation there are no guarantees and then there were also measures put in place to avoid hitting what we believe is a storage of sarin gas there so that that would not be ignited and cause a hazard to civilians or anyone elsemr spicer margaretq  can i ask hr  sorry  both the secretary and hr mcmaster  what is the overriding message here is it that  this is not clearly a declaration of war but is it that for president trump and this administration the credible threat of military force is back on the table was this articulated or explained in any way to president xi prior to the presidents remarks and do you see this as in any way sending a message more broadly on your policy towards north korea that the president is willing to take decisive action if both of you would weigh insecretary tillerson well i think as you just stated this clearly indicates the president is willing to take decisive action when called for and i think in this particular case the use of prohibited chemical weapons which violates a number of international norms and violates existing agreements called for this type of a response which is a kinetic military response i would not in any way attempt to extrapolate that to a change in our policy or our posture relative to our military activities in syria today theres been no change in that status but i think it does demonstrate that president trump is willing to act when governments and actors cross the line and cross the line on violating commitments they have made and cross the line in the most heinous of ways i think it is clear that president trump has made that statement to the world tonightq  mr secretary can i mr spicer hold on hold on general mcmaster i really have no further comment on that question i think the secretary covered it comprehensivelyseanq  did you tell china in advancemr spicer hold on one secondq  mr secretary if i could ask you to clarify russia again  you said no contacts were made with russia before the strikes todaysecretary tillerson no contacts were made with moscow with president putin there are military deconfliction agreements in place with the russian military and our military did operate under and in accordance with those deconfliction agreements in coordinating this particular attackq  on the ground in syriasecretary tillerson in syriaq  can you explain mr secretary that process how was russia notified secretary tillerson let me let hr general mcmaster there are normal channels open for deconfliction and ill just defer that to the pentagon just for accuracy but the pentagon i know is going to be talking to the press here soon and i think it would be better if they give you a more precise answer if youre looking for detailsq  and mr secretary if i could obviously the diplomatic considerations here are of a magnitude that didnt exist a number of years ago when you went into this unlike president obama who was dealing simply with bashar alassad youre dealing with russia youre dealing with the kurds youre dealing with turkey can you give us a little bit of the diplomatic calculation in undertaking this attacksecretary tillerson well my expectation is that all of those parties with the exception of bashar alassad and perhaps russia i think are going to applaud this particular action or effort overall the situation in syria is one where our approach today and our policy today is first to defeat isis by defeating isis we remove one of the disruptive elements in syria that exists today that begins to clarify for us opposition forces and regime forces in working with the coalition  as you know there is a large coalition of international players and allies who are involved in the future resolution in syria so its to defeat isis its to begin to stabilize areas of syria stabilize areas in the south of syria stabilize areas around raqqa through ceasefire agreements between the syrian regime forces and opposition forces stabilize those areas begin to restore some normalcy to them restore them to local governance  and there are local leaders who are ready to return some who have left as refugees  theyre ready to return to govern these areas use local forces that will be part of the liberation effort to develop the local security forces  law enforcement police force and then use other forces to create outer perimeters of security so that areas like raqqa areas in the south can begin to provide a secure environment so refugees can begin to go home and begin the rebuilding processin the midst of that through the geneva process we will start a political process to resolve syrias future in terms of its governance structure and that ultimately in our view will lead to a resolution of bashar alassads departure mr spicer jonathanq  mr secretary and general mcmaster does this strike significantly change assads military capability to carry out an attack like this or was it really about sending a message that this kind of attack is not acceptablesecretary tillerson well ill answer the last part of that this was clearly a very decisive action taken on the part of president trump who i think you heard yesterday said this particular heinous attack changed his view of how horrible these types of use of these weapons are that clearly changed president trumps view that something has to be done in responseill let hr mcmaster respond to the second question of the military  whether its changed our military posturegeneral mcmaster obviously the regime will maintain the certain capacity to commit mass murder with chemical weapons we think beyond this particular airfield but it was aimed at this particular airfield for a reason because we could trace this murderous attack back to that facility and this was not a small strike it was not a small strike and i think what it does communicate is a big shift right a big shift in assads calculus  it should be anyway  because this is the first time that the united states has taken direct military action against that regime or the regime of his fatherso i think what is critical is the presidents decision in response to this mass murder attack but also in the context of all the previous attacks that have occurred  i think over   i think its over  chemical attacks previously post when the un resolution went into effect and so i think that its both it was aimed at the capacity to commit mass murder with chemical weapons but it was not of a scope or a scale that it would go after all such related facilitiesq  were military personnel with any other nations any of our allies take part in this or was this  percent a us operationsecretary tillerson this was entirely a us operationmr spicer jenq  can you talk a little bit about whether there might have been just an emotional reaction to this from president trump assad cannot gas americans so do you think some emotional response to the sight and images of what happened in syria played into this and secondly can you talk about the reaction from president xisecretary tillerson no i dont think it was  i do not view it as an emotional reaction at all i think as president trump evaluated this first attack these attacks that occurred on his watch and reflected upon the prior responses or lack of responses he came to the conclusion that we could not yet again turn away and turn an eye  turn a blind eye to whats happenedthe use of these weapons as i indicated earlier one of the concerns we have is the more we fail to respond to use of these weapons the more we begin to normalize their use and when we begin to normalize their use we are opening up widerspread use by others who would use such weaponsand i dont think we should in any way diminish the risk of the situation in syria where there is a lot of chaos on the ground there are elements on the ground in syria elements that are plotting to reach our shore and these type of weapons falling into their hands and being brought to our shore is a direct threat on the american peopleq  sorry i wanted to ask you to clarify something secretary tillerson first and then i also have a military question you were saying that there was no coordination with moscow for this but then you said that you followed the rules of deconfliction so that kind of suggests that you did talk to russia in some capacity can you just clarify thatsecretary tillerson well i think director mcmaster answered it and again i would direct you to the pentagon to give you the precise procedures that are followed but these are battlefield agreements because were operating in syria the russians are operating in syria as we have begun the march to defeat isis many of our forces are becoming more approximate to one another and so we have a deconfliction agreement in place with the russian militaryand so there are command contacts that exist  for any type of operation that could bring us into conflict thats the level of contact that were talking aboutq  so is it more accurate to say that you didnt seek approval from moscow or anything like that for them to kind of give you the green light but you followed protocol in terms of the military secretary tillerson we sought no approval from moscow or at any other level within the russian infrastructure this was strictly following the rules that we have put in place an agreement with the russian military to deconflict because our target in this attack was not russia it was not the russians it was not their forces nor any russian individuals our target was this airfield and the syrian regime general mcmaster i would just add one thing the purpose was not to receive permission the purpose was to reduce the chances of russian casualties and to follow the procedures as you mentioned but we wanted to take every possible measure we could to reduce the chance of russian casualtiesmr spicer thank you guys very much appreciate it were going to have a great nightend pm edt

supplements the office of management and budget omb interim guidance issued on february   titled interim guidance implementing section  of the eo of january   titled reducing regulation and controlling regulatory costs while ombs office of information and regulatory affairs oira believes this guidance largely treats the subjects covered in the february   interim guidance in a consistent manner where these two memoranda are in conflict this guidance supersedes the previous guidance it reflects oiras consideration of the comments received in response to the february   interim guidance comments sent by members of the public are available on regulationsgov in docket id ombii     general requirementsthe guidance explains for purposes of implementing section  the following requirementsunless prohibited by law whenever an executive department or agency    publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation it shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed sec  afor fiscal year     the heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations including repealed regulations to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero unless otherwise required by law or consistent with advice provided in writing by the director of the office of management and budget     sec  bin furtherance of the requirement of subsection a of this section any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall to the extent permitted by law be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations sec  cin general executive departments or agencies agencies may comply with those requirements by issuing two eo  deregulatory actions described below for each eo  regulatory action described below the incremental costs associated with eo  regulatory actions must be fully offset by the savings of eo  deregulatory actionsin addition agencies planning to issue one or more eo  regulatory actions on or before september   should for each such eo  regulatory actionidentify two existing regulatory actions the agency plans to eliminate or propose for elimination on or before september   in a reasonable period of time before the agency issues the eo  regulatory action andfully offset the total incremental cost of such eo  regulatory action as of september  guidance on the requirements of section a is forthcomingbeginning with fy  section d requires the director of omb to identify to agencies a total amount of incremental costs or regulatory cap as stated in section  for all eo  deregulatory and eo  regulatory actions finalized during the fiscal year the total incremental cost imposed by each agency should not exceed the agencys allowance for that fiscal year unless required by law or approved by the director the total incremental cost allowance may be an increase or reduction in total regulatory cost and will be informed by agencies draft submissions for the regulatory planplease consult with oira if you have any particular questions regarding the applicability or interpretation of eo  not addressed in these qasagencies should continue to comply with all applicable laws and requirements in addition eo  remains the primary governing eo regarding regulatory planning and review accordingly among other requirements except where prohibited by law agencies must continue to assess and consider both the benefits and costs of regulatory actions including deregulatory actions when making regulatory decisions and issue regulations only upon a reasoned determination that benefits justify costsiii      definitionsthis section provides definitions for terms used in this guidance the definitions should not necessarily be applied to other sections of eo  that this guidance does not cover and do not replace definitions used in other eos or statutesqwhat is an agencya an agency unless otherwise indicated means any authority of the united states that is an agency under  usc  other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies as defined in  usc  a cabinet department is considered a single agency for purposes of eo  complianceqwhat is an eo  regulatory actiona an eo  regulatory action isa significant regulatory action as defined in section f of eo  that has been finalized and that imposes total costs greater than zero ora significant guidance document eg significant interpretive guidance reviewed by oira under the procedures of eo  that has been finalized and that imposes total costs greater than zerofor example eo  regulatory actions include negotiated rulemakings that are significant as defined in section f of eo  that have been finalized and that impose total costs greater than zeroq what is a significant guidance documenta as defined in ombs final bulletin for agency good guidance practices  a significant guidance document is a guidance document disseminated to regulated entities or the general public that may reasonably be anticipated tolead to an annual effect on the economy of  million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy a sector of the economy productivity competition jobs the environment public health or safety or state local or tribal governments or communitiescreate a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agencymaterially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements grants user fees or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof orraise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates the presidents priorities or the principles set forth in eo  as further amendeda significant guidance document does not include legal advisory opinions for internal executive branch use and not for release such as department of justice office of legal counsel opinions briefs and other positions taken by agencies in investigations prelitigation litigation or other enforcement proceedings speeches editorials media interviews press materials congressional correspondence guidance documents that pertain to a military or foreign affairs function of the united states other than guidance on procurement or the import or export of nondefense articles and services grant solicitations warning letters case or investigatory letters responding to complaints involving factspecific determinations purely internal agency policies guidance documents that pertain to the use operation or control of a government facility internal guidance documents directed solely to other federal agencies and any other category of significant guidance documents exempted by an agency in consultation and concurrence with the oira administrator in the list above internal policies and guidance documents do not include those that materially affect an agencys interactions with nonfederal entities even if nominally directed only to agency personnel for example an internal directive to field staff on how to implement a regulatory requirement could be a significant guidance document if it satisfied any of i through iv aboveif they satisfy the definition above modifications to existing guidance and interpretative documents would be considered significant guidance documentsq what is an eo  deregulatory actiona an eo  deregulatory action is an action that has been finalized and has total costs less than zero an eo  deregulatory action qualifies as both  one of the actions used to satisfy the provision to repeal or revise at least two existing regulations for each regulation issued and  a cost savings for purposes of the total incremental cost allowance eo  deregulatory actions are not limited to those defined as significant under eo  or ombs final bulletin on good guidance practicesan eo  deregulatory action may be issued in the form of an action in a wide range of categories of actions including but not limited toinformal formal and negotiated rulemakingguidance and interpretative documentssome actions related to international regulatory cooperation andinformation collection requests that repeal or streamline recordkeeping reporting or disclosure requirementssignificant proposed rules issued before noon on january   that are formally withdrawn by notice in the federal register and removed from the unified agenda of regulatory and deregulatory actions may qualify as repeal actions but do not qualify for cost savingsplease consult with oira regarding other actions your agency believes should qualify as an eo  deregulatory actionq what does offset meana the term offset means at least two eo  deregulatory actions have been taken per eo  regulatory action and that the incremental cost of the eo  regulatory action has been appropriately counterbalanced by incremental cost savings from eo  deregulatory actions consistent with the agencys total incremental cost allowanceqwhat is a statutorily or judicially required rulemakinga a statutorily required rulemaking is one for which congress has provided by statute an explicit requirement and explicit timeframe for rulemaking for example a statute that states an agency shall issue nutrition labeling requirements within  years of the statutes enactment date would be considered a statutorily required rulea judicially required rulemaking is one for which there is a judicially established binding deadline for rulemaking including deadlines established by settlement agreement or consent decreeagencies should consult with oira to determine whether a rule falls within the definition of a statutorily or judicially required rulemaking q what is a rule issued with respect to a national security function of the united statesa for the purposes of eo  a regulation issued with respect to a national security function is a regulation that satisfies the two following requirementsthe benefitcost analysis demonstrates that the regulation is anticipated to improve national security as its primary direct benefit anda for regulations the agency considers legislative rules oira and the agency agree the regulation qualifies for a good cause exception under  usc bb or b for other regulations including significant guidance the agency and oira agree that applying the requirements of eo  to the regulation would be impracticable or contrary to public interestq what is total incremental costa the term total incremental cost means the sum of all costs from eo  regulatory actions minus the cost savings from eo  deregulatory actionsiv scope questionsq which new regulations as defined in eo  must be offseta agencies are required to offset eo  regulatory actions issued after noon on january   this includes those eo  regulatory actions that are rules finalizing a notice of proposed rulemaking or in certain instances an interim final rule see question  for a further discussion issued before noon on january  agencies should use the existing significance determination process outlined in eo  for determining whether an action is an eo  regulatory action agencies should not assume that actions that appear or have appeared in the unified agenda of regulatory and deregulatory actions as nonsignificant have been determined by oira to be nonsignificant agencies should obtain an affirmative significance determination from oira before publishing regulatory actionsq how are interim and direct final rules treateda in general significant interim and direct final rules must be offset however a significant interim final rule or direct final rule may qualify for an exemption with respect to the timing for identifying and issuing the eo  deregulatory actionsq how are significant rules that finalize interim final rules ifr treateda if the final rule neither increases nor decreases the cost of the ifr then the action does not need to be offset nor does it qualify as an eo  deregulatory action if the final rule includes changes that increase the cost of the ifr then the final rule must be offset however if the final rule imposes only de minimis costs relative to the ifr the final rule may qualify for an exemption if the final rule reduces the cost of the ifr then the rule and the cost savings relative to the ifr may qualify as an eo  deregulatory actionq must agencies identify eo  deregulatory actions forsignificant advance notices of proposed rulemaking anprma no with respect to rulemaking the requirements of eo  do not apply to prenotice of proposed rulemaking activities such as anprmsq  how are regulatory actions that implement federal spending programs or establish fees and penalties treateda in general federal spending regulatory actions that cause only income transfers between taxpayers and program beneficiaries eg regulations associated with pell grants and medicare spending are considered transfer rules and are not covered by eo  additionally an action that establishes a new fee or changes the existing fee for a service without imposing any new costs does not need to be offset nor does an action that establishes new penalties or fines or changes those already in existencehowever in some cases such regulatory actions may impose requirements apart from transfers or transfers may distort markets causing inefficiencies in those cases the actions would need to be offset to the extent they impose more than de minimis costs examples of ancillary requirements that may require offsets include new reporting or recordkeeping requirements or new conditions other than user fees for receiving a grant a loan or a permit analogously if an action reduces the stringency of requirements or conditions for transfer recipients or permit holders the action may qualify as an eo  deregulatory action also an action that causes transfers that for example induce moral hazard or other inefficient behavior may need to be offset and an action that reduces such transfers may qualify as an eo  deregulatory actionplease consult with oira on these actions especially with regards to potential distortionary costs due to transfers see omb circular a for a discussion of the distinction between transfers and costs generallyq how are activities treated that are associated with regulatory cooperation or international standardsa regulatory activities associated with regulatory cooperation with foreign governments that reduce costs to entities or individuals within the united states including at the border or otherwise lower the cost of regulations on the united states economy may qualify as eo  deregulatory actions activities associated with standardsetting that reduce costs to entities or individuals within the united states may also qualify as eo  deregulatory actions however agency actions to harmonize with the standards of an international body or foreign government that increase costs on united states entities or individuals may need to be offset oira recognizes such harmonization could also lead to operating efficiencies for businesses that agencies may be able to capture in their analysis of the benefits and costs of eo  actionsagencies should consult oira on how to treat specific regulatory activities related to regulatory cooperation or international standardsettingq do regulatory actions overturned by subsequently enacted laws qualify for savingsa generally yes oira considers acts of congress that overturn final regulatory actions such as disapprovals of rules under the congressional review act to operate in a similar manner as agency eo  deregulatory actionsq do regulatory actions that are vacated or remanded by a court qualify as eo  deregulatory actionsa if a regulatory action issued before noon on january   is vacated by a judicial order for which all appeals have been resolved oira will consider on a casebycase basis whether the regulatory action being vacated qualifies as an eo  deregulatory actionif an eo  regulatory action was issued on or after noon on january   any judicial order for which all appeals have been resolved vacating the regulatory action and any related subsequent agency action such as a withdrawal of a vacated regulation from the code of federal regulations in order to comply with the order will not qualify as an eo  deregulatory action any eo  deregulatory actions used to offset a vacated eo  regulatory action however would be available to offset other eo  regulatory actions after accounting for any sunk costs incurred in complying with the vacated actionif a court permits a regulatory action to remain in effect after a judicial remand for further agency proceedings such as through remand without vacatur the remanded action remains in effect therefore there is no action at the time of remand that could qualify as an eo  deregulatory action in the same way that an agency complies with eo  when issuing a subsequent agency action to revise a remanded regulatory action an agency will similarly need to comply with eo  a subsequent agency action may qualify as an eo  deregulatory action if the subsequent agency action is deregulatory in nature or may need to be offset if the action is a significant regulatory action that is final and that imposes costs ie an eo  regulatory actionagencies should notify oira of any judicial decisions that affect regulatory actions subject to eo q what happens if an eo  deregulatory action is remanded or vacated by a courta as in the answer to the previous question oira recognizes the inherent casebycase nature of the issues raised by the potential remand or vacatur of an eo  deregulatory action for example such decisions may happen years after a rule is finalized and may affect compliance with both the cost allowances and the repeal provisions established pursuant to eo  the agency should contact oira to determine how a remand or vacatur of an eo  deregulatory action affects the agencys obligations under eo q does eo  apply to significant regulatory actions in which the law prohibits the consideration of costs in determining a statutorily required standarda because eo  applies only to the extent permitted by law agencies are still required to comply with their statutory obligations accordingly if a statute prohibits consideration of cost in taking a particular regulatory action eo  does not change the agencys obligations under that statute however agencies will generally be required to offset the costs of such regulatory actions through other deregulatory actions taken pursuant to statutes that do not prohibit consideration of costs because each agencys obligations will differ depending on the particular statutory language at issue these issues must be addressed on a casebycase basisplease consult with oira regarding questions about particular statutory language and its relationship to eo q how do the requirements of eo  apply to significant regulatory actions issued by one agency that do not have the force and effect of law until adopted with or without change by another agencya because the agency authorities that establish such sequential or otherwise overlapping regulatory responsibilities differ by program these actions will need to be handled on a casebycase basis however agencies in these circumstances should always work together to avoid doublecounting costs and cost savings they should also work together as closely as possible when developing regulatory approaches for such programs in cases where one agencys action does not qualify as an eo  regulatory action because it is not a significant regulatory action under eo  associated actions by other agencies may still be covered by eo q does eo  apply to regulatory actions of independent regulatory agenciesa no eo  applies only to those agencies that meet the definition of agency in this guidance nevertheless independent regulatory agencies are encouraged to identify existing regulations that if repealed or revised would achieve cost savings that would fully offset the costs of significant regulatory actions while continuing to meet the agencys statutory obligationsivaccounting questionsq how should costs and cost savings be measureda except where noted in other portions of this guidance costs should be estimated using the methods and concepts appearing in omb circular a there are several types of impacts that under omb circular a could be reasonably categorized as either benefits or costs with the only difference being the sign positive or negative on the estimates in most cases where there is ambiguity in the categorization of impacts agencies should conform to the accounting conventions they have followed in past analyses for example if medical cost savings due to safety regulations have historically been categorized as benefits rather than reduced costs they should continue to be categorized as benefits for eo  regulatory actions identifying cost savings such as fuel savings associated with energy efficiency investments as benefits is a common accounting convention followed in oiras reports to congress on the benefits and costs of federal regulationscost savings estimates for eo  deregulatory actions should follow the same conventions but in reverse only those impacts that have been traditionally estimated as costs when taking a regulatory action should be counted as cost savings when taking an eo  deregulatory action for example the medical cost savings described above as historically being counted as benefits when regulating should not then be counted as negative cost savings when deregulatingan agency that has used different accounting conventions across different past analyses should consult with oira regarding the categorization of ambiguous impacts in general when faced with ambiguity oira will attempt to achieve greater consistency in the categorization of similar types of costs and benefits across different agenciesoira notes that rules that cause an increase in the resources used by federal agencies to accomplish their programmatic goals may need to be offset and rules that reduce the real resources used by federal agencies to accomplish their goals may qualify as eo  deregulatory actions these types of impacts have long been considered regulatory costs under omb circular a and are a component of the costs oira includes in its reports to congress on the benefits and costs of federal regulationsfor eo  deregulatory actions that revise or repeal recently issued rules agencies generally should not estimate cost savings that exceed the costs previously projected for the relevant requirements unless credible new evidence show that costs were previously underestimated on the other hand a less recent regulatory impact analysis ria may need revision to reflect among other things the fact that only costs occurring after the effective date of the regulatory repeal should be the basis for the cost savings estimate ie agencies should not count sunk costs where an agency believes it can significantly improve upon a prior cost estimate especially a recent one through methodological enhancements the agency should first discuss those methodologies with oiraq how should cost savings be determined for regulatory actions that expand consumption andor production optionsa for regulatory actions that expand consumption andor production optionssometimes referred to as enabling regulatory actions or regulationscost savings should include the full opportunity costs of the previously forgone activities opportunity cost in this context would equal the sum of consumer and producer surplus minus any fixed costs see omb circular a for a more detailed discussion of these conceptsgenerally onetime regulatory actions ie those actions that are not periodic in nature that expand consumption andor production options would qualify as eo  deregulatory actionsthere may be situations where this approach for determining the cost offsets generated by an enabling regulatory action is inappropriate for instance this approach may not be appropriate in certain circumstances where if an agency were to fail to issue a regulatory action a significant existing and ongoing economic activity would be prohibited see question  cost offsets for such regulatory actions will be determined on a casebycase basisplease consult with oira on all such nonroutine regulationsq how does executive order  apply to routine hunting and fishing regulatory actionsroutine hunting and fishing regulatory actions that establish annual harvest limits are not required to be offset and are not eligible to be used as cost savings this includes migratory bird hunting frameworks under the migratory bird treaty act and fishery management plans and amendments under the magnusonstevens fishery conservation and management act this exemption does not apply to regulatory actions that affect hunting and fishing activity that are not routine regulatory actionsq what base year should agencies usea agencies should adjust all estimates to  dollars using the gdp deflator as released on march   until further guidance is provided by oiraq how should agencies calculate cost and cost savings for the purpose of eo  accountinga agencies should calculate the present value as of  of costs for eo  regulatory actions and cost savings for eo  deregulatory actions over the full duration of the expected effects of the actions using both  percent and  percent endofperiod discount ratesq in determining costs and cost savings under eo  how should regulatory baselines be determineda for the most part agencies should follow the guidance about regulatory baselines provided in omb circular a however there can be uncertainty which is recognized in omb circular a regarding how best to capture the directive to assess impacts against the state of the world in the absence of the regulation provided below are two cases in which this uncertainty or other challenges arising in the context of omb circular a have often been addressed by performing analyses with multiple baselines in each of these cases oira has also provided guidance about how to determine costs or cost savings for the purposes of eo when a regulatory action finalizes an interim final rule ifr agencies are typically encouraged to present two sets of estimates the overall regulatory impacts and the incremental impacts relative to the ifr for purposes of determining costs or available cost savings under eo  agenciesfinalizing an ifr should include only the incremental impacts of the final rule relative to the ifrthere are multiple federal programs and policiessuch as discharge general permitting under the clean water act or medicare quality performance trackingthat are updated or renewed at regular intervals via rulemaking because these updates reliably occur an assessment of the incremental changes between the previous and updated programs is often much more informative than a comparison of the updated programs against hypothetical discontinuance although multiplebaseline analysis is likely to continue to be encouraged in such cases for analysis conducted under eo  for purposes of eo  costs or cost savings should be determined by the incremental changes between previous and updated programs for example if an agency is statutorily or judicially required to issue a regulation every five years to permit or prohibit an activity and the agency previously issued a regulation to address the requirement the appropriate baseline to use for estimating the costs or cost savings of the new regulation under eo  is likely the existing regulation or interim operating conditions if there is temporarily no regulation in effectplease consult with oira if you have questions regarding the appropriate baseline upon which to calculate costs or cost savingsq how should agencies treat unquantified costs and cost savingsa as stated in omb circular a agencies should use their best efforts to monetize the effects of both regulatory actions and deregulatory actions and in some cases significant guidance documents depending on the likely magnitude of the effects such efforts may include conducting or sponsoring studies to develop monetized estimates in proposeddraft regulatory actions expected to lead to eo  regulatory actions or eo  deregulatory actions agencies should at a minimum clearly identify any nonmonetized costs or cost savings explain the key reasons why monetization is not possible discuss any information the agency has that is relevant to estimating such costs and request information from the public to monetize such costs at the final stagethe weight assigned to unquantified effects will depend on their significance and degree of certainty and will be handled on a casebycase basis see omb circular a for more information on unquantified costsq how should agencies treat eo  regulatory actions and eo  deregulatory actions published by multiple agenciesa these will be handled on a casebycase basis agencies should consult oira as early as possible to determine the appropriate treatment of the actionq can agencies bank cost savings and deregulatory actionsa yes agencies may bank both eo  deregulatory actions and the associated cost savings for use in the same or a subsequent fiscal year towards eo s requirement to identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed unless prohibited by law and separately to comply with the total incremental cost allowance surplus eo  deregulatory actions and cost savings do not expire at the end of a fiscal year and can be used in subsequent fiscal yearsfor example if an agency issues four eo  deregulatory actions the agency may apply them to up to two subsequent eo  regulatory actions including those occurring in a future fiscal year regardless at the end of each fiscal year an agency must be able to identify and should have finalized twice as many eo  deregulatory actions as eo  regulatory actionssimilarly if an agency issues two eo  deregulatory actions with total cost savings of  million to offset the cost of an eo  regulatory action with a cost of  million the agency may bank the surplus cost savings of  million to offset the cost of another eo  regulatory action regardless of when the latter action is issued see questions  and  for accounting conventions that allow for appropriate comparison of costs and cost savings experienced at different time periodsq can eo  deregulatory actions and associated cost savings be transferred within an agencya yes the requirements of eo  apply agencywide an eo  deregulatory action issued by a component in one agency can be used to offset an eo  regulatory action issued by a different component in that same agencyq can eo  deregulatory actions and associated cost savings be transferred between agenciesa an agency that is not able to identify sufficient eo  deregulatory actions for an eo  regulatory action it intends to issue may submit a written request to the director of omb to assess whether the transfer of eo  deregulatory action credits after consultation with the supplying agency would be appropriate before submitting the eo  regulatory action to omb for review under eo  however if the transfer is not appropriate the agency must identify adequate offsets absent an exemptionvi      process questionsq how does eo  affect the consideration of regulatory benefits or other requirements under eo a eo  does not change the requirements of eo  which remains the primary governing eo regarding regulatory review and planning in particular eo  has no effect on the consideration of benefits in informing any regulatory decisions for all eo  regulatory actions and eo  deregulatory actions except where prohibited by law agencies must continue to assess and consider both benefits and costs and comply with all existing requirements and guidance including but not limited to those in eo  and omb circular a q which eo  regulatory actions might qualify for a full or partial exemption from eo  requirementsa the following categories of eo  regulatory actions may qualify for a full or partial exemption from eo s requirements  expressly exempt actions  emergency actions  statutorily or judicially required actions and  de minimis actions these categories are not exhaustive for any eo  regulatory action an agency believes qualifies for an exemption under any of the circumstances provided below agencies should submit exemption requests to oira prior to submitting the action to omb for review under eo  or prior to publication of the eo  regulatory action if it was not subject to eo  reviewexpressly exempt eo  expressly exempts regulations issued with respect to a military national security see question  above or foreign affairs function and regulations related to agency organization management or personnel these actions qualify for a full exemption see  usc emergencies eo  regulatory actions addressing emergencies such as critical health safety financial nonexempt national security matters or for some other compelling reason may qualify for an exemption in most cases exemptions for such rules will be granted with respect to the timing of required offsets allowing the agency to address the emergency before identifying and issuing eo  deregulatory actions agencies will generally still be required to offset such actions if necessary the costs of such actions and the requirement to identify for repeal at least two existing regulations will be moved to the subsequent fiscal year for purposes of determining eo  compliancestatutorily or judicially required  eo  does not prevent agencies from issuing regulatory actions in order to comply with an imminent statutory or judicial deadline even if they are not able to satisfy eo s requirements by the time of issuance however agencies will be required to offset any such eo  regulatory actions as soon as practicable thereafter in addition this flexibility may not apply to discretionary provisions attached to eo  regulatory actions required to comply with statutory or judicial deadlinesde minimis  eo  regulatory actions with de minimis costs may qualify for an exemption for example if oira designates a proposed rule as significant undereo  because it raises novel legal or policy issues and the agency estimates the action would have present value costs of  spread over a large number of persons andor entities oira may exempt the action from some or all of the requirements of eo q is a significant final regulatory action exempt from the requirements of eo  ifthe action was designated not significant at a prior stagea generally no any regulatory action that is identified as significant at the final rule stage that imposes total costs greater than zero would need to be offset to comply with eo  regardless of the determination in an earlier phase therefore the agency should consult oira as soon as possible if it believes an action that was not determined to be significant at the draft or proposed rule stage may now be determined to be significant perhaps due to substantive issues identified through public comment or further agency analysisq how should agencies prioritize existing requirements to repeal or revisea agencies should follow the requirements in eo  for prioritizing existing requirements to repeal or revise eo  establishes regulatory reform task forces in agencies and directs those task forces to evaluate existing regulations and make recommendations to the agency head regarding their repeal replacement or modification consistent with applicable law eo  directs each regulatory reform task force to identify regulations thateliminate jobs or inhibit job creationare outdated unnecessary or ineffectiveimpose costs that exceed benefitscreate a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with regulatory reform initiatives and policiesare inconsistent with the requirements of section  of the treasury and general government appropriations act   usc  note or the guidance issued pursuant to that provision in particular those regulations that rely in whole or in part on data information or methods that are not publicly available or that are insufficiently transparent to meet the standard for reproducibility orderive from or implement eos or other presidential directives that have been subsequently rescinded or substantially modifiedeo  further directs each regulatory reform task force to seek input and other assistance as permitted by law from entities significantly affected by federal regulations including state local and tribal governments small businesses consumers nongovernmental organizations and trade associations input from such public engagement may be used to prioritize recommendations to repeal or revise finally where the costs of an eo  regulatory action will be incurred entirely or to a large degree by a certain sector or geographic area the agency should prioritize eo  deregulatory actions that affect the same sector or geographic area to the extent feasible and permitted by lawq can regulatory and deregulatory actions be bundled in the same actiona yes under certain circumstances many actions submitted to oira for review under eo  consist of logically connected changes to multiple but related sections of the code of federal regulations for example a rule exempting some categories of regulated entities from compliance with a previously issued regulation may also require eligible entities to submit additional documentation to demonstrate eligibility for the exemption in these cases it may be legitimate and appropriate to pursue such changes through a single bundled action and this guidance is not meant to materially change agency decision making in this area where an agency combines such provisions the cost impact the difference between costs imposed and cost savings per question  of such rules will generally determine whether such actions are eo  regulatory actions that need to be offset or eo  deregulatory actions agencies however should avoid artificially bundling provisions that are not logically connected in a single regulatory action oira may determine that the regulatory and deregulatory portions of the rule should be considered separately for purposes of eo  complianceagencies should consult with oira when considering bundling regulatory and deregulatory actionsq when and how should agencies identify eo  deregulatory actionsa the agencys unified agenda of regulatory and deregulatory actions should reflect compliance with the requirements of eo  and should include to the extent practicable eo  deregulatory actions that when combined with eo  deregulatory actions that are not regulations such as paperwork reduction act information collection reforms are sufficient to offset those actions appearing in the agenda that are or are expected to resultin eo  regulatory actions at a minimum the agency should identify all eo  deregulatory actions along with cost savings estimates by the time it submits to omb for review under eo  the corresponding eo  regulatory action in the rare event that an agency is unable to identify sufficient eo  deregulatory actions oira will address such a situation on a casebycase basiswhile each federal register notice should identify whether the regulation is an eo  regulatory action there is no need to discuss specific offsetting eo  deregulatory actions within the same federal register entry additionally offsetting the costs of regulatory actions to comply with the requirements of eo  should not serve as the basisor rationale in whole or in part for issuing an eo  deregulatory actionq when must identified eo  deregulatory actions be finalizeda to the extent practicable agencies should issue eo  deregulatory actions before or concurrently with the eo  regulatory actions they are intended to offset by the end of each fiscal year including any carryover from previous fiscal years agencies should have issued at least twice the number of eo  deregulatory actions as eo  regulatory actions and  appropriately offset the cost of all final eo  regulatory actions issued the offsets should be consistent with their respective total incremental cost allowance for future fiscal years and agencies are expected to maintain compliance to the extent practicable throughout the year these requirements exclude those eo  regulatory actions issued during the year for which either law prohibits compliance with eo  or the agency received an exemption from oira when an agency receives a partial exemption from oira eg with respect to the timing of eo  deregulatory actions the requirements should be addressed as soon as practicable agencies should plan in advance and leave sufficient time if necessary for oira to complete its review under eo  or the paperwork reduction act and for agencies to publish in the federal register any eo  deregulatory actions needed to comply with eo  before the end of each fiscal yearq what happens if an agency is not in full compliance with the requirements of eo  at the end of a fiscal yeara if by the end of a fiscal year an agency does not finalize at least twice as many eo  deregulatory actions as eo  regulatory actions issued during the fiscal year or has not met its total incremental cost allowance for that fiscal year the agency must within  days of the end of the fiscal year submit for the omb directors approval a plan for coming into full compliance with eo  that addresses each of the followingthe reasons for and magnitude of noncompliancehow and when the agency will come into full compliance andany other relevant information requested by the directorthis excludes eo  regulatory actions that are exempt or where compliance with eo  is prohibited by lawomb may recommend that an agency take additional steps to achieve compliance such as publishing a notice in the federal register requesting ideas from the public on eo  deregulatory actions to pursue omb may also request that agencies post plans approved by the directorthis guidance is not intended to and does not create any right or benefit substantive

2017-04-05,Press Briefing on the Congressional Review Act ,james s brady press briefing room am edtmr spicer couple quick  marc short director of legislative affairs is going to go over the congressional review act and what weve got for an updatefirst thing secretary kelly was up on the hill and talked about where we are with immigration we should have a statement out very shortly from the white house discussing some of the highlights if youve seen any of the numbers theres a  percent from this month to last month in terms of immigration being down at  percent q  year to year correctmr spicer year to year and so obviously those are things that youll see  well highlight in the statement but obviously secretary tillerson  secretary kellys testimony was that for background i may try to have some more on syria later today were working on potentially having some more ill give you an update on thatq  before the press conferencemr spicer no no no if we have anything  and then obviously the presser is at  pmq  is it two and twomr spicer two and two in the rose gardenwith that let me turn it over to marc short director of legislative affairs to talk a little about the congressional review act and everything elseq  everything else laughter q  first syria laughter mr short im glad sean is staying because i can just deflect in thanks guys good morning to you we wanted to take a few minutes to talk about what the administration has been focused on in terms of regulatory burden and thats best i think embodied to the congressional review act and legislation and i dont think americans really understand what is the congressional review act and so i want to sort of frame this in the larger context of the regulatory burden that this administration inherited and what were trying to do with thati think the president is keeping his promise to americans to roll back that regulatory burden and as a result i believe that we are helping to spur growth in the american economy we inherited  this administration did  the biggest regulatory burden we believe of any president in american history and after an onslaught of new regulations that we believe were slow on the economy and hardworking americans this administration has gone to work at how to pull that back the previous administration authored more than  major regulations according to the federal register with an estimated cost to the economy of about  billion president trump on the campaign promised several things on this front he promised to freeze regulations and to issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations and he did that he promised that for every one new regulation two old regulations must be eliminated that promise has been kept he promised to lift the restrictions on american energy and hes done that he promised to ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all the regulations that they impose on the americans which are not necessary  and hes done that he promised to cut regulations massively as he said and he has and im asking you to look at what the congressional review act does the congressional review act was signed into law in  and what many of you may know is it allows a limited window for us to actually pull back previous regulations so it allows congress the house and the senate to look at those regulations and to eliminate those that they pass by a simple majority when you change administrations it allows you an additional day legislative calendar window to look back so theres a day backward window and also in the new administration an additional  days on the legislative calendar what all that means i think for  what you guys need to know is that window is closing at the end of april previously there had been one time in history  president bush in  used the congressional review act to sign into law legislation to pull back those regulations this administration has already signed  and there are two more pending for us to sign we believe this is having a dramatic impact in pulling back the regulatory burden as i said and that we believe that so far that cost or that benefit to the economy is over  billion in regulations through the congressional review act that are being saved by the american taxpayer so farin addition as you know were using executive action to stop some of the costs of these regulations he signed more than a dozen executive orders that among other things require us to review the cost of the clean power plan review epas waters to the us regulation clear regulatory burdens to small businesses lift the moratorium on onshore coal leasing begin a plan to reorganize or eliminate wasteful government agencies and to give the hhs secretary the discretion to provide states with the flexibility under obamacare these are all efforts to again in different areas pull back on the regulatory frontsome of the cras are not specific to jobs but many of them are we believe that major companies like ford fiatchrysler general motors sprint softbank exxon lockheed and even carrier have mentioned to the president and the vice president different times that one of the reasons theyre recommitting to job growth in the united states and keeping jobs here is because of the commitment to sign these pieces of legislation to pull back on the regulations that theyve been facing and as well the commitments to tax reformso those are efforts that we believe are helping to create jobs but were asking you today to consider  i know theres a lot of big stories  tax reform healthcare a lot of things youre covering  is that this window on the cra closes and we do think that again that bush having signed one this administration already signed  into law it is a tool that were taking advantage of and that were actually passing this legislation and that working with house and senate leadership there are several more that we hope to sign before this window closes on april thand we believe its actually having a dramatic impact for the american taxpayer do we have those so we also have to give you a quick handout and this i think summarizes what those  are what the two are that are pending and then additionally a couple that have passed the house theyre waiting for action in the senate that we hope to receive to sign into law before the end of april as wellso a quick overview on what the cra does which ones are pending with that id be happy to take questionsq  you said the impact is  billion with a b or million with an mmr short b as in billionq  over what period of time per year mr short andy is the smart one   years q  thats  billion over  yearsmr short yes majorq  when you pass and the president signs a cra it essentially ends that regulatory process and in its place congress has to create something else or nothing happens like with the isp one the fcc cant do anything until congress decides to do something in exchange for whatever was there beforein that instance when you have google facebook and the internet service providers does this administration believe there should be some privacy legislation drafted and passed to deal with those underlying issues or is it simply content to take away this difference between what the regulatory regime was for google and facebook and what it was for the isp onemr short were content right now in pulling back on what was previous major i think when were able to nominate and confirm our own people on the fcc im sure theyll take a fresh look at thatq  on the whole privacy issue and what legislation may be requiredmr short im not telling you there will be legislation required im simply saying that theyre going to take a fresh look at that and there will be time for them to do that for now we thought it was appropriate to sign the legislation that repealed what was thereq  thank you what do you say to critics who say youre not carefully considering the regulations enough on their own merit for example congressman mcgovern  jim mcgovern  said bringing things up without any review by committee of jurisdiction under closed rules and in a way that may have some unintended consequences is a stupid way to do things is there a risk of doing this too quicklymr short i think there was a huge risk to the economy what was happening before and i think that there was  what was happening is clearly from the executive agencies i think impacts were not even getting reviewed by the legislative branch so i think that what were actually doing is allowing the legislative branch to work its will in coordination with us to try to pull back on things that were not done legislativelyq  you commented that youre reviewing each regulation carefully enough that youre not running roughshod over some of thesemr short yesq  given that your difficulty is getting healthcare legislation passed do you think that your regulatory repeals are going to be the major legislative accomplishment for the foreseeable future with this administrationmr short no i think that this is a huge accomplishment in the first quarter i think you have to keep in mind again that this window closes so in concert with speaker ryan and leader mcconnell there was clearly an intentional effort to say this is our window to do this and we have to focus on iti think there has no doubt been a lot of focus in the media on other issues and not this legislative track and i confess that any one of these is not going to really drive a news story but i think if you take in totality what weve been trying to do on the regulatory front it is a news story and so i do think its an accomplishmenti also think that legislatively we certainly look forward to confirming judge gorsuch on friday and i think that that is certainly as well something that we will look back proudly upon at the process that was laid out there the process of choosing that particular nominee and helping to get him confirmed i think as somebody who has proven to be a terrific jurist and will make an impact on the supreme court for decades to comeq  do you think that  this has been done more times than all other presidents combined since the cra was passed and its being used to roll back exclusively regulations from the obama administration do you think that using the cra so much during this review period sets a precedent where one administration will come in and just get rid of everything the previous one did and do you worry that this could happen on the opposite side if democrats take back congress and the white house and how do you have continuity if this keeps happeningmr short fair question but i think there are several things that made this environment possible keep in mind its not something that is done unilaterally we have to work with congress to get it passed so there is a process it has to get majorities in the house and the senate before it ever reaches us to actually pull back on these regulationsi think that what happened was during the obama administration there was a historic number of regulations put into place that afforded this administration that opportunity to pull them back but i also think its a promise that president trump made on the campaign trail to the american people that he would do exactly thisand so therefore we believe that its fulfilling a campaign promise we said this is something that is crippling the american economy and were going to address it and this is one of the vehicles through which were addressing itq  but say you guys get done with this review period and the trump administration starts putting forth regulations and the next president say is a democrat and the democrats take back congress and they do the same thing do you worry that mr short keep in mind this tool only allows us to go back to  calendar days in legislative action so were not able to look at eight years of the obama administrationq  i realize that but my point is do you worry that youre setting a precedent where this could come off as sort of vengeful we won were going to erase what you did and the next guy is going to come in and do the same thingmr short i dont think its done with a vengeful spirit i think its done with q  i didnt say it was i said inaudible mr short your word was vengeful so im repeating your question but i think what we said is that this is what the president campaigned on is that he would look to peel back the regulatory burden this is one of the vehicles to do that and i think thats the bigger message is that we promised that to the american taxpayer the american job creator and this is one of the vehicles through which we are accomplishing that endyes sirq  once this window closes at the end of the month whats your deregulatory effort going to look like and can you give us a preview of what specific industries might be affected after this tool expiresmr short great question i do think that because of this theres been more focus on it in the first quarter of this year but i think that well continue  what instead will happen probably is youll see more action from the executive branch so i think therell be some secretaries for whom their industries in particular theyll be looking to pass new orders that may be addressed  some of the regulatory burden thereq  can you spotlight any industries you have in mind at targetingmr short no im going to leave that to the cabinet secretaries to address themselvesyes sirq  two questions one on the regulatory stuff a fair bit of the regulation that youve gone after has already  never actually went into effect because its been tied up in courts as you said or hadnt been fully implemented because you can only go back a certain number of days as you said anywayso is it fair to  i mean as we sort of try to judge how effective you guys have been  i mean some of the stuff that youre rolling back and youve talked about the numbers of impact   billion  is that a fair way to measure it given that it never took  some of the stuff never took mr short those are estimated costs of what the impact would be i dont know another way to sort of gauge that for youq  and second question on healthcare talk a little bit about these meetings that have taken place yesterday on capitol hill last night with the vice president earlier in the day you know youre the guy in charge of trying to get this stuff done on healthcare where do you  give us some sense on a scale of  to  or a percentage rating or whatever how close  or timing  you know how close are we  a day a week a month a year  from some kind of redo on the healthcare billmr short sure what i would say is that look the healthcare system in america needs to be addressed we know that patients are getting crushed by the current system we know that insurers are fleeing the exchanges its a promise that republican lawmakers have made since  to repeal obamacare there unity in what that goal isi think that what weve seen in the last couple days that encourages us is that members within the republican conference that frankly previously were not engaged in the conversations are now in engaged in them so last night when we had members of the freedom caucus and the tuesday group and the rsc in the same room talking through the same issues we feel like that is progress i think that there is a great sense from the members that say we know as well that this is a promise we made to the american people and we have to get to a better result than we did two weeks ago and i think there is a sense of partnership with the administration reaching thati cant give you a timetable as to when we think that that will happen but i can tell you that i think there is a  there is not people within our conference  republican conference  saying no there are people saying not yet and i think that we are getting closer and closer to this process to hopefully making sure that we put in place a better healthcare systemq  we talked a couple of days ago about a text  some legislative text that people said was going to be coming out of this building then we never saw it mr short i think some of those reports were erroneous i think that theres been some discussions about conceptually what are the new ideas that would help bridge some of the impasse and bring groups together as to what timetable we will have text available to review im not committed to that yetq  to follow up on that if you say that there are members who were not engaged but now are engaged  not saying no but saying not yet  what are the issues that are on the table that are being discussed that are bringing them in like what concessions has  or compromise options has the white house put out specific policy pointsmr short i think that when i say that there are groups not engaged to be clear what im saying is theyre not engaged in the same room so they were engaged but it was sort of this  as some people around here call it  the shuttle diplomacy whereas now were all in the same room having the same conversation togetheras far as the issues that were discussing i think theyve been well circulated i think that we want to make sure that whatever reforms are done are making sure that premiums are brought down i think that that is one of the primary concerns yet youre still providing access to patientsyes sirq  i know when the ahca was first rolled out there was this talk of a phase two where there would be a bunch of regulatory changes on healthcare does the administration plan to go forward with those changes regardless of what happens with the legislation in congressmr short i dont want to speak for secretary price but i believe that  look we are committed to making sure that reforms are done that he can handle in ways that benefit the patient so i dont think were looking to slow that downmr koenig before you go on if there are any more questions on the cra keep your hands up and then marc im sure will be happy to answer a couple more questions on healthcare but were really here on the cra so we could go that direction first and then a couple more on healthcare and then were going to be doneq  im wondering if you can tell us a little bit about how this fits into the conservative philosophy like what youre hoping to achieve and whether or not theres discussions about the direction that conservative philosophy is goingmr short sure well thanks i think that theres a lot of members in the house and the senate and this administration believe that a more limited role of government is beneficial to our economy and provides consumers with more freedom and i think that thats the overarching way that we look at a lot of the regulatory burden we want to make sure that the government has the right role in ensuring that industries are safe but we dont want to go beyond that in ways that we are losing jobs and i think the president made clear that what we need to do is to create jobs for americansand so we want to make sure that the agencies in charge of providing safety are doing that yet at the same time not providing undue burdens that crush job creators and i think that that is part of the conservative philosophyq  just to follow up how do you reconcile the goals that you have with the inaudible government like the midwestern conservative who wants that as opposed to like the infrastructure program that the president has talked about how does that workmr short i think there will be a lot more to come on the infrastructure at a later time but i think one thing the administration has said is theyre looking for publicprivate partnerships that i think will provide opportunities where its not simply on the taxpayers shoulders but i think as well there is clearly a need  even whether youre conservative liberal  were finding the interest from legislators across the spectrum to say we want to work with you on infrastructure because we recognize the infrastructure is crumbling in americayes sirq  can you talk briefly about the cra and the decisions that are being made by the administration and how this intersects with the presidents larger tax plan for the american people you talked about saving the taxpayers money can you talk a little bit about that relationship brieflymr short i wouldnt want to exaggerate the relationship with tax reform i think that we have been in contact with the speaker and the leader about prioritizing which cras are brought up and when so there is a concerted and coordinated strategy on that i think tax reform is simply going to be a separate vehicle in which were trying to prioritize tax breaks to the middle class that we feel are getting crushedq  on tax reform the president  like most politicians but maybe more so  has not spoken much in the language of tradeoffs which obviously tax reform will require how are you planning on selling this because the healthcare  that was one of the difficulties how are you going to sell tax reform and make sure that the tradeoffs dont become an impediment and helping the president adjust his languagemr short i think that healthcare  conversations that weve had have shown that in many cases democrats recognize the challenge to the current healthcare system and theyre uncomfortable with the increases that they face for  the constituents have faced but i think the effort of repealing obamacare would be something that would complicate their base and so theres probably less partnership in thattax reform though i think we find that there will be actually interest in many cases many democrats have reached out to say that they want to help on this process too they recognize its been  years since significant tax reform was done so i dont necessarily say that one is conditional upon the other i think there will be bipartisan interest to work on tax reformyes sirq  on the cra there is a legal theory percolating around out there that the cra applies not just to regulations but sort of guidance documents other sort of soft regulations and if those were never submitted to congress or their gao that day clock never started is the administration doing anything on that issue to do a retrospective look at whether there may be additional regulatory dark matter that could be submitted through the cra processmr short you can answer himmr koenig as far as we know counterparts in the senate are taking a look at that theres some guidance that we need from folks on the hill from congressional researchers so theyre looking at it we havent weighed in one way or the other on that were focused on the ones that are clearly within the statuteq  who at the white house has been spearheading sort of identifying the regulations that could be rolled back which ones you wanted to roll back has this been a hilldriven process mostly and who has been  sort of who are the different players heremr short its no doubt a process that is driven by the hill but its one in which weve been in coordination with them so thats partly my job i lean on andy to be the brains of our leg affairs team so he helps me understand from a policy perspective which ones are most important but no doubt that the way legislation is drafted is for congress to take the lead in repealing executive branch regulationsq  so if the point of all this is to create jobs and stimulate the economy how does repealing internet privacy rules do thatmr short its fair  as i said in the beginning  that not each one of these can you look at and say it is necessarily a job creator there are some that i think are addressing other regulations so i accept your premise but i would ask you to look back and say that many of these do in fact have significant job impact and as i opened what were trying to say is theres been an enormous effort not just in cras but also in executive orders to try to address the regulatory burden and this is one way that were hoping youll take a fresh look in saying this window closes at the end of april so therefore its worth us taking a look and saying okay what has been the collective effort between the administration and congress to address this i accept your point that not every single one q  what was the point of repealing it though what was the point of repealing that one or what is your justification for that is my questionmr short do you want to address what senator flakes initiativemr koenig its duplicative of ftc regulations that are already in place as another layer of compliance for isps that were already as i said regulated under ftc and was now adding a fcc requirement that was treating them as if they were outside of the sphere of other internet providersthis wasnt something that was being applied to search engines this wasnt something that was being applied to social media providers so this was something that was duplicative of regulations that were already on the books and not necessary in our opinionq  i wanted to follow up on how this is  in totality this is a real news story is there a concern that the president is going to get through his first  days without any significant legislation is that one of the reasons youre heremr short i think there is a concern that this is an important story that has not been told ill leave for others to shape the first hundred days i think that when you look back and you say in the hundred days we will confirm a supreme court justice i consider that a pretty significant achievement so im not here from a position of saying we need to justify the first hundred days i do think that this is a story that has not been told and i think that there are other stories that  obviously you have your own jobs to do that are easier to explain to the american people and certainly healthcare the supreme court others are out there but this i think is an untold one which is why we wanted to be here and share it with you todaymr koenig mark thank you very much and i guess i would just add to this part of  to follow up on your question here were also trying to make administration officials available to talk through a lot of  on background  a lot of these issues to help explain them so hopefully if these arent helpful to you all let us know and well stop doing them but i mean to your point q  no they are laughtermr koenig so were trying to create more of a dialogue and make stars out of our administration officials so i do have the paperwork that marc referenced so i can hand these outand actually before we all go i want one other thing clear about this this was on the record you can use this we also are going to try  we will let you know when these are on background but weve heard the requests that many have made that we need to do more of these on record and this was on the record and well try to do moreend am edt

2017-03-31,Background Press Briefing on Financial Disclosure Forms ,james s brady briefing room pm edtsenior administration official ladies and gentlemen were just going to continue kind of moving on a quick pace because we do have  weve got multiple events happening today and we got a hard stop today at  for this so im going to be very brief just a couple of ground rules for this this is going to be a background briefing on the release of the financial disclosure forms that will happen later today the embargo for this briefing is  pmi would like to introduce two individuals and they can give you their full titles when they come up here but senior administration officials are with the white house counsels office what theyre going to do is walk you through the process exactly what these individuals had to go through and give you kind of a broad brush of what you will see once these records are released later on this evening and hopefully if you can keep your questions to the process i think well be able to get through this more quickly and with more useful information but with that let me introduce senior administration officials if youd like to take the podiumsenior administration official thanks very much weve both been working pretty hard for a while on putting together the financial disclosures that are going to be made available online this afternoon and this evening and so we thought what wed do now is take an opportunity to walk through both what it is that youre going to be seeing what it represents and also how it fits into the process so that as youre analyzing the financial disclosures you have a sense of what it is that youre looking at where we have gone from the time when weve received the information that were releasing how this process continues going forward and gives you the opportunity to ask the kind of questions and doing it in a way that is based on the facts and what it is that we haveso what i want to make sure that were talking about is that everyone understands how the information that you have that were going to be releasing this afternoon is developed and just a process point at the outset were going to be putting live later this afternoon on our website the ability the enter a form  its called a  form which is a legally required form that if youre requesting financial information you say what your name is you identify a little bit of information and your email address who it is that youre seeking financial information on you enter that and then later this afternoon or this evening were going to be sending out to everybody who went online this afternoon and asked for a specific person were going to actually send you the pdf of the full  form as we have it in the current form which is going to then give you the opportunity to follow up with the press office as to any additional questions but we want to make sure that you understand what it is that youre seeingand the other piece that i want to make sure that were talking about is to understand that the documents that youre going to be seeing which are comprehensive financial disclosure documents that talk through salaries assets commonly held assets with spouses  its a very comprehensive set of documentation understand that the documents though that youre going to be seeing which are going to be listing lots of assets and lots of holdings are going to be the starting point the documents that we receive  as people come into government they would fill out this form and they would identify all of their assets and all of their information this is then the information that we  and my colleague is going to talk through it because hes really been taking the laboring more on meeting with every single one of our commissioned officers talking through how we handle the issues talking about what potential conflict of interest there might be and then helping everyone work through what the ethics agreements are going to be as folks have been migrating through the process but understand that when you see lots of assets on these forms these are not the current holdings that everyone has today these are the holdings that everybody had at the time when they came into office so youre going to see a lot of people that are holding a lot of assets that one would say well gee isnt a conflict of interest if this person has this asset today what are we supposed to make of that and we want to make sure that everyone is cautioned here against simply writing a story that says this person holds this today there must be a conflict of interestthis as i said the starting process is we looked at this information as it came into us its the basis that we used then to have a sitdown meeting with every single one of the public filers the public filers is every single commissioned officer and every single civilian white house employee who is making over  so every commissioned officer and everyone who is making above that is a public filing disclosure and is going to be subject to your inquiryand so what we did is once we identified this information sat down with them said look we have identified these assets theres a process now to how youre going to be divesting yourself you cant hold this asset and do the job that youre tasked with doing here how are we going to go through the process of selling it and theres a very sort of complex process of getting whats called a certificate of divestiture  and my colleague can talk through a little bit about that also theres a lot of information that the office of government ethics puts out they actually put out a very hand document that we have some copies of of what the certificate of divestiture process works with we hand this out to our folks to say before you can sell the asset that might be a conflict you have to work with us and the office of government ethics to make sure that weve gotten the proper certificates before you unwind the assetsand so that entire process is what were going to turn over and im going to let my colleague speak to but theres one or two other just points that i wanted to speak to the first of which is i want to highlight the incredible complexity and the sophistication of the assets and the financial structures that this white house is going to present these are incredibly successful individuals very high net worth very sophisticated complex asset structures numerous subllcs trusts and other items all of which have to be worked through very helpfully the office of government ethics prepared a report analyzing the sophistication of this incoming white house versus the preceding administration and they created a fairly helpful document weve got some copies of it for you thats again created by the office of government ethics that talks through  under the obama administration these were simple ones moderately difficult complex and for those who are fans of spinal tap these were the elevens out of ten on the scale and you can see how the complexity relates from the folks that were in the previous administration to the complexity that weve been dealing with hereand i would invite anyone to go from this to make sure youre also talking to the office of government ethics if you want full sort of feedback on what the nature is of how this process works theyre going to talk to the sophistication and the complexity of what were doingtheyre also going to tell you that this is a process that it is very common extraordinarily common for there to be changes even from here going forward as we work through with people making sure were characterizing the documents properly and that its not at all unusual if you see something that you download today and that  days from now there might be a minor change to it  youre going to get to see those things but that thats not going to be an indicator that maybe something was amiss or that someone was hiding somethingand id refer you to the office of government ethics i think theyre going to be pretty happy to share that with youbefore i turn it over to my colleague i wanted to do one other thing just to talk about how the timeline here all works as somebody comes into the administration they have  days to fill out this form so the documents that youre going to be seeing are the documents that were filled out by people within  days theyre entitled to two day extensions we had very few of those everybody who was there on the first day has the s originally filed and into usfrom the time that the person files we in the office of the white house counsel have another  days to really look through and review all of these documents before the public has the opportunity to request these documents thats pretty much where we are now for folks who started at the beginningi did a little bit of research to see when the preceding administration did their sort of release of everyone i think i found some washington post articles from april rd  saying last night on a friday the white house released all this information so wed point out today is the st a little earlier than the april the rd and what happens then with respect to our most senior filers  the assistants to the president deputy assistants to the president  is theres actually an additional review process that happens with the office of government ethics that is going to be an ongoing process we are going to continue working with them as they will then review and then provide feedback to us and they can talk about how that worksso again this is an ongoing process the documents youre going to be seeing are a snapshot in time  an entry snapshot in time and we want to make sure that everyone understood what it is that youre looking atand with that im going to turn it over to my colleague who can talk through sort of the process that he went throughsenior administration official thanks so this all started prior to day one for most folks in the administration that had been appointed to the white house where day one they begin filling out these forms and a lot of folks started working directly with oge the incoming white house counsel staff and then postday one we assisted all of the commissioned officers with preparing the reports and that takes some time as the reports get complete we have to make sure theyre accurate they have to be submitted by each individual filer they have to certify that theyre accurate to the best of their knowledge we assist them through the process to make sure that its clearly  the assets are clearly delineated in the particular formsand at that time we start counseling immediately because the ethics laws apply day one and we begin counseling immediately as to potential conflicts what they should be recusing themselves from what they should consider divesting from and what they need to resign from and those are kind of the three components its resign divest and then recuse in that orderso folks who were in other jobs or other positions so to speak  and it doesnt even mean paid positions  have to resign from those positions prior to beginning government service and everyone did in the case of i think two very good examples that im going to use today  gary cohn and jared kushner  for instance jared kushner had  positions that he had to resign from he began early on in january maybe even prior to january in starting to prepare to get into this process gary cohn did the same thing he resigned from all his positions immediately and worked through itthe divestiture part pertains to assets so that relates to assets that they may be involved in obviously kushner had a number of different assets with a number of different companies hes in the process or has divested and has divested from most of those that may have created a conflict of interest coming into this job now both of those individuals had very broad responsibilities so its very important that were in tune to the fact that these broad responsibilities  and we are recusing from the issues that they need to recuse from  but divestiture is the most important thing and gary cohn within  days for his liquidated stocks interests and within  days for his goldman sachs interest will be fully divested and hes far ahead of that process nowas that process goes on we move to the ethics agreement portion of it every single commissioned officer in this administration will have an ethics agreement that means its an agreement that the white house counsels office and the individual has agreed upon what theyre going to divest what theyre going to recuse from and that will all be delineated in writing so its very clear as to what they need to do going forward to be both in compliance with the ethics laws and the pledge  the ethics pledgeso thats kind of the process that we go through at this stage everyone has filed  that started day one january th  everyone has filed we are in the process  some have ethics agreements thats are prepared some dont weve counseled everyone ive sat with every assistant to the president and given them personal counseling ive been managing a team of lawyers  because i think its roughly  folks that have come through the process  a team of lawyers who have been meeting both on phone calls and in person with each one of the commissioned officers in this administrationso thats kind of a flavor for it in terms of divestiture i talked a little bit about gary and jared and another person  another good example is reince he was a lawyer and worked at the rnc he resigned from the rnc resigned from his law firm but not only that he divested from his interest in his law firm and that is a story thats told all the way across the board with this administration because its so important that were able to  that theyre able to do their jobs conflictfree q  what happened in the very few instances where a person may have started the process but is no longer with the white house are those documents senior administration official okay so we have a number of individuals who started some of them filed some of them didnt the ones who have filed some of them are going to be certified and some of them arent because it depends how much activity that we had throughout the process and when they resigned or when they left the administration so there are a few that will be uncertified but will be publicly available q  can you talk about whether youve issued any ethics waivers is everybody who had a prior relationship with some company or entity recusing themselves or are there some instances where youve gone ahead and accepted that theres going to be some conflictsenior administration official waivers are only issued in very limited instances and im going to talk about process right nowso for instance if we have folks who  and i want to step back and talk a little bit about divestiture so part of the process  and its important that we get started with that process early in divestiture  is to work with oge to get whats called  my colleague talked about it  a certificate of divestiture the certificate of divestiture allows for deferred tax treatment because youre selling off assets and it defers to the capital gains if you reinvest the money back into exempted funds which a  act regulated mutual fund is a good example of that so that takes some timeso there are  the first thing that happens is the filer makes a request to the white house counsels office or the ethics official that will then make a request to oge for a certificate of divestiture for all of the stocks theyre divesting fromif theres a conflict that you cant recuse from  in limited instances it may make sense to issue waivers where the conflict is so remote where theres a de minimis issue theres a number of different circumstances where you have trusts that dont necessarily involve the particular individual and those instances it makes sense  and its done in consult with oge  waivers will be issuedsenior administration official right and i just want to add one other point that goes along with that because its a very particularized process of selling these assets and you dont get the divestiture  the tax benefit for doing it if you do it incorrectly  there are a lot of individuals who might have been ready to sell their assets but because we had to make sure were walking them through get these signed off and these actually issued by the office of government ethics there are some people who are in the process of still unwinding their assets and weve had a lot of sort of questions about thatq  but if i could just follow up on that what about if youre not talking about assets youre talking about a prior affiliation with a large entity like goldman sachs or breitbart hypothetically do you have to take some action to waive any potential impact they may have in their decisions on that entity even if theyre completely divested from assets relatedsenior administration official so well talk about gary cohn because i started talking about him earlier and you mentioned goldman sachsin that instance where goldman sachs is implicated  he worked for goldman sachs  its a twoyear ban on dealing with specific matters  particular matters with specific parties and for general matters relative to general applicability he would be able to impact matters  like gary is on the economic council for instance so hes not going to be recused from handling anything that may impact goldman sachs from a policy perspective thats what hes here to do is impact the economic policyin this instance he would not be meeting with goldman sachs as part of his ethics agreement relative to specific mattersq  can i just ask a couple logistical questions about today anita kumar from mcclatchy you mentioned  is that whats available today  people  reportssenior administration official just about there are some that  because there was this process that some of the folks were able to sort of file a little bit late i believe though that virtually everyone  and i think almost all of the senior folks are all sufficiently through that process there might be some people who we havent certified yet but who we are making availableq  so just a handful that wont be another day of another thing like this it will just be senior administration official no no no this is going to be the vast majorityq  you mentioned this afternoon and you mentioned this evening can you tell us the times and what does that mean exactlysenior administration official sure and im not positive exactly when the time was but sometime this afternoon later this afternoon  pm  pm  pm  something like that  up on our website is going to go live the link that allows you to fill out the request form its a five senior administration official fivepartq  and so we should just look for it or well get an emailsenior administration official probably look for it i guesssenior administration official check on the white house webpagesenior administration official yes yes it will be  it wont be hiddenq  okay we request whateversenior administration official okay so you fill out this form and you say i would like to see the financial disclosure forms for  and then pick whoever it is anyone who has filled that thing out were going to be sending out tonight the q  what time tonightsenior administration official well probably collect them  because were not going to do them piecemeal so tonight probably around  well have a team of folks kind of emailing out to  for instance if  people in this room asked for gary cohns  which im sure everyone in this room is going to ask for  gary cohns financial disclosure we will have someone thats charged with putting that into an email and sending to everyone who requested it senior administration official but were going to be sending mass  q  one last thing for those of us who dont have the  names just on our computers here ready to ask you for all  is there a list of the  that would be available roughlysenior administration official i dont know that there is a list of white house staff availableq  so you have to make  requests senior administration official yeah and thats required by the form in terms of q  but do you have to make  requests for  names but youre not going to give us the names we could sit here and go look them up but can you not provide thatsenior administration official i dont know that i can certainly i dont know that i have that listsenior administration official no were not  were following the instructions and the guidelines and following along the way the obama administration senior administration official no different than what they didsenior administration official  what the obama administration did were doing it exactly the same way exactly the same mannerq  okay thats not  you do lots of things differently than the obama administration inaudible about every day so dont rely on the obama administration senior administration official actually no no youre absolutely right you know what we did differently were actually ahead of schedule so the obama administration released these items on april rd and were now march st so we are differentq  two questions for you one is now that youve finished up doing this round can you tell us how many billionaires work in this administration laughter senior administration official there are lot of different ways to look at assets were going to make  its all going to be clear its going to be assets its going to be q  inaudible personal net worth over  billionsenior administration official i dont know the statistic number on that youre going to have that available to you tonightsenior administration official its all going to be available yessenior administration official and im sure you know the names to have requestq  are we going to see a financial disclosure separately from ivanka trump who i guess has just taken a staff job just this weeksenior administration official yeah not today she literally two days ago started the process she has  days to even fill in the form jared will be theresenior administration official the good news about that is is that for purposes of jared kushner all of her assets are imputed to him so theres not going to be any surprisesq   forms from the president and vice presidentsenior administration official yes its a separate form i believe its may th but i dont know that for sure its legally required i know ive seen some press reporting i dont know the decision has been made whether on may th  because its not required if hes going to do it but thats a different q  how many ethics letters have you sent out and when will they be available for us to reviewsenior administration official ethics agreements you mean is that what youre speaking of ethics agreements are presidential records theyre internal documents always have beenq  so we wont see thosesenior administration official right correct q  post the waivers like the administration didsenior administration official no the document hes talking about the ethics agreement every single employee has an agreement that we enter  heres what youre going to be doing to run through it i think were goodq  a separate question actually you said there are going to be assets listed that they may not have divested from correct so how will we know if we look at a form if theres a series of assets listed what they have divested from and is there some kind of update form that they then have to filesenior administration official youre going to have ask the questionsq  so we have to then go through it and say okay jared has x y z  or whoeversenior administration official but also its a continuing process too people continue to file like every year there are going to be some  this isnt the only time that people file thisq  no no i get thatsenior administration official to the extent assets are sold off after folks are employees of the government a t will be filed at that point within a certain amount of time that says  thats a separate form but some of these folks like i said divested before they came inq  with the waiver  let me ask the question on waivers are you guys going to make available the waivers so we can see thosesenior administration official  waivers relative to the ethics  relative to the ethics act are by law required to be available publiclysenior administration official right and we will do thatq  we get those through the same request process or youre just going to post them like the previous ethics waiverssenior administration official i dont know the answersenior administration official were going to have to discuss that i think thats a great question that we actually when we were talking about this earlier  well come up with a policy on thatso to be clear q  wait  inaudible senior administration official no no no im  were good q  inaudible i understand but we do have a hard stop here q  these are really good questions laughtersenior administration official actually all of you had really good questions but the most important part is when you do have questions  further questions on this  please direct those questions to the press office we will work with either  with the lawyers and find who has the exact answer for youbut the best way for you to do this is to go through the press office rather than q  whos on point in the press officesenior administration official its who wasnt nice to me today yes and so please go through the press office because if you go to the individuals directly all theyre going to do is come back to ussenior administration official there was a question about ivanka  so ivanka trump is a commissioned officer who does have to file  even without the salary will be filing a  form but as my colleague has said as part of the  that youre going to see on jared kushner it lists all of the assets including all of her assets youre going to see a massive portion of already whats in there the only thing thats not is a unique small piece relating to her which she will do she is a commissioned officer so she will be a public filer you will get hers she just hasnt even filed it shes an employee as of two days agosenior administration official all right thank you very much guysend pm edt ,20663.220703,-13.009764999998882,-0.0006296097393040986,5911.740234000001,-17.060058000000026,-0.0028857929010282068,2362.719971,-3.879883000000064,-0.001642125621157694

2017-03-31,Background Press Briefing on the Upcoming Visits of President al-Sisi of Egypt and His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan ,james s brady briefing room am edtsenior administration official good morning id like to welcome everybody whos here and everybody whos dialed into our morning nsc backgrounder on the upcoming egypt and jordan visits senior administration official were going to address two topics that are coming up one next week weve got president sisi coming in on the third of april and weve got king abdullah coming in for a white house visit on  aprilto begin with i will make a few comments about the president sisi visit the president is excited to welcome egyptian president alsisi to the white house on  april and he wants to use president sisis visit to reboot the bilateral relationship and build on the strong connection the two presidents established when they first met in new york last septemberegypt is one of the traditional pillars of stability in the middle east and has been a reliable us partner for decades president trumps initial interactions with president alsisi including their phone call on january rd have already improved the tone of the relationship and we hope next weeks visit continues this positive momentumpresident trump aims to reaffirm the deep and abiding us commitment to egypts security stability and prosperity president sisi has taken a number of bold steps on very sensitive issues since becoming president in  hes called for reform and moderation of islamic discourse initiated courageous and historic economic reforms and sought to reestablish egypts regional leadership rolehe has also led egypts campaign to defeat a longrunning terrorist threat in the sinai the united states wants to support president alsisis efforts in all of these areas our relationship has historically been driven by security and that will remain a key component of the engagement with egypt the us and egyptian militaries have built close relationships and many military officers from egypt have trained at us military installationspresident trump also supports alsisis ambition to develop a comprehensive counterterrorism approach that involves military political economic as well as social efforts but president trump also wants to increase the focus on economic and commercial cooperation in our bilateral relationship building a more stable and productive economy is a critical step to ensuring longterm stability in egypt and president sisi we would like to note has begun a necessary economic reform plan that will strengthen the egyptian economy if it is fully executedtheres no question the transition in their economy will be difficult but in the long run egypt will be stronger if it follows through on its homegrown reform plan our relationship with egypt is complex and covers a number of very challenging issues and were fully aware that next weeks meeting is only the start of a long process of improving this historical relationship we are optimistic that we are heading in the right direction and president trump is very much looking forward to the visitnow just a few comments on the visit of king abdullah the president is pleased to welcome king abdullah on april th the two leaders will gather for a meeting in the oval office and then proceed to a working lunch jordan is a key partner for the united states in the region and we anticipate the two leaders will discuss a range of shared priorities including efforts to defeat isis how to end the conflict in syria and advancing progress between the israelis and the palestiniansthe president met with king abdullah briefly on the sidelines of the national prayer breakfast in february and at that time the two agreed on this followon meeting it was important to the president that he welcome king abdullah to the white house early in his administration as a sign of the strong friendship and partnership of utmost importance this is an opportunity for the president to convey his continued support for our steadfast partnership with jordan on a range of key regional issues and as the president has said well work with our allies including our friends and allies in the muslim world to extinguish isis jordan is a critical partner in that effort and it plays an outsized role in this effort as well as in the region and with that that concludes our opening comments senior administration official and again id like to thank everyone for being here and id just like to remind everyone that we have these two gentlemen who are national security policy experts this backgrounders purpose is to provide answers to you on issues relating to these two topics  the upcoming visits and the relationships with these two countriesso please respectfully pitch your questions that way also at your request you can expect that when were done here we have a onepage written backgrounder that will be submitted on both countries to you guys so please stick around after this to receive thatq  is the president expected to provide major financial assistance to the egyptians and will he bring up the issue of a human rights crackdownsenior administration official weve had a longstanding relationship with substantial foreign military assistance and economic support that support has continued and we anticipate it will continue until the futurewere in the budget process right now and those discussions are ongoing as to how it will be broken out but we are going to maintain a strong and sufficient level of support to egypt and jordanq  and the human rights crackdown will the president bring that up with alsisisenior administration official human rights are always an issue of concern to the united states and theyre first and foremost in our discussions our approach is to handle these types of sensitive issues in a private more discreet way and we believe its the most effective way to advance those issues to a favorable outcome q  do you anticipate a conversation with king abdullah about the refugees that the jordanians have taken in and any sort of help that the americans would provide in terms of financial support or aid to those refugees since we have slowed down our refugee program to the ussenior administration official the united states and the international community are fully engaged in providing support to jordan for those refugees that are within jordan and those camps as well as providing assistance to refugees that are on the syrian side of the border which is a difficult situation and were working with jordan to make sure that their interests are taken into account as well as making sure  in collaboration with the international community that the needs of those refugees on the other side of the border are fully addressedq  quick followup do you anticipate a conversation about syrian safe zones around the border region right there obviously the jordanians may be involved in the making of the safe zones senior administraton official the issue of what we would call interim deescalation areas rather than safe zones is one that is a consistent part of our dialogue with jordan as well as others that are involved in  whether its the geneva talks that are focused on resolving the syrian conflict or in a bilateral way in trying to develop options to provide security safety and humanitarian access for displaced people whether theyre internally displaced in the country or fostering an environment where external refugees can return to their home countryq  two questions regarding president alsisis visit will the president be discussing with president alsisi any issues concerning the egyptrussia relationship and russias attempts to rekindle that relationship as egypt has moved closer to the us and related to that is the decision or choice to downplay or take privately the human rights issues out of any desire to not want to alienate president sisi and then drive him closer to russiasenior administraton official so on the russia question i would say the united states is going to talk with egypt about any number of regional and international issues russia is obviously a country that is interested and involved in egypt the nature of those discussions i dont want to get ahead of that or say what it will be but there will be a number of regional and international topics that are discussedq  and the human rights issuesenior administraton official so i wouldnt look at it as  i wouldnt read too much into it the public or private nature of it these are issues that are important human rights has been an area weve talked about with egypt for a number of years and we will figure out the best way to discuss that to handle thatq  inaudiblesenior administraton official weve always done that in a number of waysq  two questions has there been by the administration any decision  i know there has been some consideration of designating the muslim brotherhood as a terrorist organization if theres talk of it  where has that conversation ended i imagine that will come up with at least sisi if not both leaders and on the issue of egypt aya hijazi the american who continues to be detained there will her case be specifically brought upsenior administraton official so the president is interested in hearing president alsisis views on the muslim brotherhood issue obviously that is one that has received a lot of attention we along with a number of countries have some concerns about various activities that the muslim brotherhood has conducted in the region but thats going to be a discussion that will unfold between us and egyptq  no decision by the administration yetsenior administraton official i dont want to get ahead of any process bilaterally or internally on that issue but it is something that we will likely be discussing with egypt q  and so is it safe to say then that that conversation continues within the administrationsenior administraton official i think its safe to say that that along with a number of issues about how we engage with egypt continues in the administrationq  and on hijazisenior administraton official on hijazi so of course were very aware of her case the most senior levels of the administration understand her situation the protection of us citizens in egypt and around the world is one of the highest priorities for the president and for the administration we are going to address this with egypt in a way that we think maximizes the chances her case will be resolved in a satisfactory mannerq  so not directly with sisisenior administraton official we will figure out the best way the raise this with the egyptian government to maximize the chances her case is resolved positivelyq  any reaction  i know its a background briefing  to this decision to allow new settlements in the occupied west bank and is this something that the president  how will the president bring this up particularly with king abdullah next weeksenior administraton official i think the discussion about the settlements is not one that we want to address at this time my office is deeply involved in that effort and working with both the israelis and the palestinians on that issue but we do not anticipate that becoming a focal point for any discussions over the next weekq  but you did say that the israelipalestinian topic would be generally a matter of discussion so if not settlements whats the discussionsenior administraton official we are not going to in this forum get into the specifics of the points that were going to be bringing up but we are going to be discussing the general outlines of our approach with the middle east peace process and provide information as to the context of what weve been doing over the last few weeks to advance the processsenior administration official i know theres going to be a lot of interest in the topic that has just been brought up i would urge you to  that there is a forum coming up here shortly in a few hours here where that will be  you can address that more directlygo aheadq  theres reports in the egyptian media that president sisi will bring with him a list of egyptians that he would like the trump administration to extradite to egypt is that something the president would be open tosenior administration official i think its hard to comment on something just based on reports in the egyptian press if that is conveyed we can talk with the egyptians about it but were not aware of any request coming so i wouldnt want to get too far ahead of ourselvesq  and hes also interested in changing some of the rules on the cash flow of the aid to reverse what president obama had donesenior administration official cashflow financingq  right is that something that trump is open tosenior administration official so again security cooperation is going to be something we talk about there are a number of ways that we can try and improve and enhance security cooperation us foreign military financing had traditionally been  billion a year thats a very large amount and that has contributed to egypts military preparedness the nature  the way we deliver that assistance is something that has always been a topic of discussion and will remain that well discuss with egypt whether cashflow financing is something they need or not but it is also something that would be a process of our internal budget discussions that are ongoing so we cant really get ahead of the budget planning nowq  there have been some discussions over the last couple of days about whether the us government position on assad in syria is that he has to leave power what is the current position of this white house and how do you expect that to be discussed during these meetingssenior administration official we are not going to address that issue at this forum that issue will be addressed im sure later in the day or in the very near future weve worked on that communication and it will be coming out as i said in the near futureq  so does the secretary of states comment still standsenior administration official im not going to address any of those issuesq  you said earlier that you anticipate the united states will continue to provide substantial foreign and military assistance to egypt the state department has said that egypt is one of the countries that would be impacted by the presidents cuts to foreign aid in his budget can you just clarify that is that something that they are likely to talk about in their meeting is that something that the white house is looking at and if so how much would be slashedsenior administration official the administration wants to fully support the needs and requirements and sustain the relationship in a very effective way the discussions about the details of the budget process and how thats going to be allocated with the input from the department of state is still an ongoing processq  had the prime minister expressed any concern about that ahead of this visit or any hope to address that in their meetingsenior administration official you mean president alsisi q  im sorry presidentsenior administration official so the egyptians have consistently made clear that the security assistance is important and it has been for us i anticipate that will be a topic of discussion with the egyptians what details we get into exactly i cant get ahead of that but im sure the egyptians will want to sustain a strong security assistance relationship q  several weeks ago the pentagon submitted a plan for defeating isis to president trump can you say how far along he is in reviewing that plan and do the contents of that do you expect those to come up in the meetings with either of these two leaderssenior administration official well have discussions with both leaders about our approach to defeating isis it will surely be of interest to president sisi and of course king abdullah the details about any progress in the plan we would defer to another time senior administration official i understand that you will have an event here in about four minutes so were going to wrap up to facilitate you making to it but

required by statute in order to extend the national emergency that the past administration declared the president believes that the significant cyberenabled activities continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to our national security and economic prosperity and therefore he has determined that it was necessary to continue this national emergencylast night a federal judge in hawaii put an indefinite hold on the presidents executive order that was issued on national security the department of justice is reviewing the ruling and is considering the best way to defend the presidents lawful and necessary orderthis ruling is just the latest step that will allow the administration to appeal just a week ago the us district court in the eastern district of virginia upheld the presidents order on the merits the white house firmly believes that this order is lawful and necessary and will ultimately be allowed to move forwardthis morning we announced that the president will

the president had a meeting with treasury secretary mnuchin the secretary along with the national economic council and the rest of the presidents team of experts have been meeting with and hearing from stakeholders on all sides of the tax reform debatetax reform has been a centerpiece of the presidents economic agenda from the beginning of his campaign the team is weighing the best option to develop a plan that will provide significant middleclass tax relief and make american businesses more competitiveenacting the first significant tax reform since the s is going to be a serious undertaking and we are at the first stages of this process beginning to engage with members of congress policy groups business leaders industry constituents from around the country and other stakeholderstax reform has been a part of the political discussion for years and accordingly lots of people have a lot of ideas about it we intend to hear from them he and his team will continue to meet with those who support and oppose the various policy options as they all are still on the table because the president is committed to delivering results that the american people and american businesses will be able to see and feel in their paycheckson the hill this morning the president was glad that the nominations of his secretary of agriculturedesignate governor sonny perdue and secretary of labordesignate advanced out of committee although he was disappointed to see that democratic senators who had previously expressed their support for alex acosta the labor secretarydesignee nonetheless while they had previously supported him seem to have stuck to a partyline vote the president looks forward to having them officially on the team and in the cabinet as soon as possiblealso this morning the department of commerce and first responder network authority firstnet announced that att will build the first nationwide wireless broadband a network dedicated to americas first responders this step was part of the  commissions recommendations on improving the ability of our police fire and emergency medical personnel to communicate seamlessly across jurisdictions which is critical to their missions its also a sign of the incredible ability of publicprivate partnerships to drive innovation and solve some of our biggest problems while also creating jobs and growing the economyback to the schedule this afternoon the president hosted a legislative affairs lunch on opioid and drug abuse the lunch was an opportunity to discuss the goals and agenda of the presidents commission on combatting drug addiction and the opioid crisis which he established yesterdaythe commission which is going to be chaired by new jersey governor chris christie is the next step in the presidents promise to the american people that he would take real action to keep drugs from pouring into our country and corrupting our communities under governor christies leadership and working closely with the white house office of american innovation the commission will bring together leaders on both sides of the aisle to find the best ways to treat and protect the american people from this epidemicmany members in attendance at the lunch played a key part in passing the bipartisan comprehensive addiction and recovery act also known as cara the first major federal addiction legislation in  years which authorized over  million to fight the opioid epidemic part of the mission of the presidents commission will be to ensure that those funds are spent efficiently and effectively too many lives are at stake to risk wasting any money on this effortmoving on later this afternoon the president will welcome prime minister rasmussen of denmark for a working visitwell have a readout on their bilateral meeting for you at its conclusiona couple followups from yesterday i know hunter asked about the house and the senate passage disapproving of the federal communications commissions regulations on privacy rules from last year so let me just expand on that a little and get to your questionthe white house supports congress using its authority under the congressional review act to roll back last years fcc rules on broadband regulation the previous administration in an attempt to treat internet service providers differently than edge providers such as google and facebook reclassified them as common carriers  much like a hotel or another retail outlet  and opened the door to an unfair regulatory framework this will allow all service providers to be treated fairly and consumer protection and privacy concerns to be reviewed on an equal playing fieldthe president pledged to reverse this type of federal overreach in which bureaucrats in washington take the interests of one group of companies over the interests of others picking winners and losersthe president has signed more legislation under the congressional review act ending jobkilling rules and regulations than all previous presidents combined already and he will continue to fight washington red tape that stifles american innovation job creation and economic growthjeff was here yesterday roberta is here now  but following up on jeffs question he asked about the administrations position on the paris climate treaty we are currently reviewing issues related to the agreement and expect to have a decision by the time of the g summit late mayish if not soonerbefore i take your questions i wanted to speak quickly about judge gorsuch again and the process behind his nomination and confirmation from the beginning i think the president has been clear and  percent transparent about his choices if he had been elected who he would choose from as a matter of fact id say that the level of transparency is probably unprecedented in modern times at leastduring the campaign he gave the american people a list of  judges which he would pick his choice for the supreme court from the american people sent him to the white house to nominate one of those judges  and he did it prior to the president making his final decision the white house spoke with  senators  more than half of whom were from the democrat side of the aisle including every democrat member of the senate judiciary committee  to seek their advice and consent on the nomination the consensus was that the presidents pick should be a respected mainstream judgeas ive laid out many times before from unanimous consent of the th circuit court of appeals to the extraordinarily low rate of majority opinions accompanied by dissent judge gorsuch is the definition of a mainstream respected judge he has offered the senate plenty of material to vouch for that since his nomination judge gorsuch met with nearly  senatorsin response to requests from the senate judiciary committee judge gorsuch provided the following over  pages of written answers about his personal records in response to  questions for the record by democrats on the committee the most in recent history which he submitted within six days of receiving the questions over  pages of documents including speeches case briefs opinions and written work going back as far as college and over  pages of email and paper records related to the judges time at the department of justicein fact the department of justice provided access to many documents that would normally be guarded by various privileges in a historically unprecedented move in the spirit of cooperation with senate democrats and the judge sat for three rounds and nearly  hours of questioning by the senate judiciary committee during which he was asked nearly  questions almost twice as many as justices sotomayor kagan or ginsburgthe white house and the judge did all of this in the hopes that senate democrats many of whom already had announced their intent to filibuster judge gorsuchs nomination would look beyond their political game and see for themselves how eminently qualified he is to sit on the supreme courtunfortunately it looks more and more like senate democrats would rather do all that they did in reading and questioning for nothing more than for political theaterfinally before i take your questions a letter was transmitted just recently to the ranking member and chairman of the house and senate intelligence committees that said in the ordinary course of business national security staff discovered documents that we believe are in response to your march   letter to the intelligence community seeking documents necessary to determine whether information collected on us persons was mishandled and leaked we have and will invite the senate and house ranking members and chairman up to the white house to view that material in accordance with their schedulewith that id be glad to take a few of your questionscherylq  thanks sean im trying to gauge the probability of a government shutdown at the end of april are your directions to the capitol hill to hold firm on the spending cuts that the president wants or to try to wheel and deal and get a bill that can keep the government openmr spicer i dont know that theyre mutually exclusive i think we want q  you wouldnt want pushback on capitol hill from some mr spicer there generally is but i think that we want both i think we want to maintain some of the spending priorities as well as some of the reductions in the  budget we want to do so responsibly and do so within the priorities that the president has laid outi think his funding requests and priorities are laid out in the budget that director mulvaney detailed and sent up for the remainder of  there are some key things in that and i think that it is going to begin a conversation that we will continue to have with the house and senate but i dont think both of those goals are mutually exclusive obviously we dont want the government to shut down but we want to make sure that were funding the priorities of the government john deckerq  thanks a lot sean i wanted to ask about some news that the president made today with a tweet that he put out on twitter he seemed to be picking a fight with the freedom caucus and the freedom caucus as you know has  members does the president realize how important this caucus is this coalition is in terms of passing a replacement bill for the affordable care act and passing the rest of his legislative agendamr spicer well of course he understands that the goal of all legislation is get to a majority in the house majority in the senate but at the end of the day he recognizes that he has a bold and robust agenda that he is trying to enact that he ran on and told the american people that he would do when he was president and hes going to get the votes from wherever he canq  can he pass that agenda without the help of the freedom caucusmr spicer well theres two questions one is i mean mathematically yes but secondly i think that theres a few members of the freedom caucus both prior to last fridays vote and since then who have expressed a willingness to want to work with him rather than necessarily as a bloc and i think that there continues to be some promising signs with thatso again i think part of is is that i think if people are more concerned with voting as a bloc than in whats in the best interests of their constituents and the american people hes hoping that people will see the bigger picture the goals that we outlined and sometimes not let the really good be the enemy of the perfectq  he seemed to imply in that tweet that he would be in favor of primarying some individuals in the freedom caucus who oppose his agenda is that correct did i read that correctlymr spicer im going to say  im going to let the tweet speak for itself for those of you who think  or just for your understanding it would be improper of me to discuss the election or defeat of any candidate from this podiummattq  thanks sean two questions if you dont mindmr spicer i want phenomenal questions from you q  thats what ill give you laughter first we know now mr spicer you get itq  no i got it laughter so two white house officials according to new york times reporting provided representative nunes with the information that he spoke about last week and according to the times the senior director for intelligence on the nsc who was hired by michael flynn started going through these documents after the presidents tweet  the wiretapping tweet so im wondering if the white house thinks its appropriate for national security officials to be conducting whats basically a political task which is trying to find information that then validates something the president said mr spicer so i read the report and respectfully i think your questions assumes that the reporting is correctq  it doesmr spicer and so i would just suggest to you that the letter that was submitted earlier to the ranking  the chairman and the ranking members of the two committees  two intelligence committees on the hill the reason that the white house has asked them to come up is to view that informationand again i dont want to get in front of that as ive said before we are not as obsessed with the process as much as the substance and i think that our goal is to make sure that the ranking members of both committees as well as the chairman see the information that  the materials that are important to this and then worry about the outcome at the end of thisq  and then on a different topic with ms walshs departure today are you expecting any more staffing shakeups in the west wingmr spicer nocatherineq  sean are you saying that the new york times reporting today is not correct on whoever was mr spicer im saying that in order to comment on that story would be to validate certain things that i am not at liberty to doq  for days you havent been able to tell us who he met with what the circumstances were mr spicer and i understand that and again and i think that there is an assumption as ive said before we cannot condone that  in the same way that you protect sources when i call you and say youve got  anonymous sources and you go well i cant reveal my sources chairman nunes in conducting an investigation and a review has an opportunity to have his sources our view was  is that the smart move was to make all the materials available to the chairman and the ranking member of the relevant committees and i understand the obsession with the process piece but we are focused on the substance of it and i think the goal is to make sure that people have the substance that are looking into this that we have asked to look into this q  so the white house did make materials available alreadymr spicer no no we have sent a letter within the past few hours to both of those committees informing them that we wanted to make that available to themq  and what kind of message do you think this sends to people watching this does it mr spicer i think it sends a message that we want them to look into this that i think that  as we have maintained from all along that i think theres a belief that the president has maintained that there was surveillance that occurred during the  election that was improper and that we want people to look into this and take the appropriate legal responsible steps to both understand it and then address itmajorq  i want to read to you something you said here at the podium on march rd when you were originally asked if the white house might have had any role in providing information to chairman nunes you first said it didnt make any sense to you and you went to say  and im quoting you here i dont know why he  chairman nunes  would brief the speaker and then come down here to brief us on something that we would have briefed him on it doesnt seem to make a ton of sense so im not aware of it but it doesnt really pass the smell testthere is now reporting  which i cant tell if youre disputing or not  that identifies two people within this white house as the sources of this information so im just trying to put these things together where you said it doesnt pass the smell test on march rd now theres reporting that suggests that it is within the white house that they were the sources of this im just trying to put those two things togethermr spicer all right so number one the first quote that youre reading if you actually go back i was responding to  i was very clear that i said based on what chairman nunes has said  the following doesnt make senseq  okay so within that  mr spicer but thats an important partq   im gathering that youve learned something new since then so please tell us what youve learnedmr spicer right and again  no no no because again major ive commented on this both yesterday and today that your obsession with who talked to whom and when is not the answer here it should be the substancein the same way that when you guys print a story with  anonymous sources your obsession is the substance it seems now that you continue to look at from a backwards prism which is what happened who drove in what gate who did they meet with what were they wearing that day as opposed to whats the underlying substance of this did something happen in the  election did leaks occur we are not going to engage actively in that kind of leaking that has been a problem in fact if you look at obamas deputy assistant secretary of defense that is out there evelyn farkas she made it clear that it was their goal to spread this information around that they went around and did this and she said thats why there are so many leaksthey have admitted on the record that this was their goal  to leak stuff and they literally  she said on the record trumps team there are serious questions out there about what happened and why and who did it and i think thats really where our focus is in making sure that that information gets outq  but cant the process from your vantage point validate the importance of the substancemr spicer well i think theres a review that weve asked for probably q  and youve told us that youre willing to look into and ask questions about the process and provide us answers thats all im trying to  mr spicer no no no  no dont  please dont put words in my mouth i never said i would provide you answers i said we would look into itthe responsible thing for us to do is to provide the individuals and the committees who are doing the review the materials that theyre looking for  or some of them we dont know how many  what theyre exactly looking for what theyve seen and what they haventour goal is to be as forthright as possible they asked the intelligence communities and others in a march letter for information we are willing to provide them with the information that we have  the materials that we have come across and i think that is an important stepagain it is not  our obligation is to make sure the review is done both in the house and the senate as we asked for a few weeks ago not to make sure that we illegally leak out information to you q  and when you say we have information are you disputing the reports in the new york timesmr spicer im not commenting on the reports major i just got asked the same questionq  but youre saying we so im just trying to find out theyre naming some people that work for the nsc who work at this white house mr spicer no no no im saying  no we meaning the white house is not going to start confirming q   who have been named now publicly for the first timemr spicer i get it we are not going to start commenting on oneoff anonymous sources that publications publishq  if it were wrong would you tell usmr spicer im not going to get into it as ive just said i get it how many times you can ask the same questionhunterq  thank you sean i have two questions the first president trump is pushing for a major tax cut increases in defense and infrastructure spending and the border wall does he think this agenda has to be deficitneutral or is he open to plans that might initially add to the debtmr spicer well i think when it comes to tax reform hes got three underlying goals one is tax simplification two is to lower the rates and three is to grow jobs and the economy and i think part of it is is that if you look at it dynamically as the plan develops  and again as i mentioned earlier were not there yet we are beginning that process of engaging with stakeholders as the plan develops and theres a cost put on it thats going to be a decision that gets looked at as well as what are the economic growth and jobcreation aspects to it so to answer that question without knowing what the full scope of it is is looking at something and answering it in a vacuumq  and then just to clarify one thing with the new york times story i know you wont identify congressman nunes as sources but isnt it abundantly clear that at least some white house officials had to be involved in him getting information here because they would need to help them access the complexmr spicer i cannot get into who those individuals wereq  right but it was someone at the white house rightmr spicer well again its  again if i start going down the path of confirming and denying one thing that were going down a very slippery slope ive made our position very clear on thatjessicaq  thank you sean thank you for announcing the visit of the chinese president i have a couple of questions about that visit if youd entertain me can you talk about the location and how it was chosen for this visitmr spicer there is as you can imagine on any trip no matter who the foreign leader is theres a lot of discussion that goes back and forth between the white house the state department and the equivalents of the other head of governments their appropriate counterparts and those are the kind of things that go back and forth in terms of how long the activities what will be discussed every single thing is discussed on both sides and so that was a long and ongoing negotiation with the government of china and with their representatives lasting several weeks nowq  so how did you arrive at maralago as opposed to the white housemr spicer im not going to get into the back and forth i would just suggest to you that both sides discussed various locations and topics and agendas and length et cetera and aspects to the trip and this is what weve arrived atq  so what is the goal for the white house to accomplish during the visit mr spicer well i think theres a few things one is i think this is an opportunity for president trump to develop a relationship in person with president xi hes spoken to him on the phone a few times but we have big problems and  i mean everything from the south china sea to trade to north korea there are big issues of national and economic security that need to get addressed and i think theres going to be a lot on the table when it comes to that over the two days that they will talk q  and lastly the chinese are expecting the white house to provide some sort of framework for the relationship to be viewed for are you prepared for that and can you talk a little bit about what that framework might bemr spicer can you expand on that a littleq kind of put a floor under the relationship looking for how to view the relationship obviously you had the rebalance and the pivot in the prior administration is there a tagline or a vision for uschina relations that you will roll out during this visitmr spicer well see im not  if you have any hashtags let me know but i think right now were not worried so much about slogans as much as progress theres a lot of big things that we need to accomplish with china and i think that we will work on themkristenq  thanks sean did the president direct anyone in this white house or in his national security team to try to find information or intelligence to back up his assertion about wiretappingmr spicer i dont  im not aware of anything directly id have to look into that in terms of  again theres two sides to this one is the information side and two is the policy and the activities and the legal piece of what happened and i dont  those are big buckets if you willq  so its possiblemr spicer im not going to comment on itq  and one more dont sort of the daily questions about this make it necessary to have some type of outside independent investigation to lift any lingering cloud that there may bemr spicer no q  whymr spicer i think you have two committees looking into this the fbi has been looking into this as they mentioned at the hearing i mean how many do you want i understand that you may not have q  do you think the house intelligence investigation is still valid given all of these questionsmr spicer how is it not valid im asking q  there are all these questions about where devin nunes got his information from was it politically motivated to lift that cloud would it not be smart to have an outside independent investigationmr spicer no  well again i think you got the fbi probably other intelligence committees that looked   of them issued a report earlier in terms of involvement in the  election and then youve got two congressional committees looking into itso im not really sure the exact need i think that people are doing  i understand sometimes theres a need for you guys to have more information and more sources i think this is being done in a responsible way where people are being discussed  what they know at an appropriate classification level and information is being sharedq  can you just quickly talk about the timing of inviting the leaders of this investigation to the white house now is it because of this report why not do that initiallymr spicer i think a couple things one is they asked  they tasked the various committees in midmarch to  or the agencies rather to provide information we felt we had information that was relevant and i think there was some  theres a desire to make sure that both sides of the aisle who are looking into this as well as both chambers had that information anitaq  eric trump gave an interview a few days ago to forbes magazine in which he said that he would update his father regularly perhaps quarterly on the business including giving profitability reports so i had two questions about that one is have they spoken about the business since january and two how does this not violate what the president set out as the protocols for how he would deal with the business mr spicer well two things i dont know if theyve spoken its not  this may be a question better directed to the trump organization but secondly i think everything that hes done is in accordance with what the counsels office and the ethics folks q  just following up i believe he said the he wasnt going to talk to his children his sons about the business so how is that q  again i think everything that is being done in terms of reports or updates is being done in a consultation with the counsels office so i think thats justinq  i have two things i want to ask the first is just to follow up on major and ask about the substance its sort of unclear what you guys are telling the chairman and the ranking members you have is it information that would validate the presidents claims about surveillance during the  campaign or is it information about their broader russia investigation im trying to mr spicer again im not here to share that thats why weve invited them up to view it in a classified setting in an appropriate setting its not to be shared with people that dont have the appropriate clearances and access to q  but youre not intending to imply that this is the information that chairman nunes has been talking aboutmr spicer no what im suggesting is that there has been information that has been  material that has been made come to light and that we want to make sure that the people who are conducting the review have that information have access to itq  and then westinghouse center filed for bankruptcy yesterday im wondering if thats prompted national security concerns in the administration and if there is any effort within the administration to sort of help them navigate this bankruptcy considering that the mr spicer ill have to check on that i think theres obviously a couple departments that would be interested in thatsteveq  sean i just want to ask you to elaborate more on what you have so far told us you said that in the ordinary course of business the national security staff discovered documents can you explain how these documents were uncovered what does it mean in the course of businessmr spicer i dont think  no im not thats why weve invited them up into a classified setting is for them to see these materials and understand it this is not the setting that is appropriate to discuss that q  so who in the national security staff then uncovered the documentsmr spicer good question that is not  again as ive mentioned multiple times were not here to go through the process our job is to get to the substance of this and to make sure that the people who have the appropriate access and authority to look into this matter and then take appropriate stepsq  are you in a position right now to deny or rule out the possibility that members of the national security staff have already informed the chairman of the house intelligence committeemr spicer im not going to get into any further details on this i would just suggest to you  again if i can go back for a second to something that the obama administrations deputy assistant secretary of defense noted very clearly on the record that they were engaged in an effort to spread information about trump officials that had come up in intelligence thats not  that is several networks evelyn farkas made that proclamation about what was going on during the obama administration regarding the trump team so that is something that they made very clear on the recordjohnq  a couple of things sean first of all on the freedom caucus in response to the presidents tweet congressman amash of michigan responded on camera saying most people dont like to be bullied  in response to the president  also saying that sending out such tweets is constructive in the th grade and it may allow a child to get his way but thats not how government works could you take a moment to respond to congressman amash was the president trying to bully the freedom caucusmr spicer no i think this is consistent with everything that he has said since friday of last week and i think that he is looking for members on both sides of the aisle who want to be constructive to achieve the goal of a patientcentered healthcare system thats it plain and simpleand i think that his comments and his tweets speak for themselves with respect to how he feels and whyq  following on that is this a divideandconquer strategymr spicer no its a math strategy which is to get to  and pass an effort and continue to move the agenda forwardq  and then if i could following on what major said youve accused people in this room several times of being more interested in the process than actually in substance of things but when information is discovered by the intelligence committee chairman in the house at the white house that is potentially exculpatory to what the president has tweeted out and its reported that one of the people who was involved in uncovering that information is a white house staff member who was kept in his position over the request of the national security advisor by the political leadership here at the white house does the process not then take on some relevancemr spicer well the process in the sense that we are  as ive noted we have invited the chairman and the ranking members who are looking into this and reviewing the matter up here that doesnt mean that we allow uncleared members from the media to come in and look at it that means q  im not asking that questionmr spicer no you are you said q  no im not asking that questionmr spicer but i think it is because q  thats not what i asked what i asked was when you have that connection of dots all the way along does the process the prominence of this information not become relevant to the overall investigationmr spicer its for the people who are conducting the review to decide that not for the people in this room to decide it it is up to the people who are cleared to look at that information and that material to look at it and make their evaluations and i think they are conducting their review youve seen very clearly both on the house side and then starting today on the senate side them looking into this matter that is the appropriate venue forum and personnel to be reviewing it plain and simpleq  sean a quick follow up on thatmr spicer zekeq  you mentioned a couple of times mr spicer zekeq  thank you has the president already been briefed on this information mr spicer im sorry i couldnt hear youq  has the president been briefed on this information that youre now inviting the congressional committee chairs to come in and view and when was he briefed on itmr spicer i will look into that im not entirely sure when or what the status of that is but i can follow up on thatq  so then why would you brief  why would the white house brief congressional mr spicer i understand the question like i said i will look into whether or not  where that stands blakeq  sean thanks a couple on taxes the timeline here had been healthcare first tax reform second there was a fox poll out released yesterday that said  percent of americans want tax reform to happen this year with healthcare now at least being on hold is healthcare the numberone priority for this administration  is tax reform the numberone priority for this administration at this point or is healthcare still kind of taking up some of the oxygenmr spicer well i dont know that its taking up oxygen i think theres plenty of oxygen for both to go on i think the president would still like to see it done but i think theres no reason that we cant  i mean if you look at the timeline for tax reform youre talking several months and so i think the process is beginning on that and i think you can have a dualtrack strategy its not an eitheror propositionq  and you described what was going on with the meeting today as the first phase can you lay out to us what is somewhat entailed with that first phase is the president being given detailed strategies or is it broad principles what is involved in this first phasemr spicer i think its a little of both theyre talking about the process that they intend to partake  how this is going to lay out who theyre engaging with how theyre going to begin that process and then some of the guiding principles in making sure that any updates that he has or any principles that he wants to suggest are incorporated into that plan as they begin to meet with stakeholders but part of this is to levelset with him as to what they intend to do and how they intend to do itq  and you just mentioned a dual track between healthcare and tax reform but then theres also infrastructure hanging out there so can all of those go togethermr spicer lots of tracks i mean again remember theyre not all the same people some of them overlap some of them dont but i think part of this is is that you got to remember that some things can happen sooner than others because of the legislative calendar some things are going to take longer because of both the legislative calendar and because of the number of individuals involved and the complexity of the situation but theres a lot of things that can be moving at once because of how theyll play outjohn gizziq  thank you sean turning to the foreign front yesterday vladimir karamurza the twicepoisoned russian dissident and vicechairman of the open russia movement testified before a senate appropriations subcommittee backing continued sanctions against russia he also called on secretary of state tillerson to meet with russian civil society members in other words antiputin dissidents like himself  when he makes his trip to moscow next monthmr karamurza also said he was meeting with many members of congress of both parties but he would be very happy to meet with any administration officials are there any plans for the president or anyone in the white house to meet with mr karamurza and will mr tillerson meet with the russian civil societymr spicer i would suggest to you  im not aware of anything both the national security council as well as the state department are probably more appropriate for you to address that toalexisq  sean can i ask a question  but before i do get some clarification on the answer that you gave to hunter and to major i thought it was just yesterday that you said that when you were asked who cleared in chairman nunes that you had asked some preliminary questions and not gotten answers and that you would continue to ask mr spicer yeahq  so my question today is you know the answers to that and you are saying you will not answer that question today or you dont knowmr spicer no no thats not  right so what im saying to you is is that the decision that has been made is to bring in all the relevant individuals that are reviewing the situation and make them available that getting into sources and process is not the proper way to conduct this review and we want the people who are conducting it to understand more fully the materials  not necessarily who came in what time and whatever q  so youre  just to clarify again you asked the questions you were not given answersmr spicer no no thats  im just saying that q  you said yesterday you asked that  wait let me finish you said yesterday that you asked you didnt get the answers and so what youre telling us today is you are never going to get the answer  you yourself  you are never going to get the answer to who cleared in chairman nunesmr spicer what im saying is is that the decision was made  its supposed to focus on the process to focus on the substance and that the decision was made q  youre not answering my questionmr spicer i let you ask the question so let me answer it pleaseand the answer that im giving you is that the decision was made internally to focus on the individuals who are doing the review both republicans and the democrats house and senate and have them come in and look at the materials thats what the focus should be alexiskaitlanq  wait wait wait heres my bigger question the president has expressed his affirmation his support for the finding that russia interfered with the  election that is the centerpiece of the investigation at the fbi and the senate intelligence committee my question is  can you update us what is the president doing now in the administration to respond to director comeys testimony that that interference is not just electionyearbased but continuingmr spicer youre talking about the executive order is that correctq  i just asked can you update what is the administration doing to prevent that to mr spicer so okay q   to respond to that preliminary finding already that we already know that it is continuing mr spicer well so the executive order that the president signed that continues the national emergency deals with looking into malicious attempts and cyber attempts to come into the united states thats what the executive order that he signed wasq  thats the sum total of the response so farmr spicer well im not going to get into whats being done behind the scenes in terms of the intelligence and law enforcement community but the bottom line is that there was an emergency declared with respect to challenges that the united states faces from a variety of actors outside the united states to come in and use cyber techniques to hack the united states the national emergency will continue under the president to address the threats that we face from abroad and from a variety of places aprilq  sean q  wait no i was just going to q  seanmr spicer april q  yes sean mr spicer well get to you laughter q  he called on someone else im sorry go ahead and then come back to memr spicer okay ill do kaitlan and then april im sorryq  she can go first but ill just go after hermr spicer okay laughter q  okay thank you kaitlan so sean what is the ultimate goal of the leaders coming in to get this information and will it be information that nunes received plus or will it just be basically a synopsis of a synopsis of what nunes receivedmr spicer well its going to be the materials that are relevant to the discussion in the area that theyre reviewing and thats up to them to decide the relevancy of that i think we have from the national security committee has gone into  come upon some materials that they want to share with them its up to them to make a decision about the relevance of those documents and what they would lead them to believe but theres two issues here one april is what do they see and then what do they want to see in addition to that or as a result of those materials right so in other words they may see things and say hey this is interesting i wonder if theres a pattern this is interesting i want to see more or they may come to a conclusion right awaybut thats part of the idea of  to the first part of your question  in sharing information with them is to allow the members of both of the committees on a bipartisan basis to come in to review materials that we think are relevant to the issues that the president talked about with respect to surveillance the masking  unmasking of individuals the handling of it et cetera et cetera and then its up to those members to decide what to do with that information how to explore that more in depthq  so ultimately in their questioning they could actually wind up reviewing what nunes received possibly if they do even ask different questions just sitting in the intelligence meetings like the president does  if he decides to give more hell give moremr spicer it depends i think thats possible i dont want to prejudge what they ask and what comes in response to it it also has to do with what documents we have they may go down a particular trail and have to follow up with an agency and say we saw this can we see a followup on that as you saw from many reports the nsa has been asked to provide documentation to the house my understanding from the reports is that that was ongoing and maybe some of the materials that they see prompt them to ask additional questionsbut thats part of providing it to them its an ongoing review and what we want is for them to see these materials and come to conclusions or need more information to come to conclusions but this is part of that review processq  are they allowed to  the type of briefing with their ranking and who they are  no matter if they may be head of the intel committee are some of these other members allowed to see the same things that he sees even though they are not head of  i mean are they allowed to see thatmr spicer my understanding would be that they wouldq  okay and lastly sean do you know who allowed him to come inmr spicer noq  you dont knowmr spicer nokaitlanq  i have two questions for you one is did anyone in the white house ever raise the possibility of a cabinet position or a top intelligence post later on in the administration for devin nunesmr spicer not that im awareq  and secondly will the president hold a press conference so he can answer questions on the surveillance claims and all these intelligence revelations himselfmr spicer im not good enoughq  not that youre not good enough but hes the one who made the claims you didnt make the claims he made the claimsmr spicer i will convey your request to him i know that as ive said before well see im sure that at some point  he enjoyed the last one so much q  tomorrowmr spicer is that what youd like tomorrowq  that worksmr spicer does that work for you laughter okay well let me see what i can come up withceciliaq  i just want to clarify do you believe  from what you know about these materials do they validate the presidents wiretapped claimmr spicer i dont know i have not seen the materials it is members of the national security committee who have come across these documents that want to make them available to the members who are leading the reviewq  and why not just be more forthcoming about this entire process of who let nunes in if this was enough  if the president of the united states could tweet this claim about wiretapping doesnt the american public have a right to know moremr spicer yes they do and i think thats why were going through a process and i say this respectfully  i understand that you want all the process answers  what day did they come in what were they wearing what door did they come in the relevant questions are about the substance of this and its interesting  i dont get the same thing when i see these unpublished stories with anonymous sources you dont ever tell me who your sources were who q  because youre mr spicer glenn im actually asking cecilias question  if you could be as polite as not to interrupt herq  im sorrymr spicer thank youdo you accept his apologyq  one hundred percent laughter mr spicer thats very q  in fact i will cede the floor to glennmr spicer thank you thats not how it works though but i would argue that you guys have  when you write a story and you call and say i have four anonymous sources that say whatever and i say okay well who are the sources and where are they coming  you go sorry im not revealing anything to you but the substance that im asking you to respond to  well when the shoe is on the other foot youre all about the processthe bottom line is that there are two congressional committees that are conducting reviews of this situation and those committees are looking at the relevant information and talking to the relevant peopleto your point about the process we have made individuals available and encouraged individuals to testify or to meet with or to discuss that have been approached so i think that what we are doing is frankly  and i know you probably disagree but i think we are doing the responsible thing by making sure that documents and materials are shown to people with the appropriate classifications in the appropriate settings and that the people that the different committees would like to discuss these matters with are made available to them i think thats the responsible way of handling thisq  sean thank you very much i have two questions one on venezuela and another one on climate policy with respect to venezuela because today the supreme court of venezuela said they would take  try to take over the congress powers and the opposition said a coup is underway do you consider there is a coup underway in venezuela and what can we expect the united states to doand the other question is on climate change because president obama signed also the bilateral climate deals with brazil china and india and what do you have to thosemr spicer well on the first one respectfully i would send you to the  i would refer you to the state department the only supreme court im really focused on right now is ours and getting judge neil gorsuch confirmed by the senate so id be glad  i think the state department is more of an appropriate venue to discuss the activities over thereand second i think when it comes to things like the paris treaty as i mentioned at the outset that is being q  those are separate mr spicer i understand but i think that there are things that we will have updates for on all of these things as we move forward right now ive got nothing on that subjectyesq  thank you sean the wall street journal reported this morning that the trump administration is proposing more modest changes to nafta like for example theyre leaving the arbitration panel that deals with trade disputes in place et cetera et cetera is the white house backing away from some of the more sweeping changes to nafta that the president proposed during the campaignmr spicer i would just argue that robert lighthizer isnt even nominated yet that is not a statement of administration policy at this point there is nothing in those documents that we are confirming  or in that report rather that we are confirming that is not a statement of administration policy that is not an accurate assessment of where we are at this timeand i think our goal is to get robert lighthizer appointed as the next ambassador and us trade representative and then when we have that we will have plenty of updates on where we go with respect to nafta and the rest of our trade agreementwith that im going to say goodbye i will see you tomorrow thank you  oh im sorry i promised two days in a row q  thank you ive got one on foreign policy and one on domestic policy first one is many republicans were very critical about how president obama had handled the iranian green revolution about six years ago so my question is if mass protests across russia develop into a movement is this something that  what does the administration feel its role should be regarding thatmr spicer im not going to  thats a hypothetical question to talk about what would happen and if q  no its not mr spicer i know but when it comes to protests we obviously encourage as we did last sunday the peaceful protest  the government of russia to allow the peaceful protest of individuals throughout their country we obviously support the people to have a voice in every government throughout the worldq  and on the subject of partisanship and obstructionism whose responsibility does the president feel it is to put an end to partisanship and who needs to be reaching out to whom collectivelymr spicer i think its a twoway street i think part of it is that we  the president and the first lady extended an invitation the other night for everyone to come i think we were excited to see a third of senate democrats come i wish we had seen more theres an opportunity i think to engage in a discussion about some of the issues and come together but i would argue that when you look at this fight on gorsuch there are  i dont disagree with the fact that if youre a democrat you probably dont necessarily agree with some of the rulings and some of the philosophies of judge gorsuch i get that but at the end of the day they have always agreed  in fact in most cases the filibuster has never been the norm it hasnt and it is odd to see that these individuals who have  its one thing to vote no its one thing to say that we dont agree but to now turn to filibustering or threatening to filibuster senate  unbelievably qualified people and there is nobody that im aware of even on the left that is suggesting that judge gorsuch isnt qualified to serve as a supreme court justicerepublicans in the past have allowed democrat presidents to have their nominees voted on up or down and for the most part when you go back to president obama president clinton they have been  republicans have joined with democrats to allow people who are qualified to go onto the court and to see this new precedent be formed by leader schumer is disappointing because this is a huge huge crack i think there was a column  one of the papers today i think  you are really fundamentally changing how the senate is going to operate by doing this and i think thats an important  they can disagree with him philosophically i get that but when you have an election you can assume that a republican president is going to choose republicans for appointments and for federal judgeships and the democrats will do the same with their time in office but it was obamas nominees that got through all with republican support and its difficult to understand why when youve got someone as eminently qualified as gorsuch that this is the state that they want to drive and i think it further sets a partisan divide in our country when we cant allow people who are qualified and universally so to get on the benchq  should it not be done from the presidents side to try to mr spicer i think so sure but i think its a twoway street i would ask you what is  i remember a few years ago there was all this talk about from the getgo of obama  democrats sic made hay about how they wanted to see him as a oneterm president ive seen a similar tactic from democrats now about how they want to defeat him they want to stop his agenda and theres no sense of them wanting to work with this presidentso at some point i think we have shown a willingness to bring them together its amazing how many senators when you talk to them over the course of the last almost  days have said you know ive been to the white house more in the last  days of a trump administration than i was during eight years of an obama administration and i think that that speaks to the presidents desire to bring people together and to find common ground on areas of mutual agreement where we can move the country forwardthank you ill see you tomorrow end pm edt ,20728.490234,-65.26953100000172,-0.003148783643342393,5914.339844,-2.599610000000212,-0.00043954356167704377,2368.060059,-5.340087999999923,-0.0022550475355151978

2017-03-29,Remarks by President Trump in Listening Session on Opioids and Drug Abuse  ,cabinet room am edtthe president hello everybody thank you for being here with us this morning during my campaign i promised to take action to keep drugs from pouring into our country and i want to just thank secretary kelly hes done an amazing job down  percent at the border right now in terms of people and the drugs that are being stopped it will take longer and theres great cooperation with mexico and others but were doing a good joband we want to help those who have become so badly addicted drug abuse has become a crippling problem throughout the united states drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death in our country and opioid overdose deaths have nearly quadrupled since  this is a total epidemic and i think its probably almost untalked about compared to the severity that were witnessingtoday were bringing together leaders from inside our government and outside of our government and courageous people who have been affected  and really affected  by this terrible affliction in a joint campaign we want to battle drug addiction and combat opioid and we have to do it  a crisiswere fortunate to have governor chris christie with us a friend of mine  a great friend of mine  a very very early endorser  in fact an immediate endorser  once he got out of the race laughter he liked himself more than he liked me laughter but other than that governor christie i still do sir but thats all right laughter the president other than that hes been great and hes a very effective guy i will tell you  to have you working on this  and a great moment actually if people remember was you talking about your friend that was probably your greatest moment during the campaign for president and it showed how much you knew about this issue so thank you very much chris well work directly with representatives from state and local governments law enforcement medical professionals and victims i especially want to thank pam garozzo  wheres pam hi pam how are you  for being here pam sadly lost her son beautiful boy to drug addiction and pam we mourn your terrible loss and we honor your strength and the fact that youre here and he will not have died in vain okay well make sure  he will not have died in vain so thank you pam we appreciate itwere also thankful to welcome aj solomon and vanessa vitolo both of whom have fought addiction and are now symbols of hope and recovery right good job we must get our citizens to help and we need help everybody has to help and we will not have to go through what pam has gone through and so many other families in this country have gone through we want to help people like aj and vanessa who struggled through the dark depths of addiction not easy not easy and they found this bright promise of recovery we wish to also focus on prevention and law enforcement which is why ive issued previous executive actions to strengthen law enforcement and dismantle criminal cartels drug cartels have spread their deadly industry across our nation and the availability of cheap narcotics  the cheap narcotics  some of it comes in cheaper than candy  has devastated our communities its really one of the biggest problems our country has and nobody really wants to talk about it vice president pence mentioned this coming into the room he said this is a problem like nobody understands and i think theyre going to start to understand it and more importantly we have to solve the problemour attorney general jeff sessions is working very hard on this problem it takes a lot of his time because this causes so much of the problem that you have to solve  that problemso solving the drug crisis will require cooperation across government and across society including early intervention to keep americas youth off this destructive path we must work together trust each other and forge a true partnership based on the common ground of cherishing human life so this is a very very important meeting and maybe well go around the room and well just say hello to everybody so we all know who we are and then the press will leave and well start talking general sessions we know who you are go ahead secretary devos betsey devos secretary of educationsecretary shulkin david shulkin secretary of the vams garozzo pam garozzo parent of carlosmr solomon aj solomon thanks for introducing me mr presidentms vitolo vanessa thank you so much for having mesecretary kelly secretary kelly homeland securitydr wright don wright acting assistant secretary for healthmr rosenberg chuck rosenberg i run the deamr baum richard baum acting director of the office of national drug control policyms madras bertha madras harvard medical schoolms bondi pam bondi attorney general of floridamr rivera mariano rivera founder of the mariano rivera foundationthe president oh they could use you now laughter you know i think youd make  million a year right i tell you i watched for many years mariano id sit with george and george always felt good when mariano was mr rivera thats rightthe president he threw the heaviest pitch any time i dont know  you made the ball like  it weighed  pounds rightmr rivera something like that the president how about the broken bats laughter how many broken bats mr rivera too manythe president those bats used to crack right thank you great honor and jared thank you and chris chris why dont you say a few wordsgovernor christie mr president first to the president and the vice president thank you so much for focusing on this issue as you know mr vice president as the governor of indiana for four years this issue causes enormous pain and destruction to everyday families in every state in this country and thats why mr president i thought it was so important to bring pam and aj and vanessa here today for you meet them and hear directly from them their stories im just so honored that the president would ask me to take on this task with the group that we put together and im thrilled to work with the attorney general as well on the issues of prevention and interdiction of drugs so we dont get people hooked in the first placebut the most important thing to me is i think the president and i both agree that addiction is a disease and its a disease that can be treated and that we need to make sure we let people know  the president talked about how folks dont talk about it we talked about cancer we talk about heart disease we talk about diabetes and were not afraid to talk about it but people are afraid and ashamed to talk about drug addiction and while they dont talk about it we lose lives  lives of good people in the end the president ended by saying  talking about life and he and i are both prolife the difference with the president and i is were prolife for the whole life not just for the nine months in the womb but for the whole life every life is an individual gift from god and no life is irredeemable and people make mistakes  we all have the people who mistakes of drug use  and it is a mistake  we cant throw their life away the president and i believe that every life is an individual gift from god and is preciousand i think thats why it was such an important issue to him in the campaign and why im so honored to work with a president who understands the value of life and the value of second chances and thats what this commission i hope is going to be about to be able to give he and the vice president the best suggestions we possible can about how to have a national fight against this epidemicmr president thank you for your confidence in all of us and thank you for your supportthe president thank you very much maybe vanessa you can tell a little bit of your story were so proud of youms vitolo dont put me on the spot but  laughter  so first of all i would like to take this opportunity to thank you so much to brining this whole platform to a national level you are literally  everyone at this table is saving lives there are people dying every single day and its heartbreaking and governor christie i need you to know that i draw so much strength and courage from you standing up for people that had nearly given up completely thats extraordinary i come from a small town in south jersey my aunt is a teacher and she taught me the importance of education my uncle is a firefighter he taught me the importance of law and order i went to a private high school i was a cheerleader i went to college where i joined a sorority after i left college i had an injury and was prescribed pain killers and so quickly it took off from there i didnt know anything about heroin i was never warned  not that its anybody elses fault i take full responsibilitythe president so this all began very innocently with an injuryms vitolo absolutely yes  with a prescription of pain killersthe president and what was it what was the drug they gavems vitolo percocetthe president  i seems vitolo and then from percocet it went to oxy and then from oxy it went to heroin because it is definitely like you said more accessible and so much cheaper very quickly i lost everything i was homeless i chose to be homeless i was living on the streets of atlantic city i was in and out of jail and i was lucky enough to see some kind of light where i became a drug court participant  a drug court system that we have in new jersey which saved my life they sent me to a longterm treatment facility integrity house in new jersey and they saved my lifethe president how hard was that getting off this horrible stuff how hard was it for youms vitolo physically it was so hard and i felt that was the hardest part but then a couple of months later comes the psychological aspect of it and you still think that you need it because youre still not as happy when youre happy youre still not as sad you have no feelings its like youre a shell and it takes over your whole life  to choose to be homeless instead of live with your parents to choose not to speak to your family the president and what did your parents say during this whole process because im looking at you youre like allamerican  perfect youre a perfect person and im saying its hard to believe that youre living on the streets ms vitolo well it was so hard for my family my mom would drive the streets of atlantic city begging people to find me she couldnt find me i was that lost in every aspect of the word in jail  like i said i was sent to integrity house and they saved my life they gave me a second chance at life and from there i went to a halfway house i got a job where i quickly moved up im now a manager got my own apartment im graduating drug court this year and its amazing the opportunities that have been given to me im sitting across from you right now laughter three years ago i didnt have a place to live and today im here to represent the light that can be born out of the defeat of this darkness there is hope and there is a tomorrow and there is a day after that you just have to fight for it and people have to know that theres people fighting for them too because you give up there comes a point where you feel as if you have nothing you already ruined everything so theres no point to get sober but im here to show you that there is hope you can get better there is a better way and there is a better life and i wish i could tell you the heartbreak that i feel with the people that are overdosing every day and dying and the families that have to go through that suffering  because there is no need we can help somebody we can change this and thats the most amazing thing ive ever been a part of in my whole life and i would like to thank each and every one of you for giving me this opportunity it means the world to me it is my life i used to think that being an addict was my downfall but look at me im here today its obviously made me a stronger and better person the president incredible story thank you very much applause amazing amazing job thank you very much vanessa and well talk to you in a little while aj and i know how successful your father is and what a great man he is so that also put pressure on you in a different way rightmr solomon yeah well i didnt end up going into politics so  laughter the president dont do it laughter mr solomon so vanessa really spelled it out but i grew up in a little town in south jersey called haddonfield its a picturesque town really good schools my dad now is a supreme court justice in the state of new jersey thank you for the appointment governor laughter and my mom also serves in state government and i grew up i was a good student i was an athlete and i found alcohol and other drugs and i was probably well on my way to having an issue but then i found oxycontin my dad got in an accident and i decided that it would be a good idea to try it and thats really where my story startedthe president immediately hooked because i hear so much about oxycontin were you immediately hookedmr solomon yeah when i did my first one i remember doing it and thinking this is how i want to live the rest of my life i was always searching for something outside of myself that would make me feel better people think the drug is the problem and to some extent its accessibility is but addiction is a disease that i always had and just had to be unlocked and thats what i feel oxycontin did for me and when that happened  you know now im a brother and a son and a business owner  i own a treatment center which is awesome and i love it im so happy i went that route instead of  i was on track  i was on the governors advance team not that i didnt love it laughter but i really enjoy what i do helping other alcoholics and addicts back then i was the president do you have still an alcohol problem mr solomon i dont drink i dont do any drugsthe president but that was  you could see you were going to have that problem but you found this oxycontinmr solomon yes and i was a thief and a liar and i ended up homeless different story  my parents did not want me home i was living out of my car and then i ended up going to a longterm treatment center and i accepted what i was that i was an addict and i would rather have died than live with that so i left my plan was to kill myself i wasnt able to get home so i surrendered and a lot of people dont believe this part of the story  and whatever someones conception of god or a higher power is i got on my knees on a shuttle back to treatment i hadnt used and i said god either please just let me die  because my plan was to shoot myself i didnt have a gun  let me die or just let me get this and i swear to you that that obsession that vanessa talked about to use was lifted that day and my goal now in life is to help another alcoholic and an addict and i think  back then i would have rather died than had this disease but now a normal person can be miserable and they can be angry and resentful and thats just how theyll live their life me if i get angry resentful if im miserable ill drink and then ill do dope  heroin and then i will die so im gratefulthe president but not  not anymore rightmr solomon i dont have  im not allowed to be miserable i have to be trying to get the most out of life normal people dont have that they wont die if they dont do that so im grateful that i am what i am yes i guess thats itthe president thats an amazing story how did you get off it how did you get  did you go to a center or something or what happenedmr solomon i did i went in the mountains in arizona to this place and i was only coming off of opiates and they said  it was this tall guy ill never forget  his name was bird  he said what are you coming off of i said opiates he said you dont need detox youll feel like youre going to die but you wont die and they put me in the center and i detoxed cold turkey and the president and what was that like mr solomon its like  times worse than the flu but the anxiety is the worst part the suicidal ideations crawling out of your skin i mean if i had drugs in front of me i would have done themthe president so he was right mr solomon oh yeah yeah he was rightthe president but you got through it how long did that takemr solomon two weeksthe president it was two weeks of  they used to call it cold turkey right mr solomon cold turkeythe president do they still do that mr solomon yeah the president no way so you went through two weeks of that and that was hellmr solomon yesthe president but then you knew you were going to get bettermr solomon no then the mental obsession came and i wanted to use so badly but i had accepted what i was and i knew i couldnt so i wanted the obsession to stop i wanted my brain to stop yelling at me to pick up i didnt want to be that person anymore so i figured id kill myself and it would stop but my dad  you talked about how powerful he is he somehow cancelled all my personal credit cards i still dont know how he did it laughter and i wasnt able to get on a plane to get home to get what i needed to end my life and so i got on my knees and prayed and that was really the beginningthe president so he did you a great service when he did thatmr solomon he didthe president smart guy you have done an amazing job its so great not easy not easy right ajmr solomon no not easythe president but were very proud of you applausechris  governor christie mr president pam works in the new jersey state department of education and shes someone who came to the candlelight vigil that i held right before christmas for addicts in new jersey and their families and pam wants to tell you the story about her son carlosms garozzo yes first of all mr president mr vice president cabinet and guests this is an extreme honor i am here unfortunately because my son is no longer hereas governor christie said i came to his candlelight vigil celebrating the fact  with our education commissioner who is my boss  that my son was  months clean he had been a year and a half clean before that before he had a relapse  one of many one of several just celebrating his life and celebrating the lives of everybody who are in recoveryand then later in december  actually before that i just want to introduce you this is my son carlos hes wearing a suit because on december rd  this is not his  was not his normal attire as a yearold on december rd he was here at my church with my husband mike and me  mike who is seated behind me and to the left  walking me down the aisle on my wedding day one of the happiest days of my life carlos was healthy happy thriving working getting ready to go back to school had a job had a steady girlfriend had everything together   and a half months cleanso celebrating him at the candlelight vigil previously having been at our wedding on december rd and then three weeks later on december rd two police detectives show up at our door and tell me the news that no parent ever wants to hear and we just didnt understand because this is a disease you dont understand the dynamics of it you cant  youre not  nothing prepares you for this journeyunfortunately my son odd after having been clean for  and a half months  odd on a drug that was laced with fentanyl so he died pretty quickly the president which is getting worse and worse i hear jeff ms garozzo yesthe president getting just out of control ms garozzo so carlos started smoking marijuana when he was  and a half years old and for him  and hed be the first to tell you this  its absolutely for him a gateway drug it led to heroin cocaine crystal meth at  when he was a senior in high school with months to graduate he had a crystal meth overdose and by the time i got to the hospital  because his friend drove him there i didnt even know that he was doing this to this extent  by the time i got to the hospital the er doctor came out and said you need to call your family now we dont think theres anything we can do for your sonwe managed to transfer him to another hospital he got the care that he needed he was in a coma for three days and suffered some minor memory loss from that and of course at this time as an yearold said oh im never going to touch anything again im going to stay clean we had him in a program but less than a couple months later hes back on the streets not only taking drugs but got caught smoking pot ended up in jail i had told him early on i will put every penny every dime i have into your recovery and getting you clean and helping you stay clean and supporting you  percent but if you end up in trouble with the law there is nothing im doing for you because you have to figure out the way out of thatso he was in jail a couple of times he actually went through cold turkey in jail getting clean when he was clean for a period of almost a year and a half during that time he was going back to school he was at this point around  years old     was working volunteering at a recovery house working with people trying to help them work through their program he spoke regionally at a conference in west virginia they selected him because hes a young kid and they figured he would be a good spokesperson maybe be able to speak to peoples heartssadly as i said he did pass nothing in parenting prepares you to deal with the fact that mike and i will outlive our son that his sisters who he idolized and who were so close to him wont see him anymore that there will be empty seats at the thanksgiving table that christmas presents  we wont be able to give ill miss his laughter ill miss his smile ill miss him his hug ill miss his dry witty sense of humor when i asked him if he was walking down the aisle for my wedding to mike he asked me what does that entail sure i think i can do it but what does that mean and i said  i explained to him and he said oh but im pretty sure  ive watched enough tv to know that i have to take mike on a fishing trip and see if he measures up laughter he was constantly  hes just that kind of guy he was just  i had people coming up to us at the life celebration saying your son is amazing you dont know your son saved me your son was one of the people who came and dragged me out of philly the tenement house that i was living in a flophouse and took him in his place and gave him money that he really didnt have just to  brought me to meetings so this is why im here im here because id like to see nationally whats happening  what governor christie has managed to have happen in new jersey with of course the help of the legislators there to make the programs for recovery accessible and affordable to all because this is  i was fortunate to have a good insurance plan but there did come a point where carlos needed to be in a program that wasnt entirely covered by insurance and they wanted to exit him in four days now four days in a recovery program  for those of you who have had no experience  you guys know  thats nothing carlos begged to stay in so we scrambled got the money and were able to keep him inim here so that parents  no parent should have to bury their child no parent should have to wander  as vanessa said i did the drives looking for carlos all hours of the day and night nobody should have to go through this this is entirely something that can be dealt with and i appreciate what you are willing to do in shedding a light on thisthe president if carlos stayed longer in the program would he have been in better shape would it have possibly saved him or not reallyms garozzo well i think so he was in a couple of programs for a period of  one program that was  participant coughsthe president do you want some water are you okayms garozzo im goodthe president no im just saying  behind you i thought she ms garozzo oh im sorry laughter he was in a program for  days that was his most successful program as aj mentioned carlos had an underlying problem with selfesteem and feeling good about himself he just never could quite get there  even though he was an accomplished musician he had a scholarship to a prestigious university as a freshman going in he was accepted into an engineering program that normally that didnt happen he had a lot of gifts and talents but he just never saw them he was always looking for how can i escape and like aj he also thought several times about suicide so i think its treating the whole person its not just the disease of addiction but its what is causing you to go after the drugs to seek it out to stay with it and once youre hooked youre hooked but how can you work within yourself with help to feel good about yourself to feel that youre worthy everybody is loved everybody should feel loved as governor christie said every life is a precious life and i believe governor you also said that every life is worthy of being reclaimed and unfortunately carlos couldnt entirely reclaim his life and behind everybody who is trying  whos suffering with addiction or in recovery theres parents and theres family just like me the president thank you pam carlos sounds like he was a great guy and i know how tough it is so many people go through it and we appreciate you being herems garozzo thank you sirthe president jeff do you have anything to sayattorney general sessions well i just want to thank you for sharing your stories because thats what were all here about and were seeing a surge in drug abuse and addiction the new england journal of medicine had  i think our dea commissioned it  pointed out that with regard to heroin weve got more availability lower price and much higher purity that creates more addiction quicker i think and its a very dangerous situation you throw fentanyl into that too and i do believe mr president we took  when i became a united states attorney in  and the president and others led the education department led  and it took  years but we reduced drug abuse in america addiction and death dramatically its begun now to start back up and i think if we apply the president when did this start again its so bad when did it start would you say  over the last how many years  where it really took the big spike upattorney general sessions i think the fentanyl brought the  if you noticed here  chuck maybe  the dea director chuck rosenberg  the president you would know that when do you think it really started spiking up chuckmr rosenberg mr president there have been spikes in the past weve seen spikes in   and  id say in the last eight to ten years though the trajectory has been awful and theres a number of pieces to it one is that we consume as americans most of the worlds supply of hydrocodone and oxycodone and as these good folks have attested to once you get hooked on that heroin is cheaper and more plentiful and folks just make that transitionwe have to change the culture i think we can one of the things we do at dea  and im extraordinarily proud of our men and women  we do law enforcement really well but ever since i was a brand new federal prosecutor many many years ago i never thought we would enforce or prosecute our way out of this thats part of it its a really important part of itbut weve also at the dea now turned to education prevention we talked about those things all the time i want folks to know if i may sir we do a national takeback program twice a year the next one is on april th and people can drop off at  sites around the country  courtesy of dea and our local partners  anything in their medicine cabinet that they dont want last year we took in  million pounds of stuff it includes everythingthe president thats greatmr rosenberg but were going to do that relentlessly twice a year encourage people to turn in these drugs and try and break this cyclethe president so its been really  it spiked over the last eight to ten years would that have anything to do with the weakening of the borders because a lot of it comes from the southern bordermr rosenberg a lot of it comes through mexico a lot of it is in produced in mexico i should say this weve worked closely with our mexican counterparts there are a lot of brave men and women down there trying to help us do what we do secretary kelly knows that as well as anyonea lot of it also comes from asia i was recently in china i met with our counterparts there a lot of the synthetics fentanyl and carfentanyl which is even worse than fentanyl is produced in china our chinese counterparts have added some of those drugs to their banned list precluding it from  or hopefully precluding it from leaving china and coming to north america so theres a lot of work to be done you got a lot of smart people around this table but i can tell you from the perspective of the dea sir law enforcement is crucial education and prevention and treatment is equally crucialthe president thank you very much chuckall right thank you very much folksq  will you talk about this on the road are you going to take this on the road president trumpthe president yes we will its a big issue  very very big issue thank you thank youend pm edt

2017-03-28,Daily Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer -- #30 ,james s brady press briefing room pm edtmr spicer i know the pool is gathering at  pm so im going to try and keep this on the short endthis morning the president held a listening session with the attorney general and the fraternal order of police with the vice president to discuss law enforcement issues related to terrorism and innercity violencethe fraternal order of police is the worlds largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers with more than  members they represent those who dedicate their lives to protecting and serving they advocate for improved working conditions for law enforcement officers and for the safety of our communitiesthe president thanked the fop leadership for their support and reaffirmed his pledge to have our back the president also remarked that his highest duty is the security of our people and pointed to several actions that hes already taken to enhance our domestic security including the creation of a task force on reducing violent crime an interagency task force to dismantle criminal cartels and historic action to secure our borders and remove criminals from our countrythe group held an indepth discussion about the rise of violent crime in some parts of the country the disturbing increase in members of law enforcement being targeted in ambush style attacks and the need to address the countrys opioid epidemicattorney general sessions told the fop leadership that he looks forward to continuing to work closely with them to tackle the challenges facing law enforcement as they work to keep our communities safethis afternoon as i mentioned at the top the president will sign an executive order on energy independence at the environmental protection agency headquarters the president strongly believes that protecting the environment and promoting our economy are not mutually exclusive goals this executive order will help to ensure that we have clean air and clean water without sacrificing economic growth and job creationfirst it directs all agencies to conduct a review of all regulation rules policies and guidance documents that put up roadblocks to domestic energy production and identify the ones that are not either mandated by law or actually contributing to the public goodit also rescinds a number of the previous administrations actions that dont reflect this administrations priorities the full list is laid out in the executive order which will be provided to you later today after the president signs itnext the order directs the epa to take several actions to reflect this presidents environmental and economic goals including a review of the new performance standards for coalfired and naturalgasfired power plants that amounted to a de facto ban on new coal plant production in the united statesthis is great news for states like wyoming west virginia kentucky pennsylvania and othersfinally the order establishes a directive for agencies to use the best available science and economics in their regulatory analysis moving forwardfor too long the federal government has acted like a barrier to energy independence and innovation by reducing unnecessary regulatory obstacles well free up american energy companies to responsibly use our vast energy resources protecting the environment while creating wellpaying jobs throughout the countryamerican electricity producers have already done an amazing job of adapting and utilizing new technologies to deliver clean power to the united states under president trump the federal government is going to acknowledge that progress and adjust its policies accordinglymoving on later in the afternoon the president will meet with secretary of state tillerson and secretary of homeland security kelly and this evening the president and the first lady will host a reception here in the white house for senators and their spouses this will be the first time that president trump has invited all current senators to the white house and he looks forward to this opportunity as well as to speak with some of the senators about the places where they can come together and make this country betterone of those places that he hopes to find common ground with senate democrats here tonight is the confirmation of judge neil gorsuch to the supreme court yesterday many senate democrats began declaring support for senate minority leader chuck schumers partisan filibuster of judge neil gorsuch and as ive said these senators should get  if these senators get their way this would be the first successful filibuster of a nominee to join the supreme courtleading democrats have lamented these tactics as recently as last year senator schumer in fact wrote last year in an oped in the new york daily news  and i quote  at a time when americans want to move forward the last thing we need  the last thing is a new recipe for gridlock at the supreme courtdemocrat nominee hillary clinton said of the supreme court confirmation progress  it should not be an exercise in political brinkmanship and partisan posturing and that nominees deserve a full and fair hearing followed by a votesenator claire mccaskill of missouri tweeted the constitution says the senate shall advise and consent and that means having an upordown voteso who are senate democrats going to enact this on in extraordinary lengths to block its an individual frankly who their body including senator schumer unanimously confirmed for a seat on the th circuit not too long ago this is a judge who received a unanimous well qualified rating by the american bar association was a harvard law graduate who received the edward j randolph award for outstanding service at the department of justice so it cant be their qualifications theyre taking issue withjudge gorsuch is frankly a mainstream judge here are some figures and facts to point that out number one in  percent of the cases in which he issued the opinion he received the unanimous support of all of his colleagues second in divided cases over the last five years involving both republican and democratappointed judges judge gorsuch sided with the democratappointed judge one in three timeswhen the shoe was on the other foot when a supreme court nominee for a democratic president went through the confirmation hearings and meetings with senators from both parties neither justices kagan nor sotomayor faced an attempted senate filibuster both received republican votes in support of their confirmationsin fact during the kagan nomination on the senate floor when senate leader harry reid planned to file a cloture motion to bring kagan to a vote it was thensenator and now current attorney general jeff sessions who stopped him and said i have a high standard before i would attempt to block an up or down vote and asked senator reid to proceed with a vote without the need for overcoming a republican filibusterjudge gorsuch has met with most of the senate democratic caucus he has gone through days of hearings and answered probing questions he is eminently qualified and deserves the deference and consideration from the minority senate democrats that president obamas selections were given once they had gone through the confirmation processa few things i want to highlight last night the president announced his intent to nominate makan delrahim to serve as assistant attorney general of the antitrust divisio at the department of justice and this morning we announced the presidents declaration that a major disaster exists in the state of nevada and ordered federal assistance to supplement recovery effort in the areas affected by severe storms flooding and mudslides this past februaryand finally this morning the president was pleased to see that ford announced  billion investment in three manufacturing facilities in michigan just two weeks after automobile executives came to the white house and met with the president this adds to the growing wave of positive news  jobs news under the president and continued the investment from charter communications and his approval for the keystone xl pipeline on fridayin addition energy transfer partners reported monday that the dakota access pipeline has been filled with oil as they enter the final stages of preparation that will finally put this into service according to data released by the conference board in march consumer confidence soared to its highest level in  years and from individual announcements to significant boosts in both consumer and ceo confidence generally its clear that the presidents economic agenda is what americas businesses have been waiting for these businesses have spent years being held back by unnecessary bureaucratic red tape and what were seeing now is just the taste of the heights our economy can reach once those burdens are removedand lastly i want to make a comment on a false report regarding former acting attorney general sally yates as a matter of fact id like to walk you through the sequence of events just to make sure that everyone is abundantly clear on what happened on march th chairman nunes and ranking member schiff invited sally yates to testify on march th on march rd sally yatess attorney sent a letter to the department of justice asking for their consent to testify without constraints on march th the department of justice responded the president owns those privileges to discuss the communications they were requesting to talk about and referred them to the white housealso on the th ms yatess attorney sent a letter to the white house counsel requesting that consent specifically stating that if they did not receive a response by march th at  am they would conclude that the white house does not assert executive privilege over these matters the white house did not respond and took no action that prevented ms yates from testifying thats the story thats what the documents showand with that im glad to take some questionsq  can i follow on that seanmr spicer of course you can john robertsq  id like to follow on that there are reports that even though the hearing that was set for the th was not scheduled it was cancelled by devin nunes to prevent this white house from publicly invoking a claim of executive privilege could you speak to thatmr spicer i hope she testifies i look forward to itit was never  lets be honest the hearing was never  we actually never notified if they choose to move forward great we have no problem with her testifying plain and simple the report in the washington post is  percent false the letters that they frankly publish on their website all back up everything i just read all of the letters are available on their website  i hate to give them the traffic  but the reality is is that they specifically say if you dont respond were going to go ahead we didnt respond we encouraged them to go aheadbut to suggest in any way shape or form that we stood in the way of that is  percent falsebrianq  a couple of things you said earlier a couple of quick followups you said you want the agencies to use best available science does that meant theres going to be no further scientific research you dont want to fund additional scientific research and number two what other issues do you like to see the president reach out to democratsmr spicer so on the first one best science is best science and thats whatever q  best available is what you saidmr spicer right well if its not available its tough to use it just as a matter of practicality q  well but is that a code for not using mr spicer no its a code for its got to be available thats it plain and simple you shouldnt read anything into that and i think the president will speak more to that at todays signing at  pm  at  pm rather im sorry q  and are democrats mr spicer i think theres a whole host of issues i talked yesterday about healthcare if they want to come together on infrastructure tax reform wed love to have as much support as possibleeamonq  thanks sean a couple questions one on coal your actions today the white house is saying that theyre going to reverse president obamas socalled war on coal but a lot of people in the coal industry suggest that jobs are just not going to come back in that industry based on the way the industry has changed technology and other things does this administration have an estimate of how many jobs will be created as a result of the actions its taking todaymr spicer im not aware of one an estimate i know that the president has already met with some of the coal miners the other day and senators manchin and capito in particular from west virginia and others from kentucky that were here when we did that eo signing a few days ago i will tell you that from a mining perspective the miners and the owners are very very bullish on this so the people who are actually in the business applaud this effort believe that it will do a lot to revive the industry its obviously a private industry so im not going to get into who does what but i know that the industry itself said sosteveq  on the court announcement you just said that the announcement today comes two weeks after the automakers met here at the white house did the white house or the president do anything in that meeting that led to this announcement todaymr spicer i think theres been some regulatory effort and some commitments on the regulatory efforts going forward in the future that i think may have played a role i would ask ford on that i think its a continued sign of it i think we have seen a number of industry leaders union leaders truckers truck companies come in talk about burdens and i think theres been several cases where meetings in the white house  or frankly we went to michigan and held that roundtable out there as well  that meetings that we have have a very positive followup in terms of a commitment from a company or an industry to create jobs to invest more in this country but in each of these cases q  is the white house then going to get political credit for this announcement todaymr spicer ill leave it up to ford to make that determination i think that were obviously pleased with more americans getting jobs throughout various sectors and i think that well continue and the president has made it very clear that he continues to fight to bring back jobs and manufacturing here in the countrysteveq  sean as you begin looking seriously at tax reform could you just go through what is the presidents bottom line does it need to have middleclass tax relief corporate tax relief can you do it comprehensively or piecemeal do you add infrastructure spending to it somehow how are you looking at thismr spicer so on the first two those are both key components  the middleclass individual tax piece of it and then the corporate rate has to come down i think those are guiding principles that the president has laid out as far as how the process works there are  and i dont want to get ahead of the folks in the legislative affairs or the guys on capitol hill but i would suggest to you that theres a prevailing attitude out there that the fy reconciliation is probably the most likely vehicle to move some of thisagain what we want to do is keep a lot of options on the table in terms of do we put infrastructure in is there another vehicle to drive that but part of gathering folks together now from capitol hill from industry from groups is to begin that discussion to talk about what needs to go in what the way forward is and so that conversation has begun and is continuing q  and when do you think youll have some recommendations to take to the president mr spicer well internally the team has been talking to him for a while i think theres a bigger discussion that has to happen as we branch out with outside groups industry members of capitol hill et cetera that start to formulate some additional listening that needs to happen on this and again i think part of it is theres a legislative strategy that needs to tie into thisblakeq  is the white house currently involved in any renegotiations of the healthcare bill and if so in what mannermr spicer staff has met with individuals and listened to them so i dont know how detailed you want it have we had some discussions and listened to ideas yes are we actively planning an immediate strategy not at this time i think there is a discussion that began as i mentioned yesterday of a lot of individuals on both sides of the aisle reaching out to both the president and key staff members to share ideas and additional ways forward so there has been a discussion and i believe there will be several moreq  what would you say to the folks who have a genuine concern that if you could not get healthcare done how do you go about getting bigticket items like tax reform and infrastructure done people say if you cant get one how are you going to do the next what would you say to that concernmr spicer well again i think  i mean were going to build a coalition for this i think each of them have different constituencies and i think were going to work with members on both sides of the aisle on both of those bigticket issues to see where we can find agreement and move forward but i dont want to prejudge the outcome at this pointjohnq  thank you sean just as a followup question on blakes did the president himself have any discussions with speaker ryan or leader mccarthy or anyone over the weekend about healthcare and making an actual vote on the american health care act and one got the impression from speaker ryan today that he was going to try to pass this with republican votes which would contradict some of your statements about reaching out to democrats all along has any of this come up with discussions between each side of pennsylvania avenuemr spicer so i think i talked yesterday  they have spoken a few times about different strategies different ideas different policy aspects to the bill q  over the weekendthe president absolutely at least on a number of  at least two maybe three times theyve spoken and i know several of our staff members have also engaged in discussions again to talk about potential ways forward so those conversations have occurred i think thats what i mentioned to blake and i mentioned some of it yesterday and if we can find a way forward well do it but look i dont think  just so were clear john to your question im not saying weve picked a strategy and were going to go with this group or that group i think the president was  several people reached out and expressed an interest and the presidents view is that hes willing to listen to them and hear what their ideas areand i made a comment yesterday that was  that just so were clear we have  lets call it   somewhere in there votes right maybe  depending on what it is the point that i made yesterday is to get to  to get to  depending on the day of the week there are certain things that people want that would take what i think the president views as a very good bill that werent worth doing it because they would make the deal bad and so the question is can we add the additional votes in ways that enhance the bill or bring people over that have been previous skeptics but theres a way in which people are saying hey if you bring me on board with these five provisions then im on board  in which either a take people off the bill or dont make it as strong and make it a bad deal and i think thats the balancing act that has to happen one is can you add additional folks on without pushing additional folks off and two is that what you have to add to the bill does it make it stronger or does it not because i think there are suggestions by some out there that have said were willing to come along with the bill but in doing so it would make it a bad deal and thats an important aspect is how do you take whatever that number is that we have now and get it up to  to pass without making  without losing people andor making it a bad dealq  sean does it mr spicer hold on glenn ive already q   done with republican votes not democratsmr spicer however we get there johnfrancescaq  thank you sean yesterday you werent able to tell us very much about congressman nuness visit to the white house or to the white house grounds to view classified information last week a democrat on the committee today said that the white house would have known that he was here the same democrat also said that it looked like a criminal coverup to him my question to you is have you learned any more information since we had this conversation yesterday about how he would have even gotten in and how he would have gotten cleared and do you think that congressman nunes should recuse himself from being in charge of the russian investigation at this pointmr spicer well number one on the latter part of that its not up to me hes a member of the house hes appointed by the speaker that is entirely up to the speaker and the members of the house of representatives were not going to start commenting on that kind of stuffi do think that he is running an investigation which we asked for and i think the thing thats important to note is there is somewhat of a double standard when it comes to classified information when leaks are made illegally to the press and you all report them the coverage focuses almost entirely on the substance of the allegation and that are part of an illegal lead not on the illegal nature of the disclosure the identity of the leaks or their agendabut when the information that is occurring now which is two individuals who were properly cleared  or three or whoever he met with  i dont know  that they are sharing stuff that is entirely legal with the appropriate clearances  and then there is an obsession on the processand its sort of  its a backwards way that when you all report on stuff with sources that are leaking  illegally leaking classified information thats appropriate and fine no one questions that  the substance and material when two individuals or however many are engaged in this process have a discussion that is  percent legal and appropriate and cleared suddenly the obsession becomes about the process and not the substanceand i think that it is somewhat reckless and  how the conversation over classified information is discussed without  while sort of attempting to press a false narrative that exists so while it is completely appropriate to share classified information with individuals who are cleared it is clearly not the case to do that when it is illegally leaked out and i think thats sort of the irony of how this whole conversation has gonejohnq  thanks a lot sean just following up on your statement in regards to the washington post story that you say is false did the white house counsel office ever consider invoking privilege as it relates to sally yates testifying before this congressional committeemr spicer noq  and why is that you certainly would be in a position to invoke privilege after all these were privileged communications between the acting attorney general and the executive office of the president that would fall into privilegemr spicer because i know this will be a shocker but again part of it is that i think that weve been very clear that when you actually get to the bottom of the facts every single person who has been briefed on this as ive said ad nauseam from this podium that they have been very clear that there is no connection between the president or the staff here and anyone doing anything with russia and i think that the view here was great go share what you know so no and thats why the washington post should be ashamed of how it handled this story it was  percent false the letters that they actually publish back up exactly what were saying that she was asked about this information  her attorney asked the doj the doj said that she had to ask the white house they made it very clear if you dont do this we are going to go forward we had no objection to her going forward thats itq  just quickly following up on that i have two questions on two different topics so were taking what youre saying as assurances that chairman nuness decision to call of that hearing did not have anything to do with any pressure from with white housemr spicer noq  okay thank you on a different topic were seeing more states  maine virginia and kansas specifically  moving to expand medicaid under the affordable care act joining the plus states that have already done that what is president trumps message to republican legislators and legislators generally in those states now that the affordable care acts future is so uncertainmr spicer i think theres a reason he explained to congress and especially members who have talked about entitlement expansion why we should have passed this bill last week and why we need to address it now this is a major issue it was one of our talking points so i hope they listenq  does he encourage the expansionmr spicer i think he understands that the way that it was handled in terms of the ablebodied provision under that right now are leading to an implosion on that piece of the entitlement and that there was an opportunity to refocus it and to push the money and a lot of the authority back to the states to best determine how to handle issues within their states  both in terms of highrisk pools and individuals that they wanted to cover so we  frankly the bill made it a much more states rights program and a much more states rights decisionmaking process in terms of how to care for the populations that they had to addressceciliaq  thank you just a couple things on the yates thing so how and when exactly did the white house encourage her to testifymr spicer well the letter that her attorney sent literally says that if we do not receive a response by march th at  am i will conclude that the white house does not assert executive privilege over the matters with respect to hearings or otherwise i dont think you can be any clearer than thatq  and so youre saying now executive privilege does not mr spicer no no im not saying anything im literally  thats what she wrote the action was if you dont act then we will assume the following great i dont think that you can read that any other way it was very  shes a im sure a very talented  he is a very talented lawyer and wrote it specifically for it we read it that way and chose to not act because we have no problem with her testifying  plain and simpleq  so executive privilege is not an issue for sally yates  would not have been an issue for sally yates testifyingmr spicer thats correctq  okay thank you and following one issue  do you want to addmr spicer no i just  its interesting i mean this is very clearly worded and yet somehow youre asking me how to interpret that in any other way than literally reading plain englishq  okay interpret something else for me does the president still believe that climate change is a hoaxmr spicer i think you will hear more today about the climate and what he believes i think he understands  he does not believe that  as i mentioned at the outset that there is a binary choice between job creation economic growth and caring about the environment and thats what we should be focusing on i think at the end of the day where we should be focusing on is making sure that all americans have clean water clean air and that we do what we can to preserve and protect our environmentapril go aheadq  all right thank you sean  dont seem so happy anyway with all of these investigations questions of what is is how does this administration try to revamp its image two and a half months in youve got this yates story today youve got other things going on youve got russia youve got wiretapping youve got mr spicer no we dont have thatq  there are investigations on capitol hill mr spicer no no  i get it but you keep  ive said it from the day that i got here until whatever that there is no connection youve got russia if the president puts russian salad dressing on his salad tonight somehow thats a russian connection but every single person q  its beyond that youre making itmr spicer well no  i appreciate your agenda here but the reality is q  its not my agendamr spicer no hold on at some point report the facts the facts are that every single person who has been briefed on this subject has come away with the same conclusion  republican democrat so im sorry that that disgusts you youre shaking your head i appreciate it but q  im shaking my head and im listening and im trying to get mr spicer okay but understand this  that at some point the facts are what they are and every single person who has been briefed on this situation with respect to the situation with russia  republican democrat obamaappointee career  have all come to the same conclusion at some point april youre going to have to take no for an answer with respect to whether or not there was collusionq  but my question was how do you change the perception of mr spicer were going to keep doing everything were doing to make sure that the president  that what the president told the american people he was going to do to fulfill those pledges and promises that he made to bring back jobs to grow the economy to keep our nation safe  thats what hes been focused on since day one were going to keep focusing on that every single dayq  but when condi rice comes friday condi rice did not support this president she did not go to the convention she comes  what is on the agenda and how is their relationship has it healed since  when he used a very negative word to describe hermr spicer so heres what ill  hey its interesting that you ask those two questions backtoback on the one hand youre saying what are we doing to improve our image and then here he is once again meeting somebody that hasnt been a big supporter of hisq  but he called her that negative name in mr spicer no no but you put it  april hold on it seems like youre hellbent on trying to make sure that whatever image you want to tell about this white house stays because at the end of the day  q  i am just reporting what mr spicer okay but you know what youre asking me a question and im going to answer it which is the president  im sorry please stop shaking your head again but at some point the reality is that this president continues to reach out to individuals whove supported him who didnt support him  republicans democrats  to try to bring the country together and move forward on an agenda thats going to help every americanthats it plain and simple so if youre asking what were doing i think we continue to do it which is to bring groups together that have been supportive of him that havent been supportive of him but that to share a goal which is finding common ground on areas of national security of personal security of economic security of job creation of safer communities of education of healthcare that can unite us as a country and make the country strongerq   about russia and tillerson fridaymr spicer i think theyre going to  im not ready to when were done with that well see if we can have a readoutq  inaudiblemr spicer hold on i understand that were not at friday yet i will have a readout when thats done i know the pool needs to get to the vans for the signing thank you ill be back tomorrow were going to do five days in a row this week ladies and

2017-03-27,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 3/27/2017, #29 ",james s brady briefing room pm edtmr spicer hi guys good afternoon i hope everyone had a great weekend seriously its monday so i brought a special guestfirst id like to have the attorney general come up to the podium to make an announcement regarding immigration enforcement with respect to sanctuary cities when the attorney general is done speaking well have time for a couple questions and then ill continue with the briefing so if your question is not germane to sanctuary cities keep your hand down and well get to it after we go through the events of the dayso with that attorney general sessions come on upattorney general sessions thank you sean the department of justice has a view to enforce our nations laws including our immigration laws those laws require us to promptly remove aliens when they are convicted or detained of certain crimes the vast majority of american people support this commonsense requirement according to one recent poll  percent of americans believe that cities that arrest illegal immigrants for crimes should be required to turn them over to immigration authorities unfortunately some states and cities have adopted policies designed to frustrate this enforcement of immigration laws this includes refusing to detain known felons on the federal detainer request or otherwise failing to comply with these lawsfor example the department of homeland security recently issued a report showing that in a single week there were more than  instances of jurisdictions refusing to honor ice detainer requests with respect to individuals charged or convicted of a serious crime the charges and convictions against these aliens included drugtrafficking hitandrun rape sex offenses against a child and even murder such policies cannot continue they make our nation less safe by putting dangerous criminals back on the streets we all remember the tragic case of kate steinle the yearold woman who was shot and killed two years ago in san francisco as she walked along a pier with her father the shooter francisco sanchez was an illegal immigrant who had already been deported five times and had seven felony convictionsjust  weeks before the shooting san francisco had released sanchez from its custody even though immigration and customs enforcement officers had filed a detainer requesting that he be held in custody until immigration authorities could pick him up for removal even worse sanchez admitted the only reason he came to san francisco was because it was a sanctuary city a similar story unfolded just last week when ever valles an illegal immigrant and a mexican national was charged with murder and robbery of a man at a light rail station valles was released from a denver jail in late december despite the fact that ice has lodged a detainer for his removal the american people are not happy with these results they know that when cities and states refuse to help enforce immigration laws our nation is less safe failure to deport aliens who are convicted of criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk especially immigrant communities in the very sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect the perpetratorsduis assaults burglaries drug crimes gang rapes crimes against children and murderers  countless americans would be alive today and countless loved ones would not be grieving today if these policies of sanctuary cities were ended not only do these policies endanger lives of every american  just last may the department of justice inspector general found that these policies also violate federal law the president has rightly said disregard for the law must end in his executive order he stated that it is the policy of the executive branch to ensure that states and cities comply with all federal laws including all immigration lawstoday im urging states and local jurisdictions to comply with these federal laws including  usc section  moreover the department of justice will require that jurisdictions seeking or applying for department of justice grants to certify compliance with  as a condition of receiving those awardsthis policy is entirely consistent with the department of justices office of justice programs guidance that was issued just last summer under the previous administration this guidance requires state and local jurisdictions to comply and certify compliance with section  in order to be eligible for ojp grants it also made clear that failure to remedy violations could result in withholding grants termination of grants and disbarment or ineligibility for future grants the department of justice will also take all lawful steps to claw back any funds awarded to a jurisdiction that willfully violates  in the current fiscal year the department of justices office of justice program and community oriented policing services anticipates awarding more than  billion in grants i strongly urge our nations states and cities and counties to consider carefully the harm they are doing to their citizens by refusing to enforce our immigration laws and to rethink these policies such policies make their cities and states less safe  public safety as well as national security are at stake  and put them at risk of losing federal dollarsthe american people want and deserve a lawful system of immigration that keeps us safe and one that serves the national interest this expectation is reasonable just and our government has the duty to meet it and we will meet itthank youq  in montgomery county right up the road there was a rape in maryland at rockville high school has anyone from the department of justice had any conversations with anyone in montgomery county or rockville as they describe themselves as a sanctuary county and city and theres also a boatload of federal government in montgomery countyattorney general sessions well you know maryland is talking about a state law to make the state a sanctuary state the governor is opposed to that im glad to hear that would be such a mistake i would plead with the people of maryland to understand that this makes the state of maryland more at risk for violence and crime it is not good policy and as a former prosecutor for many years in state and federal law in jurisdictions i just know the historic relationship different federal agencies have with regard to honoring detainers its just a fundamental principle of law enforcement that if you have a person arrested and another jurisdiction has a charge then they file a detainer and when you finish with the prisoner you turn them over to the next jurisdiction for their adjudication that is why it should be done mr spicer majorq  mr attorney general so listening to you carefully it sounds like youre applying the standards and the policy that the obama administration put forward on compliance with underlying justice department rules are you taking any additional steps and have you asked the president to maybe talk about other federal funds that are not necessarily under your control as a way to punish sanctuary cities or statesattorney general sessions well thats a good question what im saying today is that essentially the policies of the obama administration that were issued last july make clear that you should not be receiving certain federal funds if youre not in compliance with  we believe that grants in the future could be issued that have additional requirements as every grant thats being issued in america today usually has a requirement that if you qualify for this grant you have to meet certain requirements so well be looking at that in the future and well continue to pursue it but fundamentally we intend to use all the lawful authority we have to make sure that our state and local officials who are so important to law enforcement are in sync with the federal governmentq  some officials in cities for example  bigger cities  have said despite the lack of federal funding they will continue to be sanctuary cities that they dont care that theyre losing money essentially what recourse does the department of justice have in those cities that look at what youre doing and say we dont care were going to continue to implement this policyattorney general sessions well thats very disheartening but i hope that the american people and their constituents in their own cities will communicate with them and as we continue a dialogue and a discussion and as we continue to ensure that monies that go for law enforcement only go to cities who are participating in an effective collegial cooperative way with the federal government that that would also send a message we have simply got to end this policy thank you all mr spicer okay you guys ready to continueq  yesmr spicer good before i get into todays schedule i wanted to read  i know theres been some interest in the state departments statement regarding the arrest of hundreds of protestors  peaceful protestors  that occurred in russia the statement that the state department put out saysthe united states strongly condemns the detention of hundreds of peaceful protestors throughout russia on sunday the detention of peaceful protestors human rights observers and journalists is an affront to essential democratic values we are troubled to hear of the arrest of the opposition leader upon arrival at the demonstration as well as the police raids on the anticorruption organization he heads the united states will monitor the situation and we call on the government of russia to immediately release all peaceful protestors the russian people like people everywhere deserve a government that supports an open marketplace of ideas transparent and accountable governance equal treatment under the law and the ability to exercise their rights without fear of retributionnow with respect to events for the day this morning after receiving his daily intelligence briefing the president participated in a roundtable with women small business owners the president is hosting a group of women business owners as part of the white houses full calendar of womens history month events at the roundtable this morning vice president pence sba administrator mcmahon joined with other senior administration officials to hear from these amazing female entrepreneurs and small business leaders about their firsthand experiences successes and challenges as the president said empowering and promoting women in business is an absolute priority in the trump administration because i know how crucial women are as jobcreators role models and leaders all throughout our communities the women in attendance this morning have incredible stories including many who have started businesses from scratch with very limited resources and through hard work and determination turned their dreams into reality between them they provide hundreds of jobs to americans across the country the president is dedicated to continuing to remove the unique barriers that women face in our economy including access to capital markets and networks this administration will continue to advocate for policies that support working family including a national initiative to promote women business leaders and entrepreneurs that his daughter ivanka is helping to leadin honor of womens history month the white house has been hosting events all throughout march just to name a few the centers for medicaid and medicare systems administrator verma held a roundtable with women in healthcare which the president attended the first lady held a womens empowerment lunch on international womens day earlier this month second lady karen pence joined women from all five military branches for lunch at fort meade and last week hosted military women at the vice presidents residence to thank them for their service under president trump the american economy is a place for everyone regardless of their gender to thrive following the roundtable the president had lunch with the vice president and secretary of state tillerson and at three oclock the president will sign house joint resolutions    and   all of which use the powers of the congressional review act to roll back jobkilling rules before this administration only one time in the nations history had a president ever signed a bill that used the congressional review act to cancel a federal regulation in just his first  days as president he will have signed six resolutions to eliminate unnecessary and burdensome ruleshouse joint resolution  rolls back the socalled blacklisting rule which manufacturers identified during their meeting with the president as one of the most significant threats to growing american businesses and hiring more american workers the rule simply made it too easy for trial lawyers to go after american companies and american workers who contract with the federal government the president saw that workers taxpayers and businesses were the ones who truly suffered under this rule and he is glad to be signing legislation to eliminate ithouse joint resolution    and  cancel federal power grabs that took decisionmaking away from the states and local governments who know the unique challenges of their own populations the president firmly believes that washington is not always the solution to these problems and that these bills return the power to the people by putting more decisionmaking in the hands of stateshouse joint resolution  removes a bureau of land management rule known as planning  that would have centralized federal and land management in washington diluting the concerns of local citizens who have a right that is protected by law to be involved in this decisionmaking processhj res  and  eliminate the department of education regulations which limits states flexibility in how they assess the performance of schools and teacher preparation and programs removing these additional layers of bureaucracy will make it easier for parents teachers and communities and state leaders to address the needs of their studentsthe president will continue to work with congress and the rest of the federal government until every unnecessary regulation that stands in the way of success for american business and american people is taken off the booksadditionally the president spoke with german chancellor merkel and indian prime minister modi earlier today to congratulate them on their parties success in recent elections well have readouts on those calls a little later for you boththe president also will announce the establishment of the office of american innovation the office of american innovation will apply the presidents ahead of schedule and under budget mentality to a wide number of government operations and service enhancing the quality of life for all americans the office will have a particular focus on technology and data hearing back from leaders in the industryas some of its first priorities the office will focus on modernizing the technology of every federal department identifying transformational infrastructure projects and reimagining the va system so that it can better serve our nations heroes the effort will be led by assistant to the president and senior adviser jared kushnertomorrow the president will sign an executive order to strengthen the nations energy security by reducing unnecessary regulatory obstacles that restrict the responsible use of domestic energy resources this order will help keep energy and electricity affordable reliable and clean in order to boost economic growth and job creationand finally before i came out today senate democrats continued their obstruction to the presidents nomination of judge neil gorsuch to the supreme court with the judiciary committee seeking a oneweek postponement on its decisionover the weekend senate minority leader chuck schumer defended his decision to mount a filibuster against the presidents unquestionably qualified nominee if senator schumer gets his way this would be the first successful filibuster against a supreme court nominee in american history he argued quite misleadingly that the senate has required a vote threshold of every supreme court nominee thats simply not trueand as ive said before only three supreme court justices have faced a filibuster in the last half of the century senator schumer cited four justices confirmed under president bush and obama but in fact among those four only one faced an attempted filibuster  that was justice samuel alito and it was president obama who then as a senator voted to filibuster justice alito and later publicly expressed his regret for thatthe fact is an attempted filibuster of a supreme court nominee is rare and to do so in this context with such an eminently qualified and brilliant judge is nothing short of obstructionism thats why senator pat leahy the former democratic chairman of the senate judiciary said he is not inclined to filibuster even if he ultimately may not vote to confirm the judgethe fact that the former chairman of the judiciary committee wont stand by the minority leader exposes the leaders efforts as nothing but obstructionism that undermines decades of senate tradition through four days of extensive hearings judge gorsuch demonstrated his judicial philosophy his sterling academic credentials and a brilliant legal mind he deserves a fair up or down voteand with that id be glad to take a few of your questions jonathanq  is the president serious about working with democrats going forward after what happened with healthcaremr spicer absolutely in fact starting friday afternoon through late yesterday hes received a number of calls as well as other members of the senior staff that had been working on healthcare from members of both sides saying that they would like to work together offer up ideas and had suggestions about how to come to resolution on this and get to a house vote on this q  but q  but wouldnt this require a mr spicer im sorry john this isnt a freeforall jonathan is asking the question q  but wouldnt this require a serious course correction for the white house i mean the president branded chuck schumer a clown worked entirely with republicans on this bill wouldnt this require a serious change of course for the presidentmr spicer to some degree sure and i think the president talked about that i think we learned a lot through this process i think were obviously looking at ways that we can improve not only how we handle healthcare but other things  how we do everything and i mentioned it to some of you in the course of things i think one of the traits of a successful organization is to always examine how you do things but i think that theres been a lot of outreach from members of both sides with ideas and the president is willing to listen to these individuals and if they can come to a resolution on a way forward obviously were willing to listen and to move forwardbut there are a lot of folks that came forward with these ideas and with all due respect to the beginning of your question i dont think its a oneway street some of the comments that have been made i think some of the democrats who now say they werent involved early on in the process said that they wanted nothing to do with this process there was no way that they would engage in any discussion to repeal so i think its a twoway street and i think that we have been willing to listen to folks and their ideas and the presidents advice is that if we can come up with resolution on a way to move forward well certainly entertain thatq  where does the buck stop for this failure does the buck stop mr spicer just so were clear look were at the beginning of a process i dont think weve seen the end of healthcare as most people have noted i think the obama administration from beginning to end it ultimately took about  months and went through a series of fits and starts and it wasnt until scott brown was elected denying them the th vote in the senate that they finally jammed something through and frankly a lot of the reason that the secretary of health and human services has some of the powers that they do is because they had to jam it through but there were several failures when obamacare went through during the process and ultimately they tried to go through a singlepayer process and they got rebuffed on that by some of their own membersso look were not saying its the end of healthcare but i think that we are looking to look for a way forward and i think that a lot of the members  and again on both sides of the aisle  have reached out not just to the president but to members of the team willing to share some ideas both that will make  that they think would make the bill stronger but ultimately the goal is to get to  and potentially  depending on where we are with special electionsand so were going to look to see where we can get those  votes and there may be other opportunities to work with people across the aisle that get us to  but thats the name of the game and were going to continue to pursue that jimq  sean the last congress passed significant tax reform it took about five years and that was  years ago in  after the failure or defeat of the american health care act on an issue where there was broad gop consensus what makes the president think he can pass significant tax reform this yearmr spicer well i think its been  years i think people  we have a series of  we have an economy thats evolved especially in the technology area they just made a lot of things change and i think our tax code is outdated and frankly on the business side were uncompetitive theres a reason that companies are leaving america to go to other places because the same reason sometimes companies move from state to state our corporate and regulatory system has become unattractive for a lot of companies that want to either manufacture here grow here or begin here or want to return jobs herei think the president recognized that and business leaders from around the country its not a partisan issue i mean you go out to the tech sector out in silicon valley in particular theres a lot of these companies out there that admittedly werent with the president during the election or continued not to be and i think recognized that we are not as competitive as we can be when you consider the tax and regulatory climate of other countries around the world and we need to be more competitiveand then i think you look at the individual side of the house and i think especially when you talk to middleincome americans especially in the context of health premiums skyrocketing up they recognize that they need some relief and so weve got to do what we can to address thatjonchristopherq  thank you historically since healthcare has beguiled many presidents all the way to harry truman and certainly when hillary clinton came to washington she went to the hill and thought that she could get it done im sure there are many lessons you can learn from previous presidents and perhaps previous first ladies has the president thought about reaching out to hillary and finding out how she maneuvered and some of the best practices or some of the pitfalls that she came tomr spicer and i think that you know  i mean hes met with dr zeke emanuel and others  its not been a  hes reached out to several people throughout this process to gauge both their policy ideas and strategy ideas and i think the president noted on friday afternoon that we learned a lot on several fronts about strategically how to handle this as well as some of the members that we thought we would have with us and were reexamining that on a variety of bases margaretq  thank you we got some guidance from the white house earlier about chairman nuness meeting on the white house grounds involving inaudible any idea that questions about the meeting should be referred to the committee chairman but i wanted to ask a slightly different question which is does the white house know now what absolutely happened do you have issues with the idea that someone perhaps in the executive branch shared information from the white house grounds without you knowing about it or are you investigating this do you believe there was a leak or was it in fact someone on the white house staff or nsc staff or on loan to either who provided the information and therefore its not leakedmr spicer so obviously all of what i know has been available through public comments i know that chairman nunes confirmed that he was on white house grounds tuesday and frankly any questions regarding who he met with or why he was here should be referred to him ive seen some of the comments that hes made to your outlet in particular about who he met with and i would refer you to his comments that hes made im not going to get into who he met with or why he met with them i think thats something that he had made very clear and ill let him answer it he is the one who has discussed what he is reviewing and so i will leave it up to him and not try to get in the middle of thatq  can i just follow up just to close the circle on it im asking a slightly different question or at least im trying to ask a slightly different question which is does the white house know what happened now beyond public accounts and are you satisfied that you dont have an inappropriate leak in the executive branchmr spicer no were not concerned about that i know that he is  again everything that i know about what he has done is through public reports that he has made on the record to different folks when he said he has multiple sources he had met with different folks to gather things as part of his review of the situation and so all i know and what im willing to communicate is what has been made available through ontherecord comments that he has madeq  but to come to white house grounds you have to be cleared mr spicer no not necessarily i dont know that members of congress need to be clearedq  wouldnt the white house want to know mr spicer again i think theres a difference hes doing a review and its not something that were going to necessarily get in the middle of or get in the way of part of it is to let him review and have conversations and look at things that he thinks are relevantq  sean a clarification on your answer to margaret you said i dont know that members of congress have to get cleared in there was some question about that who in the white house signed him in essentially to be able to mr spicer i dont know that you have to ill be glad to check on that im not sure that thats how that works but i will follow up on that pointq  okay and my second question is  and its related to this  i understand that youre not going to speak about some of the swirl surrounding this issue with chairman nunes does the white house believe that he can still lead an impartial investigation or would the administration support some of these calls now for an independent committee to investigate thismr spicer first of all i would question what this is because as ive mentioned countless times from this podium theres two issues at hand  theres multiple number one theres any action with respect to russia itself and every single person thats been briefed by director comey in particular and the fbi has said theres nothing there what he is looking into are two things that we are aware of because of the pleas that we have made one is the leaks of classified and other information that have come out and two is whether or not there has been people that have been unmasked and whether or not there was surveillance  i dont know why  we stand by the original request that was made and i think director comey in open testimony the other day talked about what the fbi is looking intoso i think we have a lot of people looking into this whole situationq  will the administration pursue will the white house pursue a leak investigation into whoever is giving chairman nunes this information if its in the executive branchmr spicer at this point were letting his  the review of this situation proceed and we can address that after he decides to be clear about thatq  why is this leak okay but other leaks are notmr spicer i think theres a difference between a leak and someone pursuing a review of a situation that they have determined theres a difference between a leak  someone leaking out to reporters for nefarious  to take classified information and share it with people who arent cleared chairman nunes is cleared hes the chairman of the intelligence committee someone who is cleared to shared classified information with somebody else cleared is not a leakzekeq  i have two for you just a quick housekeeping note at the beginning of the briefing you read out that the state department stated on the protests and arrests in russia does that reflect the white houses viewsmr spicer that reflects the view of the united states governmentq  okay just wanted to clarify that and secondly back on  you mentioned there were lessons learned off of what went down last week the last several weeks around healthcare can you give us some specifics on what some of those lessons are in terms of the president talked a lot about he learned a lot about loyalty i think is one of the lines he stated on friday does he believe that some members of his party are no longer loyal to him will you go through what are some of the lessons that mr spicer no im not going to detail go through  i mean obviously this is an internal thing but i will say that we look at things like  everything from who we met with and when we met with them to whether or not we should have  how everything was rolled out and what organizations were met with what commitments were met and when but theres a lot that goes into this and you look at whether or not thats applicable to another situation whether thats unique but obviously yeah you do look at some of the individuals that you met with both in terms of timing in terms of commitment in terms of substance and evaluate just the process itself but then also to some degree the individuals and whether or not that is someone that q  whos leading that reviewmr spicer theres several folks again it depends on the aspect of it theres a legislative affairs team theres a public policy team theres a comms aspect to this but we all internally talk about what went well what didnt and we do that not just with the bad but the goodi mean i think jonathan asked it somewhere at the beginning but i think most organizations  whether or not you do something really well or not as well  its usually incumbent upon you to think what did we do well so that for things that we did really well we sustain those kinds of aspects of something  because theres always something to improve  and even when you dont do as well but theres part of things that you did that you did well and you dont want to throw the baby out with the bath water so theres an ongoing piece to thismajorq  just a quick followup on chairman nunes and then i have a question about jared in a second so yes members of congress may not need to be cleared in but to get access to a scif i do believe that requires some cooperation from the executive branch because there are intelligence places on capitol hill that are secure that his meeting could have taken place so it creates the impression that chairman nunes came over here and with some degree of cooperation with this white house was able to carry out this meeting and then make the announcement that he did which is perceived by some  most of them democrats ill grant you that  that it was trying to be helpful to this president and this administration so it appears there was some degree of cooperation in this process that the white house granted chairman nunes making it not just an investigative action but a cooperative one mr spicer right so i would refer you to two things number one weve asked both of these entities both the house and the senate intelligence committees to undertake this review so it is partially at our request that theyre looking into thisnumber two based on the public comments that he made to margarets organization he has said from my understanding on the record that he did not meet with white house staff so again i think youre trying to making something that he  is himself from what ive read not actually been the caseq  thats not what i asked you i asked you about cooperation to have access to a scif which is something that has to be carried out with your mr spicer i understand i will be glad to take a look at that and figure out whether or not that is an accurate statement or notq  okay let me ask you about jared there is an understanding thats trying to be worked out as we understand it between jared and the senate intelligence committee is that a testimony is that something that the committee has requested has he volunteered does he believe he has something to explain to that committee and more broadly the american public about what he did on behalf of the transition with whom he met with and some of the meetings that he took that are raising questions about russia and folks that he met with that are outside of diplomatic channels but have other aspects to their russian business deals that may cause some stirmr spicer so throughout the campaign and the transition jared served as the official primary point of contact with foreign governments and officials until we had state department officials up once we assumed q  inaudible requestmr spicer thats correct and so given this role he volunteered to speak with chairman burrs committee but has not received any confirmation regarding a time for a meeting or anythingq  and is this going to be a private meeting or is this going to be mr spicer i dont know again q  what is he trying to accomplish with thatmr spicer i think based on the questions that surround this he volunteered to go in and sit down with them and say hey im glad to talk about the role that i played and the individuals i met with but again remember given the role that he played both during the campaign and during the transition he met with countless individuals that was part of his job that was part of his role and he executed it completely as he was supposed to q  and so he doesnt believe he owes the american public an explanationmr spicer for what doing his job q  im just askingmr spicer but youre acting as though theres something nefarious about doing what he was actually tasked to doq  well its not every day that someone in a senior position like jareds volunteers to go talk to the senate intelligence committee about an investigation dealing with meddling by a foreign power in an american election mr spicer and i think based on the media frenzy around this he q  im just askingmr spicer and im answering it and im just saying to you that based on the media frenzy that existed around this he volunteered to make sure that they  he said hey weve made some contacts id be glad to explain them let me know if youd like to talk plain and simple q  just to be clear just to kind of follow up on what everyone has been asking about chairman nunes  so the white house does not  does the white house have knowledge of the information that chairman nunes received when he came to the white house the first time and if thats the case or if thats not the case is your position that the white house is not going to look into where he got the information from or who gave him the information until his investigation is completemr spicer i think that  im not aware of where he got it from i know in his public statements hes talked about having multiple sources and so i dont know how he derived the conclusion that he did and i think that at this point the goal would be to wait until the review that he is undertaking is completedkaitlanq  why would nunes need to brief the president on documents he viewed on white house groundsmr spicer because thats a big assumption that youre making that thats the only thing as i said just a second ago he had multiple sources on multiple topics we dont know what he briefed him on in its totality and so to jump to that conclusion is frankly irresponsibleq  one more question when will the white house resume releasing visitor logsmr spicer were reviewing that nowalexisq  just to follow up  i have two questions one is on taxes but last week you were advising the press corps that it didnt make sense for nunes to come to the white house to brief the president on something that he had obtained from the white house from the administration so my question to you is  i know what you just said but can you say factually absolutely flatly that it is not possible that chairman nunes came to brief the president on something that he obtained from the white house or the administrationmr spicer i cant say  percent that i know anything what he briefed him on what i can tell you through his public comments is that he has said that he had multiple sources that he came to a conclusion on so to the degree to which any of those sources weighed on the ultimate outcome of what he came to a decision on i dont know and thats something that frankly i dont even know that he discussed with the presidentq  so its possible as far as you know right now its possiblemr spicer anything is possibleq  okay heres my question on taxes the president has said in the past that he thought maybe tax reform would flow over into   calendar year  and we know from the presidents admiration of the  tax reform that took more than two years can you answer two questions about tax reform does the president anticipate that it will take that long going into  or beyond and who is going to write the tax legislation who is going to devise the plan that the president wants to put his name onmr spicer well so on the first one i know that secretary mnuchin has talked about august as a target date and i think it depends i mean as you point out these are big things theres a lot of groups that are going to want a ton of input because of the very nature that its been  years but i think part of this is going to be dependent on whether  the degree to which we can come to consensus on a lot of big issues but i know that we have a goal and it will depend on a lot of these issues both on the corporate side and on the individual side how that process evolvesso to predict it  i know the secretary would like to have it done hell play a huge role in this gary cohn will play a big role in it i think our legislative affairs team will play a role in it theres a lot of folks on the team  secretary ross on the commerce side theres a lot of individuals  hes assembled a worldclass cabinet that has a lot of interest in helping to grow the economy to attract jobs create a more favorable tax climate here in the country but also provide tax relief for middleclass americansso were not there yetq  so will it would be the trump planmr spicer whatq  will it be the presidents planmr spicer i mean obviously were driving the train on this so i mean were going to work with congress on this but i think the president as youve heard multiple times the president be very clear  this is a huge priority for him and something that he feels very passionately about and so well have more on that laterjohnq  sean the documents that chairman nunes saw here at the white house complex are described by his office as being executive branch documents in the early days after the president sent out that tweet the white house was digging around for anything to corroborate what the president had tweeted out why did it take the intelligence committee chairman coming here to the white house to view executive branch documents to uncover this information why couldnt the white housemr spicer well as i mentioned i think to margaret im not going to  i will stick to what the chairman has said publicly and my understanding from his public comments are that there are certain systems that he doesnt have access to that was his explanation and im going to  i think you should follow up with him on thatq  did the white house ever search the same documents that the chairman searchedmr spicer i dont know what he found so therefore it would be hard to say  to make an assessment of what he was briefed on or what we know so thats a really hard question to answer at this pointq  is it possible that these documents were merely surveillance reports that were mr spicer im not going to get into hypotheticals john i dont know what he found and to start to say whats possible whats not i dont knowq  well let me just finish if i could is it possible that these were surveillance reports from security clearances that were collected after people had filled out standard form mr spicer i dont know i dont know what he  i honestly dont know what hes got on his systems and what the intel community has on theirs that he wouldnt have access to so i dont know what he would have had access to alreadyeamonq  thanks sean on tax cuts it looks like you guys got a little bit of political cover from the house freedom caucus over the weekend to do this without paying for all of it  that is adding to the deficit whats the right number from the white houses perspective to add to the deficit in order to do tax cuts how high are you willing to go in terms of deficitmr spicer its a really early question to be asking at this point i think the question is as we construct this both on the corporate side and then on the individual side i think part of it is its going to be an equation that isnt just driven by that but more whats going to attract jobs whats going to help us build whats going to grow the economy i think were growing around  potentially growing around  and the president really would like to see that growth right up in the high s s and s and so theres a question about what part of tax reform especially on the corporate side will help us spur the economy and grow jobsand i think thats an ongoing discussion i think thats more of the driver of this and then i think as it evolves well have the score and well know moreq  are you comfortable entirely adding to the deficit or do you think something needs to be offset maybe some other spending cuts somewhere elsemr spicer youre asking really early in the process to make that kind of analysis before we have a policy set forth or have any kind of notion of what a score would look likeoliviermr spicer thanks sean theres been an escalation of the american role in the war against the islamic state youve seen marines come ashore in syria there have been changes to rules of engagement im trying to understand the relationship between that change and the presidents isis strategy review has he personally signed off on all the changes in americas posture in the field since january th is that something thats left up to the commanders in the field i dont understand the relationship between mr spicer well it depends on which mission youre talking about specifically or q  marines left in i think october they obviously went ashore much more recently than that so did he have to sign off on thatmr spicer i think it depends on  i mean he speaks with general mattis his national security team very regularly im not going to get into some of the details of what comes up in those settings but i will say that as ive noted in the past i think philosophically the president has made it very clear that he wants to give the commanders on the ground much more flexibility to execute their mission especially when it comes to defeating isis thats a very big change in philosophy but i think it also depends on the magnitude of the mission the number of ground troops in particular and so this is an ongoing discussion that he has with secretary mattis chairman dunford and othersq  so on the review are you waiting  is the president waiting until the review is complete before you announce sort of a new posture and new strategy or is it as conclusions come in youre adapting day to daymr spicer i think some of it is an ongoing discussion that hes having with both chairman dunford of the joint chiefs and secretary mattis of dod at certain times when they meet theyll update him on certain things and give him an update on where theyre headed right now as the review is ongoing theres certain events that are part of  will be part and parcel of the review in terms of where were going and so theyll update him on that and talk to him about the tweaksgabiq  thank you sean president trump has sent out two tweets now criticizing members of the house freedom caucus for preventing planned parenthood from being defunded by opposing the ahca is that something that he would want to see tacked on as a rider to next months spending billmr spicer well i think that hes made very clear what his position is on planned parenthood and obviously this was an opportunity to defund it but i dont want to get ahead of our legislative strategy well look at other opportunities but this is definitely one that was a way to make that happensteveq  on that legislative strategy and the idea of working with democrats theres a school of thought in this town that last week proved that the president is lacking in political capital so i have two questions one is whats in it for democrats to work with the president now and two if fully pursued and to get things through the house democrats and republicans work together wouldnt that tend to undermine the job security of speaker ryan if the house freedom caucus is frozen outmr spicer well so two things number one i think the message that sends to the american  as i mentioned to i think it was jonathan at the beginning its a twoway street we heard  when you see whether its judge gorsuch which theyre throwing down decades of senate tradition by saying were just going to filibuster this guy  i dont think theres anyone in america that can honestly look at his qualifications and suggest that hes not qualified as a jurist on the supreme court i mean theres nothing that anyone has seen or laid a glove on him through these four days that suggests that hes not qualified to serveand i think that its a  and again with obamacare repealing and replacing it several of the leading democrats came out from the getgo and said we have no interest in doing that so i think theres a point at which both parties can look back and figure out whether or not its worth engaging i think the president as i mentioned is eager to get to  on a lot of his initiatives whether its tax reform infrastructure there are a lot of things and i think that he is going to be willing to listen to other voices on the other side to figure out if people want to work with him to get these big things done to make washington work to enhance the lives of the american people then hes going to work with themi think he had a great meeting with the cbc the other day for example where he talked about infrastructure he talked about loans and small business lending education there are things that he is willing to engage individuals with  or groups or caucuses  to get to  and further advance his agendaso its not about undermining anybody its about moving the agenda forward and getting things done q  its speaker ryan who puts bills on the floor not the president so whats in it for speaker ryanmr spicer getting things done i think there is still a sense of doing whats in the best interest of this country that exists so i mean lets just make sure that we understand  i think that his goal  he came here to get things done and i think as was pointed out there was a level of disappointment that he expressed on friday he wants to get things done if people want to work together  and i think what this event on friday did was frankly draw more people into the process to saying okay lets figure out if we can actually come together with some consensus ideas to get to  whether or not they come from one side of the aisle or the other to pass this bill and make a better systemhe understands  and frankly i think a lot of democrats do  that theres an opportunity here with healthcare being such a big issue with obamacare being such a looming disaster that we have an opportunity to do some stuff and if democrats want to join in then thats great and well do thatmikeq  youve talked quite a bit up there about the wide latitude that secretary price has to dismantle obamacare from this spot is that still the case will he continue to try to dismantle obamacare while youre trying to work with moderate democrats on healthcare reform and also the healthcare bill would have repealed almost all those obamacare taxes do you want to see those repealed as part of the tax reform billmr spicer i think secretary price is up here today theres a lot of meetings that are already taking place internally with the team theres a lot of options that are on the table in terms of  especially when it comes to what we call phase one and phase two trying to get some of that stuff out the door and as we look back on  talking about lessons learned i think one of them is to try to get some of the phase one and phase two meshed together and pushed out how we do that whether we wait for the revival of legislation before we put it up  remember i think  just so were clear and i mentioned earlier on this  obamacare had a ton of fits and starts during its process it was left for dead multiple times but they pressed forward i dont think that thats necessarily a model to look for in terms of how they jammed it down but i do think that we have to recognize that we were   days into this processi think the president has made very clear its not over there are people coming to the table but hes going to listen to all good ideas across the spectrum to figure out what it takes to get to  and well see where we go from therejohnq  the tax question to follow up on the  the healthcare bill would have repealed those obamacare taxesmr spicer and i think thats part and parcel of that discussion is how we look at both the taxes and some of the phase one stuff but were not ready to announce anything nowjon deckerq  yeah as far as jared kushners offer to meet with chairman burr and talk with the senate intelligence committee is there any particular reason why the white house would not be opposed to the idea of jared kushner testifying under oath before that committeemr spicer again jared volunteered to meet with the committee they havent even confirmed having a meeting yet so to get ahead of what theyve even asked for would be a little sillyq  but does it set in the white houses view a dangerous precedent in having a senior aide to the president going up ordinarily we see sometimes the white house invoking executive privilege why havent you done this in this particular casemr spicer because i think jared did a job during the transition in the campaign where he was a conduit to leaders and thats until we had a state department  a functioning place for people to go remember we had a delay in some of these things and that was his role and he wants to make sure that hes very clear about the role that he played who he talked to and thats itjimq  is obamacare repeal deadmr spicer i dont think its dead in the sense q  or it would have to be dead if youre going to have democrats working with you to address the affordable care actmr spicer why no no no i dont know that thats true because i think its q  why would they work with you if mr spicer because its dyingq   youre still trying to repeal itmr spicer because i think part of it is is theres a recognition that it is failing its dying on its own it will be dead soonq  a lot of democrats say its not dyingmr spicer okay well then a lot of democrats need to get more money because q  there are repairs that need to be made they say but to kill the whole thing might not be the route they want to gomr spicer i understand what they want but i think theres a difference i think that we recognize that premiums continue to go skyhigh deductibles are going skyhigh choices are going down by leader pelosis own metric this is dying shes the one who crafted the metric she said that there was a threepronged system to determining its success it is an abysmal failure if they want to come back to the table and recognize how we can do it in a more responsible way to achieve the goals that obamacare set out to do  but do so in a way that is going to do the opposite of what obamacare actually did which is to increase choice drive down cost  were willing to have that discussion but right now q  they say repeal has to be put to the sidemr spicer right but jim one of the things that i mentioned  i just want to be clear on this  is we have to figure out how we get to   depending on where the number is that given day that doesnt mean we need the entire democratic caucus that means we need some responsible democrats who want to sit down and have a discussion about how to do that and i think that there may be enough of them that are willing to do that but i understand where the democratic leadership is and thats one thing i mean they continue to stake out a very very farleft position thats not where all their members are and i think that we can  based on the calls that have come in over the last   hours i think that there might be some room to have a conversation with people who want to engage in a constructive conversation on how to move forwardso lets see how that evolves i dont know that were ready to jump into this today but i think as the calls come forward the presidents view is if you all want to get together and start coming to a way that we can come to resolution were willing to listen but right now weve got an agenda to continue to pursueq  there might be a middle ground there you thinkmr spicer im not going to jump ahead but i will say that we believe that there is something that could still be done at some point and i think the further along we go where premiums continue to go up more and more people will be drawn into this discussion because there is going to be a continued cry from people in terms of the impact that its having on their pocketbook and on their ability to see people that  a doctor of their choice or a plan thats just not seeing them anymoreq  a real quick followup on chairman nunes do you reject that there is any kind of perception problem whatsoever in having the chairman over here the day before he comes out publicly and says by the way theres this information thats helpful to the presidentmr spicer well i think the chairman has made very clear through his public comments what his goal was and i think anyone who wants to  i mean you cant ask someone to do a review of the situation and then sort of create inferences because theyre reviewing a situation that theres something thats not right about that he is reviewing a situation he did exactly  and i think hes been fairly open with the press as far as what he was doing who he spoke to and why and i think you know from our standpoint thats what we had asked to do is a reviewaprilq  sean several topics one mr spicer shocker laughterq  dont be you heard the question that i lobbed at the attorney general about the hate crime that happened in new york  the white supremacist who went to new york and targeted a black man hate crimes are on the rise what do you say what is this white house saying about this obvious apparent hate crimemr spicer im not going to  i mean you yelled at the attorney general a specific case if im q  the white house in the past had talked about this and you talked about issues of hate crimes mr spicer im glad to talk about the issues i just want to be very clear that i am not going to reference any specific case before the doj right now i will say that the president has recognized that we need to bring the country together he wants to unite this country he wants to bring people together he had a very long conversation with respect to race in itself which i think is somewhat  if im not correct in your question q  inaudiblemr spicer okay i just want to be clear thank you and i think that was one of the topics that he talked about with the cbc some of the issues with respect to crime and education and some of the solutions that they suggested that could be done during their meeting and i think those are the kind of things that i think we can continue that conversationq  sean unfortunately there has been a rise in hate crimes when it comes to different groups to include antisemitic crimes youve commented from that podium  this is clear  this gentleman in his jailhouse gave a statement to a reporter talking about he wishes the man were younger and he was a thug that killed so what do you say to this this is clear  its racism at its ugliestmr spicer two issues number one i think hate crimes antisemitic crimes of any nature should be called out in the most reprehensible way there is no room for that in our country and i think the president noted that in the joint address that there is one issue that despite policy should unite us  and that is calling out hate that is calling out divisiveness based on the color of ones skin ones religion ones gender the president has been very clear on that and hes called it out before with respect to certain particular situations he made it very clear at the opening of his joint address thats what he led with  is a call to denounce hate no matter where we come from politically hes also talked about it the night that he took the stage on that wednesday morning around  am about how one of the things that he needed to do and wanted to do as president was unite all americansbut i think that theres one other piece to this april that i just want to be clear on while we unequivocally  no question about it  need to call out hate antisemitism where it exists there is another thing that we have to do and in your case in particular while i dont know all of the details and i dont want to reference any specific case  but i think we saw this the other day with some of the antisemitic behavior that was going out with respect to people of the jewish faith is that we saw these threats coming into jewish community centers and there was an immediate jump to criticize folks on the right and to denounce people on the right and ask them to condemn them and it turns out that in fact it wasnt someone on the right and it was  and the president from the getgo had said i bet you its not someone  and he was right and yet q  im not calling this mr spicer hold on i understand that and thats q   saying hes a white supremacistmr spicer i understand that and i think in those cases theres no question  black and white  we need to call out all instances of thisthat being said while were on the topic i do think that there has been a rush to judgement in a lot of other cases when it comes to  in particular some of the antisemitic discussion  where people have jumped to the conclusion about denouncing people on the right and asking for this and in that particular case we saw that the president was right and that this rush to judgment by a lot of folks on the left was wrong and none of them have been held to account on that and that is something that equally needs to be called out when people are charging something of someone that is not true there has been nothing to go back to those individuals  nothing  on the left who came and asked for everyone on the right to denounce something that they werent guilty of and i think that there needs to be an equal  go back in time and call out those individuals for rushing to judgment and calling out those individualsq  and my second topic and im done someone who was in the room  you like talking about the cbc meeting that happened last week someone who was actually in the room at that meeting said that the issue of hbcus came up  and thats a very sensitive subject right now in the black community and here at the white house the issue of hbcus came up and omarosa said that she would be the one heading the hbcu office at the white house and the president did not make a response confirming or denying will this be the case is this the casemr spicer we dont have any announcements to make i assume that youre referring to the executive order and we dont have anything to announce on that subject at this timekristenq  sean thank you given that the freedom caucus blocked the bill to repeal and replace obamacare does the president still believe he can work with the freedom caucus on future pieces of legislationmr spicer i think its going to depend on what legislation q  so not necessarilymr spicer well again im not going to  its not a question of  were going to work with anybody who wants to work with us on achieving the goals the president set out i dont think  were not putting anyone and saying well never work with you again it is that balance q  has he written them offmr spicer no i dont think hes written  no i think as he mentioned he learned a lot through this process about loyalty and its not just a bloc its certain individuals and again im not going to get into naming names but i think the president learned a lot through this process and one of the things thats interesting is when you look back  and i know theres been a lot to make of this  the president also recognizes when theres not a deal to be made when to walk away thats one of the traits  its not just about making deals its knowing when to walk away from deals and knowing when theres a bad deal thats the only solution and i think the president understood that while you can get a deal at the time that sometimes a bad deal is worse than getting a deal and i think he smartly recognized that what was on the table was not going to be keeping with the vision that he had and so he decided that this was not the time and that a deal was not at handq  let me ask you about this tweet over the weekend does he regret tweeting to his followers that they should tune in to judge jeanine only to tune in and then have her call for house speaker paul ryan to step downmr spicer hes a fan of the show thats it plain and simple i mean q  but does he owe speaker ryan an apology thenmr spicer he and speaker ryan talked extensively over the weekendq  did they talk todaymr spicer i dont know if they talked today i think they talked both saturday and sunday at length but again he is a fan of the show he tweeted out support of it thats it plain and simpleq  a lot of people say its a lot more than coincidencemr spicer i know what a lot of people say kristen i just said itq  so does he owe the house speaker an apologymr spicer no he doesnt  he has spoken  for what for supporting a show on fox nodaveq  and does he still have confidence they can work together seanmr spicer daveq  two questions one on the president choosing jared kushner for this new office of american innovation to reform government across the government obviously jared kushner has some days of experience in washington  never had a prior government job does the president view that somehow as an advantage in this casemr spicer in some cases when you look at the individuals that hes bringing in again i think one of the things that jared  and again they may talk more about this later  but one of the things that jared is looking at is some of the procurement  the technology aspects and if youve ever really dealt with the government and recognized how outdated and unmodernized some of this is it is not serving the american people it is not serving the constituents that many departments have and i think looking at how we procure different things and procure technology in particular is important its an important way  i mean i think when you look at the va in particular and recognize how it handles certain things  there are certain things it does really well by the way it buys prescription drugs really well it buys them in bulk  gets the job done but theres certain things that it may not do as well in terms of how it keeps its records and how it serves veterans how it lends money et cetera  that we can look at and figure out is there a better way government is not business right we recognize that there are certain things that business would never do in terms of what government has to do because we serve all of our people but there are certain practices that we can put in place that can help us deliver a better product a better service to the american people in some of these key areas and i think that when you look at some of the business acumen that jared and some of the other individuals who he is bringing into this process can really  i think it is a great service to this country there are so many individuals that jared has talked that have done so well and been so blessed by our nation that have wanted to give back in some way shape or form and are using this opportunity to help our country and serve our country in ways that they believe they can use their expertise to doq  on healthcare this review that youve talked about  what went right what went wrong  i know you dont want to name names but would it be fair to say at this point that the president has written off some peoplemr spicer i just  i think i answered that question its not a question of written them off its a question of understanding  theres sort of an understanding of how you deal with certain people and how they dealt with you but its not a question of writing them off were going to need to get to  as time goes on well get to  im just going to keep saying  its easier i wont screw that one up down the line but i think that we recognize that as we go down this path of a big bold agenda that the president has that were going to need every vote we can and hopefully grow the vote in some cases to well beyond that but were not writing off anybody but we do recognize there are some lessons learned form this process and the president made it very clear on fridaythank you guys very much ill see you tomorrow enjoy the dayend pm edt

2017-03-24,Remarks by President Trump on the Health Care Bill ,oval office pm edtthe president thank you very much we were very close and it was a very very tight margin we had no democrat support we had no votes from the democrats they werent going to give us a single vote so its a very difficult thing to doive been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do politically speaking is let obamacare explode it is exploding right now many states have big problems  almost all states have big problems i was in tennessee the other day and theyve lost half of their state in terms of an insurer they have no insurer and thats happened to many other places i was in kentucky the other day and similar things are happeningso obamacare is exploding with no democrat support we couldnt quite get there we were just a very small number of votes short in terms of getting our bill passed a lot of people dont realize how good our bill was because they were viewing phase one but when you add phase two  which was mostly the signings of secretary price whos behind me  and you add phase three which i think we would have gotten  it became a great bill premiums would have gone down and it would have been very stable it would have been very strong but thats okay but were very very close and again i think what will happen is obamacare unfortunately will explode its going to have a very bad year last year you had over a  percent increases in various places in arizona i understand its going up very rapidly again like it did last year last year it was  percent many places    percent i guess it averaged  whatever the average was  very very high  and this year should be much worse for obamacareso what would be really good with no democrat support is if the democrats when it explodes  which it will soon  if they got together with us and got a real healthcare bill i would be totally up to do it and i think thats going to happen i think the losers are nancy pelosi and chuck schumer because now they own obamacare they own it   percent own it and this is not a republican healthcare this is not anything but a democrat healthcare and they have obamacare for a little while longer until it ceases to exist which it will at some point in the near future and just remember this is not our bill this is their billnow when they all become civilized and get together and try and work out a great healthcare bill for the people of this country were open to it were totally open to it i want to thank the republican party i want to thank paul ryan  he worked very very hard i will tell you that he worked very very hard tom price and mike pence  whos right here  our vice president our great vice president everybody worked hard i worked as a team player and would have loved to have seen it passed but again i think you know i was very clear i think there wasnt a speech i made or very few where i didnt mention that perhaps the best thing that can happen is exactly what happened today because well end up with a truly great healthcare bill in the future after this mess known as obamacare explodesso i want to thank everybody for being here it will go very smoothly i really believe i think this is something  it certainly was an interesting period of time we all learned a lot we learned a lot about loyalty we learned a lot about the votegetting process we learned a lot about some very arcane rules in obviously both the senate and in the house so its been  certainly for me its been a very interesting experience but in the end i think its going to be an experience that leads to an even better healthcare plan so thank you all very much and ill see you soonq  mr president is it now your intention to go for tax reform or whats next on your priority listthe president well be going right now for tax reform which we could have done earlier but this really would have worked out better if we could have had some democrat support remember this we had no democrat support so now were going to go for tax reform which ive always likedq  and youre confident in speaker ryans leadership and his ability to get things donethe president yes i am i like speaker ryan he worked very very hard a lot of different groups hes got a lot of factions and theres been a long history of liking and disliking even within the republican party long before i got here but ive had a great relationship with the republican party it seems that both sides like trump and thats good and you see that i guess more clearly than anybodybut weve had a  im not going to speak badly about anybody within the party but certainly theres a big history i think paul really worked hard and i would say that we will probably start going very very strong for the big tax cuts and tax reform that will be nextq  sir is it fair to americans to let obamacare explodethe president well its going to happen theres not much you can do about it its going to  bad things are going to happen to obamacare theres not much you can do to help it ive been saying that for a year and a half i said look eventually its not sustainable the insurance companies are leaving  you know that theyre leaving one by one as quick as you can leave and you have states in some cases who will not be covered so theres no way out of thatbut the one thing that was happening as we got closer and closer everybody was talking about how wonderful it was and now well go back to real life and people will see how bad it is and its getting much worse you know i said the other day when president obama left   he knew he wasnt going to be here  is going to be a very very bad year for obamacare very very bad youre going to have explosive premium increases and the deductibles are so high people dont even get to use itso theyll go with that for a little while and i honestly believe  i know some of the democrats and theyre good people  i honestly believe the democrats will come to us and say look lets get together and get a great healthcare bill or plan thats really great for the people of our country and i think thats going to happenq  if you could have passed the bill in the house without any democratic support why do you think you werent able to craft a deal among the republican partythe president well we were very close we were just probably anywhere from  to  votes short could have even been closer than that youll never know because youll never know how they vote but in the end i think we would have been  votes maybe closer and it was very hard to get almost  percent youre talking about a very very large number of votes  among any group and we were very close to doing it but when you get no votes from the other side  meaning the democrats  its really a difficult situationq  will you reach out to the democrats nowthe president no i think we have to let obamacare go its way for a little while and well see how things go id love to see it do well but it cant i mean it cant its not a question of gee  i hope it does well i would love it to do well i want great healthcare for the people of this nation but it cant do well its imploding and soon will explode and its not going to be prettyso the democrats dont want to see that so theyre going to reach out when theyre ready and whenever theyre ready were readyq  do you feel betrayed by the house freedom caucus at all they seemed to be the most difficult to getthe president no im not betrayed theyre friends of mine im disappointed because we could have had it so im disappointed im a little surprised to be honest with you we really had it it was pretty much there within grasp but ill tell you whats going to come out of it is a better bill  i really believe a better bill because there were things in this bill i didnt particularly love and i think its a better bill you know both parties can get together and do real healthcare thats the best thing obamacare was rammed down everyones throat   percent democrat and i think having bipartisan would be a big big improvement so no i think that this is going to end up being a very good thing im disappointed but theyre friends of mine and they got  this is a very hard time for them and a very hard vote but theyre very good peopleq  you mentioned that there were things in this bill that you didnt necessarily love what specifically are thosethe president well i think we could have things that i would have liked more and if we had bipartisan i really think we could have a healthcare bill that would be the ultimate and i think the democrats know that also and some day in the nottoodistant future that will happen and i never said  i guess im here what  days i never said repeal and replace obamacare  youve all heard my speeches  i never said repeal it and replace it within  days i have a long time but i want to have a great healthcare bill and plan  and we will it will happen and it wont be in the very distant future i really believe there will be some democrat support and that will happen and it will be an even better bill i think this was a very good bill i think it will be even better the next time around i dont think thats going to be in too long a period of timeq  anything specifically you want to see changed going from this bill to the next billthe president no i mean i dont want to speak about specifics but there are things i could have  i would have liked even more but i feel overall this was a very very good bill and i thought tom price  dr tom price  who really is amazing on healthcare his knowledge  i thought he did a fantastic job same with mike pence i think these two guys  they worked so hard and really did a fantastic jobthank you very much thank you end  pm edt

2017-03-24,Daily Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer - #28 ,james s brady press briefing room pm edtmr spicer good afternoon everyone theres a lot going on today so im going to keep this on the briefer sidethis morning the president announced the official approval of the presidential permit for the keystone xl pipeline the last administration spent eight years delaying this enormous investment in american energy independence president trump is moving this project forward in just eight weeks and just as he promised its an even better deal for the american people than before he took office this project will directly generate an estimated  jobs according to the state department  all without spending a dime of taxpayer money in many ways this project represented everything that was wrong with the infrastructure permitting of the united states transcanada spent an incredible amount of resources attempting to comply with government regulations only to be denied and delayed for political reasons but the days of pointless government bureaucracy holding up progress and production have ended by simply getting excessive duplicative regulations out of the way we can make infrastructure projects more attractive  a more attractive prospect for private investors and encourage even more projects like this oneimmediately following the announcement by transcanada the president announced that charter communications has committed to investing  billion here in the united states and hiring an additional  american workers over the next four yearscharter communications is truly an example of how american leadership can turn a downturn entity into an amazing successfive years ago charter communications was a struggling company that had slowly emerged from bankruptcy today thanks to hard work and great leadership of chairman and ceo tom rutledge it is the fastestgrowing television internet and voice company in the nation and most importantly as charter grew american jobs grew as they brought back many jobs that had previously been shipped overseas today charter is also committed to completely ending its offshore call centers basing  percent of them in the united states together the transcanada and charter communications announcement demonstrate the new economic model of what the president called the american model by slashing jobkilling regulations and reducing government burdens and lowering taxes we will make it easier for all businesses to grow right here at home generating jobs and boosting our economy by getting government out of the wayfollowing these big announcements the president had lunch with secretary of the treasury steve mnuchin he was joined by speaker paul ryan  ill get to in a second on that later in the afternoon the president will host a greek independence day celebration and as i mentioned yesterday at  oclock he will meet with about two dozen medal of honor recipients to honor medal of honor day which is technically tomorrow hes honored to be hosting these great men and women of our armed services the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever knownand obviously later today the house will be voting on the american health care act the current vote is scheduled for  pm the president has been working the phones and having inperson meetings since the american health care act was introduced hes left everything on the field when it comes to this bill the president and congressional republicans promised the american people that they would repeal and replace this broken system obamacares washingtondriven onesizefitsall plan had seven years to prove its case and look what its left us withskyrocketing premiums  on average premiums for obamacare benchmark plans increased  percent in  unaffordable deductibles  the two most popular obamacare health plans have average deductibles equivalent to  percent and  percent of the median american household income with these high deductibles many people have technically insurance but nothing that they can afford to use fewer choices  one in five americans have only one insurer offering obamacare through exchanges and of course higher taxeskey conservative groups like the tea party express and the american conservative union have added themselves to a long list of organizations expressing their support for the american health care act because they know its our chance after the american people have spent years suffering to finally repeal and replace the nightmare of obamacare the president looks forward to seeing the house republicans join with these influential voices and vote in favor of the american health care act the president as i mentioned had speaker ryan come up here and visit with him to update him on the bill they are continuing to discuss the way forward on this the speaker is updating him on his efforts as i mentioned to you the president has been working throughout the week on this calling early  starting early in the morning and working till late at night calling with members visiting members by our count over  members have personally had a visit call or meeting here at the white house in the past few days this is an extraordinary feat the president and his team have committed everything they can to making this thing happen and the speaker is going to continue to update him on the way forwardfinally a few administrative notes here at the end yesterday seniorlevel united states and israeli delegations concluded four days of intensive talks with a particular focus on concrete nearterm measures to improve the overall climate in order to advance the prospects of a genuine and lasting peace between israel and palestine the united states delegation was led by jason greenblatt special representative for international negotiation and included representatives of the nsc and the department of statea principal focus of the discussion was specific measures that could have a meaningful impact on the economic environment in the west bank and gaza allowing the palestinians to more fully realize their economic potentialthe two delegations also discussed israeli settlement construction the fact that both governments dedicated such senior delegations for so many days reflects the close cooperation between these countries and the importance that both assign to this vital tasklast night the president announced his intention to nominate several key additional people to the administration including althea coatzee to be deputy administrator of the small business administration william francis hagerty iv to be ambassador to japan robert sumwalt iii to be a member of the national transportation safety board and also this morning of note the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia upheld the presidents revised executive order protecting the nation from foreign people who seek to do us harm into the united states were pleased with this ruling which found the plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the merits of their claims as the court correctly notes in its opinion the presidents order falls well within his legal authority to protect the nations security were confident the presidents fully lawful and necessary action will ultimately be allowed to move forward through the rest of the system  court systemin terms of the schedule for this weekend the president will spend a working weekend here in washington and well update you with further details regarding his schedulewith that ill get to your questions steveq  sean is it your understanding that you dont have the votes to pass the healthcare legislation is that the message that speaker ryan delivered today and if so what lessons do you draw from this processmr spicer well i think the speaker is currently having a conversation with him to talk about where that vote count stands hes working with the members of  you know the president made a sell they had the tuesday group here there were  members here  walked out as a yes i think weve had a group of members that weve continued to have a conversation with and try to make  frankly at this point its not a question of negotiating anymore its understanding the greater good thats at hand the president understands this is it we had this opportunity to change the trajectory of healthcare to help improve  put a healthcare system in place and to end the nightmare that republicans have campaigned on called obamacare i noted yesterday it was the seventhyear anniversary of obamacare we have an opportunity to make sure that was the last one and the question is do members realize this opportunitytheres no question in my mind at least that the president and the team here have left everything on the field he has called every member that had a question or concern tried to to the extent possible take into consideration ideas that would strengthen the bill and its now going to be up to the members of the house to decide whether or not they want to follow through on the promise to thatbut were going to continue to work with the speaker and the leadership there to see where the votes are were getting closer and closer but you need to get to  and theyre starting four hours of debate i expect a vote somewhere around  oclock hour well see where we gohunterq  thank you sean were hearing that paul ryan and mitch mcconnell wanted to do a clean repeal and then replace over time in retrospect would that have been a better approach and in general do you think paul ryan has handled this wellmr spicer i dont know that thats entirely the case i know that this was a joint effort this is something that the house determined in terms of the threepronged approach that we had so i dont know that i necessarily agree with the assessment of how that happenedq  and in general is the white house happy with how paul ryan has handled thismr spicer i think the speaker has done everything he can hes worked really closely with the president i think at the end of the day  i said this yesterday  you cant force people to vote but i think weve given them every single reason to fulfill every pledge that theyve made and i think this is the right thing to domaggie i dont want you to livetweet this thingq  thank you sean what is the white houses view if this does not pass and there arent the votes what does this mean going forward for other pieces of the presidents agenda  tax reform being the big onemr spicer look ive said it before i dont think you can tie any of these together thats just not  i think theres a huge appetite for tax reform and im not trying to juxtapose anything to do with todays vote or not i think it will be great to see it put forward the president has put a lot of time and effort into this and i think hes made a strong case as to why this has to happen and i think weve worked with the houseif we dont get  regardless of what happens today  and i still feel optimistic that the speaker and the president and the vice president  weve got a team thats been up on the hill most of today  theyre going to continue to try to get every vote they can but that doesnt mean  whether its immigration or tax reform theres still a huge appetite out thereq  just to be clear i mean if this fails today is the president done with healthcaremr spicer so negative laughter q  thats what were hearingmr spicer thats what youre hearing well i havent heard that yet so why dont we continue with a very positive optimistic friday the sun is coming out laughter i feel really good so were going to continue to work as late as we can to get the votes and as i said the upside is that we continue to pick up votes people continue to say that they want to  the question is can we get to but make no mistake about it the president made it clear last night  this is it you have an opportunity to do what youve told the american people the commitment that we as a party have made but this is your chance to do what weve done weve listened weve incorporated weve updated in every way possible i dont think  when you look at legislative efforts i think the president has given it his all and i think it shocked a lot of people frankly how very very detailoriented how personal it was for him  calling members as early as  am in the morning and going to  oclock at night the last several nights sitting down meeting after meeting with them coming back and revising it having his team back and forth everything is out thereand i think each of these members needs to make the decision whether or not they believe that theyve  at some point you can only do so much is what i would honestly tell you and i think everything that we could possibly do to listen to members to get their concerns in this piece of legislation to make it as strong as possible for the american people has been doneq  but is the president comfortable then with obamacare continuing and what does he say to his supportersmr spicer no hes not i mean of course hes notq  i mean they voted for him with the promise that he would repeal thismr spicer i mean im not even sure where to start with that no hes not which is why hes literally put as much effort as he has into repealing this but hes made it clear that this is our moment this is our opportunity to do it but it is now up to members to make that decision whether or not they want to be part of this effort to repeal obamacare and if they dont  and i think for a lot of the  you saw the presidents tweet this morning  i think for a lot of these members who life is as important as well this is your opportunity but its ultimately them that have to go down in the floor and cast that vote and i think weve been able to cast a bunch of votes over the past couple years when you knew a president wouldnt sign it you have a president thats going to sign the bill if you pass it and now is that timezekeq  some months ago at the republican national convention the president said  i alone can fix it throughout the entire campaign his message to his voters the american people was hes a businessman he knows how to get deals done he knows how to break the gridlock in washington hes the closer is what you said earlier this week if this vote does go down what does this say about the president is the president humbled by this process and will he readjust  how will he readjust the administration going forwardmr spicer lets not  like i said to jill im still optimistic i feel like were continuing to work hard but at the end of the day you cant force somebody to do something i think theres nobody that objectively can look at this effort and say the president didnt do every single thing he possibly could with his team to get every vote possible and i think thats why i still feel good about thisbut we are where we are and members have got to make that decision for themselves this is the final hour to make that decisionblakeq  sean is it under any consideration to pull the bill at all between now and thenmr spicer you guys are so negativeq  well theres reports out there that mr spicer i understand but there are reports out there  the speaker and the president are talking now the leader and the whip are doing their vote counts the debate is ongoing were going to continue  we are proceeding with a  pm vote as scheduledjohnq  take me through some of the  if you dont mind  the thinking yesterday when the bill was pulled and then the president had made the decision  or his team they went to the hill saying theres going to be a vote today at what point did he make that calculation why did he make that calculation can you bring us through some of that thinkingmr spicer yeah i mean theres a couple of things one is i think we wanted to be as open as possible with the vote having it on the current trajectory last night it was going into the wee hours of the morning and i dont think that that  for all that weve talked about that wasnt the appropriate way to vote i think we decided to work with the house and ask that they postpone and make sure that it was done in the light of day but i think that hes had enough discussions and it is not about improving the deal anymore i think he has taken into consideration every members thoughts and concerns and relayed those to the house and i think to the extent that this balance of trying to get to  in this case is such that there are some people that come in with ideas and say if you do that to get your vote im going to give up  or to get these three im going give up  and i think we have struck the right balance right now and incorporated it and its the strongest possible bill but hes going to continue to work as hard as he can until the very endcharlieq  how important is a live vote to the white house and to the president to see whos on the side and whos notmr spicer weve seen the whip counts mr scalise has done a phenomenal job with leader mccarthy of  we know where the vote count stands so we dont need a live vote to tell us where the votes are people have been pretty straightforward with where they are and what their outstanding issues areq  the president and the speaker are meeting right now do you know  can you tell us anything about the character of that meeting or what exactly theyre looking at going forwardmr spicer well theyre discussing theyre not looking theyre sitting down and talking about where it stands some of the outstanding issues and whether theyre onesies or twosies or fives  what are the concerned and outstanding issues of some of the blocs and some of the individuals and having a discussion on thatanitaq  if the bill doesnt pass  mr spicer theres somebody thats going to ask when it passes and you can q  okay well do you want to have a briefing right after the votemr spicer noq  okay laughter mr spicer all right score one for you laughter q  if the bill doesnt pass does the president still have confidence in the speakermr spicer i think he answered that question earlier todayq  well does he think that he should step down if it doesnt get a votemr spicer he answered that question earlier and he said he did so asked and answeredq  and then logistically today after the vote whatever happens how will we get a response from you allmr spicer electronically or verbally but one of the two peterq  thank you sean this is the presidents first foray into lets say the sausagemaking process so to speak has he reflected at all on the experience i mean how does he feel it differs from for example negotiating a real estate deal a business deal is it more complicated is it trickier whats his feeling about thismr spicer i think well have plenty of time to reflect on it after we do this so i know that  ill just leave it at that for nowkristenq  thanks without prejudging the outcome of the vote mr spicer thank you laughter q   does the president in any way regret pursuing healthcare first given how complicated it has beenmr spicer no i think if you think about it legislatively in order to maximize  and i know for most people it doesnt make a ton of sense but the savings that you achieve through the first reconciliation of healthcare which were doing through the  budget process which still continues allows us to utilize the savings in that process to maximize additional tax reform measures that will start in the fy reconciliation processso while that sounds like a ton of insidebaseball gobbledygook the reality is is that in order to maximize tax reform both on the corporate side to make our businesses more competitive and to give individuals especially middleclass americans more tax relief  doing this in that way maximizes the amount of savings that you can use for the second reconciliation package which would be tax reform doing it the first way you can do  but again youre not going to achieve the full potential that you could if you did it the way that is happening nowbut that being said i mean its not a question of  we all knew how big this was  its onefifth of the economy  and what it took the issue is is that i think the disparate interests that are there and some of the processexplaining if you will  the understanding  the way that this is happening and i think legislatively its complicated and for a lot of folks that just understand why cant you do it all in one fell swoop whats the byrd rule whats reconciliation why do you have to do it in three phases i think for a lot of people that is a little bit complicated to understand and its not just a question of understanding i think one of the other things that the president and the team have found is that theres a lot of issues where people are wondering well if i vote for this how can i guarantee that i get something in phase two  which is the administrative pieces that secretary price would institute and then third is  well you know the legislative things that will take  votes they complete the overall package  you know how do i have  and so theres a lot of  the comprehensive nature of this makes it very complicated and i think thats a lot different normally you have one bill that sails through and it deals with all of these things and you can roll it all in if someone has an amendment you add it in in this process were having to have all these oneoff discussions about you know will the senate accept this if you put it in if you put it in will they  not only will they accept it but will the byrd rule take place and kick out the whole thing that complicates this probably like nothing elseq  understood just to put a fine point on it though was it his initial ask to do healthcare first or did house speaker paul ryan say i think this is mr spicer i think was something that during the transition we sat down and gamed out in coordination with the house in terms of what should go first and why but again its not a question of just what should go first its a question of if you dont do it first do you lose some of the potential in savings that you would achieve through the second reconciliationq  wouldnt it have been wiser to try to work with the freedom caucus for example on something like infrastructure reform to build up some goodwill with that caucus and then come back to something more complicated mr spicer no i think  look kristen weve talked about this since  every republican with the exception of probably a handful has campaigned from dog catcher on up that they would do everything they could to repeal and replace obamacare and i think to get in and say hey you should have done something else wouldnt be fair to the american people who have said okay ill vote for you but i want you to fulfill this pledgeq  and just finally does the buck stop with him on thismr spicer well i mean  like i said earlier you cant force someone to vote a certain way i think in the sense that has he done every single thing has he pulled out every stop has he called every member has he tweaked every tweak has he done every single thing he can possibly and used every minute of every day thats possible to get this thing through then the answer is yes has the team put everything out there have we left everything on the field absolutelybut at the end of the day this isnt a dictatorship and weve got to expect members to ultimately vote to  you know how they will according to what they think but i think theyre  as the president made clear theyre the ones who have to go back and answer to their constituents why they didnt fulfill a pledge that they madeq  nonhealthcare question for you regarding these documents that devin nunes says show incidental intelligence collection of identifying information about people associated with the trump campaign can you categorically rule out that chairman nunes received or was alerted to these documents from someone at the white housemr spicer im not aware of where he got the documents from i dont knowq  can you rule out that it came from the white housemr spicer i cant  i dont know where he got them from he didnt state it so i dont have anything for you and so i cannot say anything more than i dont know at this pointceciliaq  so if the president has done everything he can possibly do and the speaker has done everything he can possibly do the team has put everything on the table who is to blame right now for this holdup in your eyesmr spicer well again lets wait and see how this thing  im not assigning blameq  well but you wanted a vote even last night or this morning so there is a stall so from last night to this morning mr spicer no no no we did want a vote last night and i think as i have mentioned as we got into the evening hours the idea wasnt to bury this at  am or  am in the morningq  initially you were asking for one yesterday and there was a statement from your press office that asked for one this morning mr spicer no no  and im not backing away from that we wanted a vote yesterday but as the process went on we realized that that vote would occur in  probably actually into today in terms of like calendarwise and that doing it at  am  am  am in the morning was not something that would be in keeping with what we had promisedq  so who is to blame for the stall right now is it the freedom caucus is it mr spicer i think its not a blame right now its a question of getting all these members together and dealing with all  i mean youve seen the activity youve seen the members go back and forth right now were still in that active discussion phase with trying to figure out who we can get on board and whether or not we can move forwardbut this is  were not there yetq  but you put this ultimatum out there is the president right now still confident that he can see this bill through  that you will repeal and replace obamacaremr spicer the president is confident that we have done every single thing possible made the case updated it added and done everything to listen to the concerns and to do everything that fulfills the promises that we and members have made with the american peoplejohnq  thank you sean without prejudging the outcome of the vote today but focusing on your comments and the presidents saying this would be a vote against life if people vote against it mr spicer rightq   several republican members said they did not want the vote on planned parenthood in this particular bill congressman john faso of new york was particularly outspoken did anything come up in the negotiation or from the white house saying they guarantee a separate vote on planned parenthood and leave it out of the billmr spicer im not aware of that john im not aware that that happenedq  the white house  from your tone and the presidents the white house wanted the planned parenthood vote inmr spicer id have to go back and look at  theres a lot of discussions that go on i honestly cant remember how or when that came upq  the other thing i wanted to ask was that the last two members who announced they were no  chris smith and frank lobiondo republicans of new jersey  both cited the number of medicaid recipients in their district as their premier reason congressman lobiondo said in three counties  percent of his constituents were on medicaid and he wanted no damage was there anything discussed on medicaid was it on the table in the negotiationsmr spicer well i know that that there was a discussion about the expansion of medicaid and some of the work requirements with respect to ablebodied americans who are receiving that but i would say this john  one of the things that  not memberspecific to either of the members from new jersey  is that members have to understand that the current system is unsustainable so if you vote no today then what is your alternative and what do you wantbecause right now theres a lot of folks that have said theyre going to vote no which is their prerogative but at the end of the day the current obamacare system will collapse on its own and so the question that they have to ask themselves or that they are going to be asked by their constituents is then what is your alternative because right now this is the choice that will save the system the other choice is to do nothing and that will  that is going to collapse the system eamonq  thanks sean the stock market has been largely looking at this as a proxy for how youre going to do on your tax cut proposal would you be able to say what the lessons learned here are about how this was handled that might apply to the tax cut proposalmr spicer look eamon ive discussed this earlier im not going to start getting a lessons learned while were in the middle of debate of a current bill well have plenty of time  if you want to stop by over the weekend we can talk about  laughter  to sit down with you on that but again were not  right now were focused on getting the votes the house has a vote scheduled thats what our focus is  not to figure out  well have plenty of time for thatjenq  is the president going to just simply wash his hands of this today if this doesnt go his waymr spicer look were not  the president is going to wash his hands several times but i dont know  laughterq  the central campaign promise of the president of the united states mr spicer i understand that and so what  i get it so slow down lets turn on cspan and all watch this together and then we can discuss what happenedjenq  treasury secretary mnuchin was talking this morning about doing tax reform by the august recess do you think that thats a reasonable timeline and why the rush are there any lessons learned from this healthcare debatemr spicer again i think tax reform is something that weve talked about theres plenty of time i think its a goal and i think its an ambitious one and i think its one that were going to try to stick to but lets get by today and then well lay it outbut i think tax reform is something that the president is very committed to youve seen him very publicly in the last couple of open events talk about how excited he is to move on once this is done to tax reform because he understands both sides of this  that the business piece of this  we are so uncompetitive when it comes to our other worldly competitors in terms of our tax rate and yet when we have these discussions about keeping companies from either shipping jobs overseas or growing  bringing back jobs to america the two things that come up over and over again are our tax rate and our regulatory system and i think he understands that on the tax front we can be a lot more competitive with the rest of the world in growing american jobs here at home and frankly expanding manufacturing if we lower that but also that the american middle class desperately needs and wants a tax break and i think the more that we can do with that  so this is something that i think were going to be continuing to work on and well have more on that latertreyq  sean how much credit will the president take for the outcome of this healthcare billmr spicer im going to refer you to like the last eight people lets see where we go from hereq  quick followupmr spicer yesq  is the white house still as confident as they were earlier in this week and is the president still as confident as he was earlier in the week that this healthcare bill will passmr spicer i would suggest to you its  my answer that i said to kristen is that we are confident that we have done everything and it is now up to voters the president  we  the president called for a vote and respectfully  obviously its not up to us but the reason that he asked speaker ryan and leader mccarthy to call for a vote is weve done everything weve done every single thing that  every meeting every call every discussion every idea has been out there adjudicated listened to and i think that now is the time for the vote and so were a couple hours away and lets see where we goq   level of confidence remainmr spicer i think in the sense of what we did yespeterq  sean the president can order every surveillance transcript that mentions himself or his associates in regards to russia for the investigation that he called for to be brought to his desk at any time has he done thatmr spicer noq  so yesterday you were asked specifically  you said that the concerns should be less about the process and more about the substance i asked because that would be one way to get directly to the substance on the substance devin nunes said initially that he  there was evidence that clearly showed that the presidentelect and his team were at least monitored then today he said  asked if trump or his associates were monitored or mentioned he said we dont know we wont know until we actually receive all the documentationthe president said hes somewhat vindicated so given the fact that devin nunes doesnt actually know if the president was monitored or whether he was even mentioned what is he vindicated bymr spicer well i think that there has been an acknowledgement that there are documents out there showing that people were surveilled or monitored to some degreeq  they could have exclusively been foreigners devin nunes concedesmr spicer devin nunes also made it clear that hes going to have a hearing later next week with several members of the intelligence community and calling others back and so lets wait and see q  well what is the president vindicated bymr spicer the president said he felt somewhat vindicated because i think that there is an acknowledgement that hes  that as we proceed down this discussion it continues to show that there was something there and that despite the constant discussion about the process q  but he said we dont  we wont knowmr spicer hold on peter i understand i get this is i understand that and he also said that hes going to have a hearing and hes going to call the people back and hes waiting for the documents so lets wait and let that process evolveq  thank you sean a couple questions first about keystone what changed it seemed like it took forever in covering the obama administration for this thing to finally get over the finish line it never did and relatively quickly  less than  days in  its finally made its way over the finish line what changed especially with respect to the state departments view of the keystone xl pipeline and is it your opinion that it would be good to hear from the president  win lose or draw  after what we learned today visvis healthcare reformmr spicer so simply put on keystone it was a priority i mean the president came in he signed an executive order on it he had talked about it during the campaign and he made it a priority he made it a priority for his team here at the white house to get it done  not only the jobs but incorporating us steel and  there was a lot of things but i dont think its any simpler than he made it a priority for him his team this administration the department of state and others  and thats it he recognizes the importance of that to both energy and to jobs and our economy and simply got it done and ill leave it up to the president once we go forward to see how it goesmargaretq  sean as a dealmaker why does the president feel that this takeitorleaveit approach is the right one on healthcaremr spicer because i think he has done  i mean at some point youve listened to everybody youve gotten all other ideas youve gone back and forth you have incorporated them youve assuaged them in some way shape or form youve updated the bill  and a lot of times its the same people coming back over and over again and you go okay ive listened to you ive taken your ideas at some point we either have a deal or we dont and i think thats where the president finally drew the line and said weve been having this discussion weve had the meetings and weve done everything possible to address the concerns and ideas and opinions that people have brought up and i mean i dont think you can say it any simpler i think he has done every single thing possible and you end up at some point finding yourself going around and around and saying okay lets just  lets call the voteq  but isnt there a political cost to a collapse potentiallymr spicer i think that at some point theres a political cost to dragging this out as well and saying lets just keep letting it go and i think thats where  you know we came to a decision that it had gotten as far as it can gokaitlanq  if theres a collapse though isnt there a cost that the president will at some point have to pay for if its either mr spicer in terms of whatq  the collapse that you have been predicting mr spicer no i think that  look remember  look this is q  besides the upcoming election in  im talking about economic impact all the impact on the states  there will be a costmr spicer i get it and i think that well have to look at the landscape but at some point  you know i think right now democrats made a decision during this debate that they wanted to stick by obamacare i think at some point  the president has talked about this  that this is going to collapse and lets see where this thing heads but i think right now we have a plan on the table that allows for a solution that will address all of the concerns that frankly were initially brought up as far as what the affordable care act was supposed to dokaitlanq  so if you know what the vote counts are right now and theres no discussion of pulling the healthcare bill and it gets closer to  pm and you still dont have the votes why vote mr spicer im not going to discuss our strategy i mean q  but you see what im saying rightmr spicer i doq  if you know what the votes are and you know that you dont have the votes for it to pass why votemr spicer i understand your question im just not going to comment on our strategy i think the president and the speaker are going to have a discussion about where those votes are and what some of the members needs are and well take it from thereathenaq  you talked about all the work that the president and his team have put into this  the earlymorning calls late calls the other day one of the members of congress who was here to meet with the president  congressman mchenry  called  said were bringing him to the closer you embraced that nickname from the podium whatever happens today do you still feel comfortable calling the president the closer when it comes to dealmaking on all thismr spicer look i think i said to christian and a couple others i think he has done everything possible there is no one either on capitol hill or any honest observer of whats happened that doesnt recognize the extraordinary feats but at some point as ive mentioned this isnt a oneonone negotiation this is  you know you have to get to and i dont  i think part of this question is to go to some of those nos and ask them what is the reason and what would you do and the probably is is that as ive mentioned before there is this balancing act where to get these two members youre giving up  but were doing everything possible to get to that  and that  i dont  i think when you actually objectively look at the effort that was undertaken there is no question that every single thing that has been done has been done to maximize the vote count on thisq  and to be very very clear  this has been addressed a few times but i want to get a clearer answer you talked a lot about how this is the chance this is an opportunity for republicans to make good on campaign promises i asked the president a couple days ago what happens when you keep pushing if this fails today and he said well wait and  well have to see what happens are you saying right now that there will be no future attempts to comply with that campaign promise if todays attempt failsmr spicer i cant say that therell never be  and again im not going to be fatalistic when weve got a vote at  pm i know that the president has made it clear that this is the effort this was the train thats leaving the station and that he expects everyone  you know this is our opportunity and hes got a lot left on the agenda that he wants to get done whether its immigration taxes the border wall theres so many other things that he wants to get done that were not going to sit around and figure out  this is the opportunity this is the time this is the opportunity for every member who has said that they want to repeal and replace obamacare to put their vote in the yes columnq  and last one if it does pass today  youve talked a lot about this being done in three phases today being phase one phase two and phase three one of the problems i think is that this is not information that is in scoreable form  the steps that secretary price might take and then what may end up in this final bill is there any attempt being done mr spicer well i dont know yet at some point maybe it can  i mean q  can you put the administrative steps that secretary price mr spicer i dont know thats q  is that something thats being attempted to be done because thats the kind of information i think members wantmr spicer i think right now were focused on the vote but i think that well have either omb or cbo take a look at not just the other elements but can you look at it in its totality i dont know that thats  but thats a good question that i can have the omb folks address potentially with the cbo folksthank you guys im sure well have some additional updates today thank youend pm edt

2017-03-24,Remarks by the President in TransCanada Keystone XL Pipeline Announcement  ,oval officethe president thank you very much for being here this morning today im pleased to announce the official approval of the presidential permit for the keystone xl pipeline transcanada will finally be allowed to complete this long overdue project with efficiency and with speed were working out the final details as we speak its going to be an incredible pipeline greatest technology known to man or woman and frankly were very proud of itruss girling president of transcanada is right behind me and im going to have him say a few words i know russ youve been waiting for a long long time and i hope you dont pay your consultants anything because they had nothing to do with the approval laughter you should ask for the hundreds of millions of dollars back that you paid them because they didnt do a damn thing except get a no vote right its a great day for american jobs and a historic moment for north american and energy independence this announcement is part of a new era of american energy policy that will lower costs for american families  and very significantly  reduce our dependence on foreign oil and create thousands of jobs right here in americaand i also would like to add i think its a lot safer to have pipelines than to use other forms of transportation for your productwhen completed the keystone xl pipeline will span  miles  wow  and have the capacity to deliver more than  barrels of oil per day to the gulf coast refineries thats some big pipeline the fact is that this  billion investment in american energy was delayed for so long  it demonstrates how our government has too often failed its citizens and companies over the past long period of time today we begin to make things right and to do things right today we take one more step in putting the jobs wages and economic security of american citizens first put america firstas the keystone xl pipeline now moves forward this is just the first of many energy and infrastructure projects that my administration will approve  and weve already approved a couple of other big ones very very big ones which well be announcing soon  in order to help put americans back to work grow our economy and rebuild our nationand with that id like to invite russ to say a few words russ is a very highly respected man in the energy world hes president of transcanada and i know youll do a fantastic job russ and get it up and hire plenty of american peoplethank youmr girling thank you mr president and this is a very very

going to use the best technology and be able to create thousands of jobs and important tax revenues in local communities thats something often thats overlooked in new projects like this is local communities benefit greatly from these projects it gives them tax revenues in which they can invest in schools hospitals roads teachers nurses  all of those things  build the fabric of communities and make those places better for those folks to live so again thank you very much for this opportunity and were not going to let you down sirthe president well thank you russ and i know the voters

very hard for america many of you spend weeks away from your families doing what can sometimes be a very difficult and dangerous job to put it mildly but you take care of yourselves you look out for your friends and you dont stop until the job is done thats true obamacare has inflicted great pain on american truckers many of you were forced to buy health insurance on the obamacare exchanges you experienced a crippling rise in premiums and a dramatic loss in options and you just take a look at whats happened to the costs and its incredible you look at whats going on with deductibles where theyre through the roof so essentially you dont have it because hopefully youll never have to use it because you wont have that kind of injury or sicknessso you know the problems and its put a lot of the trucking businesses out of business which is pretty tough in addition many union drivers are slated to have their plans taxed to pay obamacare and theyve been against it for a long period of time

want to dotoday the house is voting to repeal and replace the disaster known as obamacare well see what happens going to be a very close vote after we repeal and replace obamacare  and by the way its close not because obamacare is good its close  politics they know its no good everybody knows its no good its only politics because we have a great bill and i think we have a very good chance but its

borders immigration is a privilege not a right and the safety of our citizens must always come first without questionover lunch the chancellor and i will talk about our economic partnership we must work together towards fair and reciprocal trade policies that benefit both of our peoplesmillions of hardworking us citizens have been left behind by international commerce and together we can shape a future where all of our citizens have a path to financial securitythe united states will respect historic institutions and we will also recognize the right of free people to manage their own destinythe close friendship between america and germany is built on our shared value we cherish individual rights we uphold the rule of law and we seek peace among nations our alliance is a symbol of strength and cooperation to the world it is the foundation of a very very hopeful futurethank youchancellor merkel as interpreted mr president ladies and gentlemen it is a great pleasure and privilege to be here today in the white house together with president donald trump and have a first personal oneonone meeting and an exchange of viewsin the period leading up to this visit ive always said its much much better to talk to one another and not about one another and i think our conversation proved this we talked about the international situation we talked about also apprenticeship programs when we met with ceos and apprentices around a roundtable as regards the shared interests that we have let me look back into the past we the germans owe a lot to the united states of america particularly as regards the economic rise of germany this was primarily due to the help through the marshall plan we were also able to regain german unity after decades of the united states standing up for this together with other allies and standing by our side during the period of the cold war and we are very gratified to know that today we can live in peace and freedom as a unified country due to thati was gratified to know that the president had aligned how important he thinks nato is nato is of prime importance for us and it was not without very good reason that we said during our summit meeting in wales that also germany needs to increase expenditure we committed to this percent goal until  last year we increased our defense spending by  percent and were going to work together again and again on this and we said that obviously defense and security has a lot of different assets and facets to it one the one hand its supporting missions in africa for example its also promoting development assistance but its also helping mission in africa for example in trying to stand up for their own safety and security we continue to be in conversation what was important for us today was that we were able to talk about afghanistan talk about as the president quite rightly said the continuing mission of germany in afghanistan i am very glad that the united states are intending to continue to commit to the afghan mission as welltogether we fight against islamist terrorism germany is going to step up its work and is going to continue its work in afghanistan and also in syria were going to monitor the situation there very closely were going to work on political solutions in syria but also in libya  what we talked about i am very gratified to know that the american administration and also the president personally commits himself to the minsk process we need to come to a solution of this problem there has to be a safe and secure solution for ukraine but the relationship with russia has to be improved as well once the situation there on the ground is clarifiedminsk is a good basis but unfortunately we havent made yet the headway that we want to but we are going to work together with our experts in the next few months to come on this issuei am also here in my capacity as g president you know that we will be hosting the g visit  the g summit  sorry  this year and im very pleased that the president has committed to attending this summit were going to talk at some length over lunch about the issues we say trade has to be rendered fairer there has to be a winwin situation we can talk about the details of that weve already seen today when we had an exchange with our ceos and also with our apprentices what sort of potential we can tap what sort our potential our two economies have its very moving to see particularly meeting with these young people what sort of work towards the future is being done by our companies there so particularly in this period where we are transiting from traditional manufacturing to industry  capacitybuilding skills are so important incidentally not only for young people but also for those who maybe have lost their jobs and need to be reskilled in order to find a job again and that is an issue i know is very important for you here in the united states but its also important for us in germanyso i can say there are a number of issues where we will continue to cooperate very closely on the level of our experts but also on our level we had a very good first exchange of views so im very much looking forward to the talks we will have over lunchthank you president trump thank you very much well do a couple of questions mark halperinq  mr president thank you there are a lot of americans who have anxiety now like they did eight years ago as the government debates what to do about healthcare im wondering if you can tell people what your bottom lines are whats nonnegotiable youve talked in the past saying no one should be denied health insurance if they cant afford it youve talked about no cuts to medicaid and medicare are those your bottom lines and would you veto legislation that violated thoseq  chancellor merkel if i could ask you president trump has got a different style than most recent past us presidents im wondering what you think about that style if you think its good for the world or if youve got reservations about itpresident trump thank you mark we just have a really wonderful group of people meeting later we met with  pretty much nos in congress  you saw that a little while ago  and they went from all nos to all yeses and we have a lot of yeses coming in its all coming together were going to have great healthcare its going to be passed i believe i think substantially pretty quickly its coming together beautifully you have conservative groups you have other groups everybody wants certain things in the end were going to have a great healthcare plannow i have to tell you that obamacare is a disaster its failing i was in tennessee  we had a tremendous crowd the other night and they have  half of the state is uncovered the insurance companies have left and the other half has one insurance company and that will probably be bailing out pretty soon also theyll have nobody you have many states where they have one you have a lot of places now where theyll have none obamacare will fail it will fold it will close up very very soon if something isnt doneive often said politically the best thing i can do is absolutely nothing wait one year and then even the democrats will come say please please you got to help us but its not the right thing to do for the people we have a great plan we have a plan thats getting more and more popular with the republican base with the conservative base and with people generally the press has covered it very inaccurately people are truly covered well and i think its going to be something thats going to be a model to be looked uponq  may i ask whats nonnegotiable for you mr presidentpresident trump ill tell you after were finished laughter chancellor merkel as interpreted thank you very much well im here as chancellor of the federal republic of germany i represent german interests i speak with the president of the united states who stands up for as is right american interests that is our task respectively and i must say that i was very gratified to know the very warm and gracious hospitality with which i have been received herewe held a conversation where we were trying to address also those areas where we disagree but to try to bring people together try to show what is our vantage point what is the american vantage point and then try to find a compromise which is good for both sides because we need to be fair with each other each and every one is expecting for his or her leader that something good comes out of it for their own people for germany i can say well people are different people have different abilities have different traits of character have different origins have found their way into politics along different pathways all that is diversity which is good sometimes its difficult to find compromises but thats what weve been elected for if everything just went like that and without problem we wouldnt need politicians to do these jobsq   from the german press agency madam chancellor given the experience of the gdr you are always saying that you are so confident that walls can fall also how dangerous do you think this isolationist policy of the us president is what was the import of terrorists that he plans and also with the fact that he doesnt think that the eu  doesnt deal with the eu in a very respectful way and then mr president america first  dont you think that this is going to weaken also the european union and why are you so scared of diversity in the news and in the media you speak so awful of fake news and that things also cannot be proven for example the fact that you have been wiretapped by mr obamapresident trump nice friendly reporter laughter first of all i dont believe in an isolationist policy but i also believe a policy of trade should be a fair policy and the united states has been treated very very unfairly by many countries over the years and thats going to stopbut im not an isolationist im a free trader but im also a fair trader and free trade has led to a lot of bad things happening  you look at the deficits that we have and you look at all of the accumulation of debt were a very powerful company  country were a very strong very strong country well soon be at a level that we perhaps have never been before our military is going to be strengthened  its been depletedbut i am a trader i am a fair trader i am a trader that wants to see good for everybody worldwide but i am not an isolationist by any stretch of the imagination so i dont know what newspaper youre reading but i guess that would be another example of as you say fake newschancellor merkel as interpreted well allow me if i may to project in the following terms we havent yet had time to talk at great length about economic issues but i would say that the success of germany in the economic area but also on security and peace  that the success of germans have always been one where the german success is one side of the coin and the other side of the coin has been european unity and european integration thats something of which im deeply convinced and im not only saying this back home im saying this here im saying it in the united states and also here in washington in my talks with the presidentsecondly i believe that globalization ought to be shaped in an openminded way but also in a very fair way freedom of movement within the european union for example is a very important element of our economic progress of peace has been for many many decades the european countries for many many centuries waged wars against each other we have to protect our external borders because  and there we have to work on the basis of mutual interests with our neighborsmigration immigration integration has to be worked on obviously traffickers have to be stopped but this has to be done while looking at the refugees as well giving them opportunities to shape their own lives where they are help countries who right now are not in an ability to do so  sometimes because they have civil war i think thats the right way of going about it and this is obviously what we have an exchange of views about but my position is the one that i have just set out for youpresident trump i might add that we have many plants and factories coming back into the united states many jobs are coming back to michigan to ohio to pennsylvania to a lot of places where they were losing jobs and we will have a different policy but its going to be a great policy for not only the united states but a great policy worldwide and i look very much forward to itkevin cirilliq  yes mr president inaudible healthcare  what exactly does the inaudible and then for chancellor merkel what do you anticipate could be a concession you would be willing to give to the administration inaudiblepresident trump well kevin i think we have a very unified republican party after all we have the presidency we have the house we have the senate and were getting along very well i will tell you and if you were at the meeting that i just attended where we took  nos or seminos  no yeses  and within a short period of time everybody was very much on board and a commitment to vote yesi think we have a very unified party i think were actually more unified than even the election you see  when they talk about me i seem to be very popular at least this week within the party because we have our highest numbers  the highest numbers that ive ever had in the party so i think theres a great unification now healthcare is a very very difficult subject its a very complex subject and its a subject that goes both ways you do something for one side and the other side doesnt like it but its really something thats come together very well and i think its going to be very very popular  extremely popularon trade with germany i think were going to do fantastically well right now i would say that the negotiators for germany have done a far better job than the negotiators for the united states but hopefully we can even it out we dont want victory we want fairness all i want is fairness germany has done very well in its trade deals with the united states and i give them credit for it but  and i can speak to many other countries i mean you look at china you look at virtually any country that we do business with its not exactly what you call good for our workers you look at the horrible nafta transaction  nafta has been a disaster for the united states its been a disaster for companies and in particular its been a disaster for the workers a lot of the companies just moved but the workers are screwed and its probably the reason im standing here maybe number one  that and maybe the military  building up our military which we will do and we will be stronger than ever before  and hopefully not have to use it but we will be stronger and perhaps far stronger than ever before but its probably the reason im here is when you talk about tradeso i think that we are going to be a very different country i think were going to be  were going to have great values but in terms of our military its going to be much stronger and our trade deals are going to be good solid deals not deals that lead to closing plants and tremendous unemployment okay thank youchancellor merkel as interpreted when we speak about trade agreements and the european union is negotiating those agreements for all of the member states of the european union but obviously theres also input by the member states  they bring to the table whats important to themwe have underlined as a german industry german business community and have made the experience that any kind of agreement that we have concluded  for example at the very latest with south korea  brought us more jobs actually people were very much concerned about losing jobs  for example the automotive industry  but in the end it turned out  particularly as it regards south korea  in the end it turned out that both sides benefited and i think its only fair thats the purpose of concluding agreements  that both sides win and that is the sort of spirit i think in which we ought to be guided in negotiating any agreement between the united states of america and the eu i hope that we can resume the agreement that we started we have just now concluded our agreement with canada and i hope that we will come back to the table and talk about the agreement between eu and the us againq  madam chancellor a question addressed to you today were talking about trade the president in the past always said that he doesnt like multinational trade agreements but he does bilateral trade agreements do you think from the eus point of view ttip is a bilateral agreement with washington on one side the eu the other side now is the problem that america the president of the united states and the europeans have a basically different understanding of what the eu is all about thats my question addressed to youand mr president my question addressed to you if i may  rejected white house claims is that the alleged wiretapping on you on the trump tower on trump organization or on members of your campaign was  that british intelligence was either responsible for it or involved in it after these claims are rejected what is your take on that are there other suspects or do you think it was a mistake to blame british intelligence for this and by the way my second question are there from time to time tweets that you regret in hindsight president trump very seldomq  very seldom so you never would have wished not to have president trump very seldom probably wouldnt be here right now  but very seldom we have a tremendous group of people that listen and i can get around the media when the media doesnt tell the truth so i like thatas far as wiretapping i guess by this past administration at least we have something in common perhaps laughter and just to finish your question we said nothing all we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television i didnt make an opinion on it that was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on fox and so you shouldnt be talking to me you should be talking to fox okayq  thank youchancellor merkel as interpreted well i believe that the president has clearly set out his philosophy as to what trade agreements have to bring about for the american side as well i personally dont think that germany needs to negotiate and not the european union weve devolved our competences to the european union so the european union or rather the commission negotiates on behalf of the member states so thats not going to prevent us from concluding agreements indeed this would be then qualify as a bilateral agreement between the eu and the united states if we had it but the question is will it be of benefit to both countries or not and let me be very honest very candid  a free trade agreement with the united states of america has not always been all that popular in germany either there have been less demonstrations against this free trade agreements in the united states that in europe and also in germany so i am very glad to note that apparently the perspective on that has changed a little bit at least in germany toopresident trump thank you very much great honor thank you thank youend pm edt

2017-03-17,Remarks by President Trump in Roundtable Discussion on Vocational Training with U.S. and German Business Leaders  ,cabinet room pm edtpresident trump chancellor thank you very much such a great honor to get to know you to be with you i want to thank all of the business leaders who have joined us to discuss a subject thats very important to me  training our workforce for the st century especially with respect to manufacturing jobswere working every day to bring back jobs to our country and thousands and thousands are already coming back youre seeing it youre reading about it in the papers every single day we want to make sure that we have the workforce development programs we need to ensure these jobs are being filled by american workersgermany and the united states have incredible opportunity to deepen our partnership as we continue to develop a strong workforce in both of our countries both germany and the united states are pioneering jobtraining programs here in the united states companies have created revolutionary hightech and online courses and of course for decades germany has been a model for highly successful apprenticeship  thats a name i like apprentice  apprenticeship programs as a result germanys youth unemployment rate is much lower than many of the other countries especially the eu countriesi welcome collaboration between our two countries and our industry leaders we have some of our great industry leaders here as you know chancellor great people we must embrace new and effective jobtraining approaches including online courses high school curriculums and privatesector investment that prepare people for trade manufacturing technology and other really wellpaying jobs and careers these kinds of options can be a positive alternative to a fouryear degree so many people go to college four years they dont like it theyre not necessarily good at it but theyre good at other things like fixing engines and building things i see it all the time and ive seen it  when i went to school i saw it i sat next to people that werent necessarily good students but they could take an engine apart blindfoldedcompanies across the country have a chance to develop vocational training programs that will meet their growing needs and to help us achieve greater prosperity the german apprenticeship model is one of the proven programs to developing a highly skilled workforce germany has been amazing at this and im glad that the leaders of so many companies represented today have recently launched successful programs right here in the united states and we need that because were training people as the jobs are pouring back in  and they are coming back in big league i believe that both countries will be stronger if we continue to deepen our bilateral cooperation on vocational training as we build off the best ideas create the greatest opportunity for growth and improve the lives of so many workersi want to thank everybody in the room i want to thank my daughter ivanka whos with us today and mostly  and most of all i want to thank  chancellor i want to thank you very much its a great honor to have you in the white house its a great honor to have you in the united states and i look forward to spending time with youthank youchancellor merkel speaks germanpresident trump maybe before the press leaves id like to ask some of the folks around  the great leaders of industry and business to introduce themselves say a couple of words and then well get onto a little bit more private meeting okayginnims rometty okay im ginni rometty with ibm and were going to talk about two programs one is a certification program which mr president today were going to announce  veterans that were certifying in cybersecurity to be employed and then the second is something called ptech a publicprivate partnership think of it as a sixyear high school but the graduates come out with an associate degree and with a curriculum that business will hire and we will have  schools by the end of the year and youll meet one of our recent graduates in a second janiel richards will introduce herself and tell you about herself  trained at the intersection of business and technology president trump great job participant weve found that a lot of the privatesector companies have done a great job trying to train the workforce for the jobs that they need the jobs of the future in a lot of cases in america were finding that we dont have enough qualified applicants for the jobs that we have available so in working with the private sector  and ginni has been a great leader of that  the white house has been trying to get behind a lot of these programs that can help make sure were training the american people for the jobs that were hopefully going to be producing in the future secretary ross our hope is that today we really come with a way forward some specific programs where we can interact between the educational community the business community and the government because this is a monumental problem that needs a monumental solution ms richards thank you for the introduction good afternoon all thank you for the opportunity to share my story it is both an honor and a pleasure to be here today as mentioned my name is janiel richards in am  years old and i am from inaudible enrolling in ibms ptech school was the best decision for me personally and professionally i did not fully realize the weight of the opportunity i was given however looking back it was a life chanceptech strengthened my confidence and provided me with mentors who helped me strive i learned the importance of understanding computers and gained new skills in both coding and programming i graduated the program in four and a half years  relatively early  and i graduated with my high school diploma and associates degree in computer science as well as internship experience at ibmi learned that technology is omnipresent and opens endless doors i am now a digital commerce design developer at ibm where i use my skills to create website pages and checkout pages for the marketplace im also pursuing my bachelors degree at early college without the support of ptech and ibm i would not be where i am today i believe that every student should be offered this chance thank you allpresident trump thats a great job thank you very much great job wow who

apprenticeship program there which  mr president the two things i want to talk about today is in fact apprenticeship and  theres a book here that i can show which has dow and siemens name on it and just to let you know that we are working already together as two collaborators across the atlantic to actually scale up programs like the one that was mentioned by the young lady to my right so i want to talk about that and how we can scale it up through this great leadership that youre showing and i also want to talk about veterans and displaced workers especially in places like michigan where we are based we have community college work called fast start which is taking displaced workers and reskilling them when new tech meets industrial tech as madame chancellor says opportunity is there but weve got to create it by scaling right so i want to also talk about thatand my last comment is a big thank you for lending us or giving us ivanka and jared theyve been a tremendous duo in making this

2017-03-17,Remarks by President Trump and Veterans Affairs Secretary Shulkin at Veterans Affairs Listening Session  ,roosevelt room am edtthe president a special group of people very special to me very important and i want to thank you all for being here and for your work on behalf of our nations veterans our great great people our veteranswere all united by a very common mission we will protect those who protect us ive been saying that a lot over the last two years at rallies and speeches we will protect those who protect us and thats just starting because i think the veterans have not been treated fairly and david and a group of brilliant brilliant doctors and businessmen are forming a board and youve got the most talented people that ive ever seen working with you this is  no more games going to be played at the va and i want to thank david your secretary  your new secretary whos going to be so outstanding i think he actually passed  to nothing when i heard that vote i said where did that come from a hundred to nothing right passed  to nothing  for bringing your vision experience and determination to the crucial task of reforming the va and ensuring care for our returning heroes and warriors and tonight im having a major meeting with some of the people that we put on a board ike perlmutter is an amazing man  marvel  is one of the great great businessmen of our time and others  were having a meeting tonight at what we call affectionately the southern white house seems to be the most convenient location everybody always wants to go to the southern white house so are you going to be at that meeting you heard about it right its going to be great  all about the va the vas mission statement is engraved in the plaques outside its headquarters it reads to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan and that was stated by abraham lincoln that was lincolns pledge  called lincolns pledge but for too many veterans this hasnt been their experience at all weve been reading horrible stories over the years and already david im hearing its getting much better a lot of improvements are being made and its going to change and under my administration it will change  very important to meduring my campaign i outlined a detailed plan to reforming veterans care throughout the country and were working to put that plan into effect and its moving i think i can honestly ahead of scheduleas commanderinchief i will not accept substandard service for our great veterans every member of our government is expected to do their utmost to ensure our veterans have the care that theyre so entitled to  maybe more entitled to than anybody and that hasnt been the way they were treated but it is the way theyre going to be treatedso again i want to thank you all for being here its a great honor and maybe ill ask david just to say a few wordssecretary shulkin sure thank you mr presidentthe president thank yousecretary shulkin mr vice president i wanted to let you know the people in this room are some of the most dedicated passionate people advocating for our veterans and they are our partners in this quest to transform va and we really are so grateful that theyre here with us standing as partners i also want to thank you mr president for the budget i think that youve honored your commitment to showing that this country cares about the veterans and youve given us the ability to make sure that we are able to care for them i also wanted to tell you that yesterday the house passed an accountability bill and were very very grateful for chairman roes leadership and for the houses leadership in doing that were looking forward to the senate bringing a bill forwardand so i think as you said were committed to the plan that you outlined during your campaign to making the va the type of organization that americans want it to be and were well on our way to do that so thank you very muchthe president well thats great and unrelated we just had a meeting with probably  congressmen and it was an amazing meeting because they were all nos would you say mike they were all nos or pretty much no and after  minutes  now in all fairness not  minutes it was really actually about four or five days but after  minutes they went from no to all yeses so the healthcare looks like its going to be in great shape its a great plan the press doesnt give it a fair read but ive heard that before what are you going to do  the fake newsbut its a great plan or i wouldnt be involved with it i wouldnt be involved so you have  nos and we have rejiggered it and weve done some great things but the nos in every single case went to a yes so that was a great honor and healthcare looks like its really happening and its going to great obamacare is dead some of you folks have yourself  you have family members that have suffered greatly under obamacare its dying its just about on its last legs if we did nothing if we did absolutely nothing obamacare is dead it will fail in tennessee where i just left half of the state has no insurance and no carrier its gone and theyre going to leave the other half of the state very soon you have that in many cases many states are down to one and theyll end up with nothingso obamacare is dead were going to come up with a replacement thats going to be fantastic we have no support from the democrats thats why its a little  we have to go interesting little routes instead of just approving it it has to be approved in pieces and thats working out really well but we just got  very very great people that went from no or maybe  but maybe leaning to no  right mike and they all have given me a commitment that theyre voting for our healthcare plan so that was greati want to thank you all

that  i did yesterday via twitter  that the lottery for the th annual white house easter egg roll is open until saturday  this coming saturday everyone who is interested in attending can go to recreationgov further information is at whitehousegov for detailsat his rally last night the president addressed the decision by the federal district court in hawaii to block his lawful executive order as the president said last night the law and the constitution give the president the power to suspend immigration when he deems it to be necessary in the national interest the court didnt even bother to quote the relevant statute in its opinion which could have plainly shown that the president clearly has this authorityi know youve heard it before but since the court didnt let me quote it again for you  us code  states whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the united states would be detrimental to the interests of the united states he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriatethe department of justice said in a statement that they strongly disagrees with the federal district courts ruling which is flawed both in reasoning and in scope doj continued the presidents executive order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nations security and the department will continue to defend this executive order in the courtsthe department is exploring all available options to vigorously defend this executive order we intend to appeal the flawed rulings currently the department of justice is determining the legal strategy and timing we expect action to be taken soon to appeal the ruling in the th circuit and to seek clarification of the order prior to appeal in the th circuitthe danger is real and the law is clear the president was elected to change our broken immigration system and he will continue to exercise his constitutional authority and presidential responsibility to protect our nationand just before i get to your questions and then before well introduce director mulvaney i just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions that have come up recentlyjon decker asked multiple times on the enforcement of the presidents executive order to restrict lobbying activities of executive branch employees which includes a fiveyear ban on lobbying agencies where youve served and a lifetime ban on lobbying from foreign governments i said id get back to jon so here we go the executive order itself has a section section  which focuses on enforcement the order outlines that each agency head is tasked with working with the office of government ethics to establish procedures for determining potential violations of the ethics pledge should a violation be determined the executive order authorizes the department of justice to enforce the order through several mechanisms debarment proceedings  these would restrict an individual or his or her associated entities from doing business with the federal government seeking an injunction such as a restraining order from lobbying for  years  the five years in the ethics agreement plus an additional five years or civil penalties such as a fine commensurate with the nature of the violationthe president fully expects the department of justice to vigorously enforce this executive orderalso yesterday several of you asked where the house is in regard to additional legislation as outlined in the third prong of the ahca and the presidents plan to reform healthcare im pleased to note that last night leader mccarthy in the house introduced four pieces of legislation that will remove burdensome regulations lower costs and increase access as weve noted the competitive health insurance reform act hr  which eliminates antitrust protection for an insurance provider creating competition so that americans are not left with just one choice for healthcare coverage the small business health fairness act hr  which allows small businesses to band together and negotiate lower prices the protecting access to care act hr  which limits frivolous lawsuits that unnecessarily drive up healthcare costs and the selfinsurance protection act hr  which protects workers who get their healthcare coverage from employers that selfinsure by providing a backstop on catastrophic losses and finally in terms of following up from yesterday in regard to the dojs indictments of russian hackers on yahoo data this action demonstrates the united states commitment to identifying cyber criminals and bringing them to justice no matter where they are it also highlights the criminal importance of international cooperation to our cyber regime and like i said yesterday though this is a lawful enforcement action anything beyond that i would direct you to the department of justice and the fbi for further detailsbefore i continue let me turn it over to director mulvaney to talk a little bit about the budgetdirectordirector mulvaney thanks very much good afternoon and happy day before st patricks day also known as budget day most of you heard me talk about the budget before so im not going to say too many things in opening before we get to your questions but we will remind you that this is what were calling the america first budget we had an america first candidate you now have an america first president and it shouldnt surprise anybody that we have an america first budget its in the details as we talked about last week   billion of additional defense spending we have some more details today on where that money is goingwere seeing increases at the va increases within the department of justice for law enforcement increases within the department of homeland security for things that include border security and immigration controls immigration is within  excuse me  increases within the department of energy to deal with a nuclear triadand then corresponding reductions in similar amounts offsetting dollar for dollar in other programs the largest reduction if youve seen the budget already is a  percent reduction within the environmental protection agency the next largest reduction on a percentage basis is within department of state and the other departments are reduced in lesser amounts i think the smallest reduction we have is nasa which is just less than  percent but there again as with many of the agencies youll see certain line items within those budgets plussed upthis is the message the president wanted to send to the public to the press to capitol hill he wants more money for defense more money for border enforcement more money for law enforcement generally more money for the vets more money for school choice and then to offset that money with savings elsewhere so that all of that is done without an additional dollar added to the deficitas ive mentioned before the budget does not balance the budget this budget simply reallocates and reprioritizes spending as any family or business would dothis budget does not  for those of you who were not here last week  this budget does not address the bigpicture items such as policy changes revenue flows tax policy mandatory spending this is simply the topline spending budget thats why we call it the budget blueprint and not the full budget that full budget which will contain all the rest of those pieces and parts will be released in maybefore i take questions im going to do something i dont ordinarily do  im sure its kind of new  im going to call on the new york times because theyre in trouble apparently is there a  wheres my new york times guy matt flegenheimer and alan rappeport  okay are in big trouble ill give you the first question but you have to deliver this message to them they printed this morning that i am the father of yearold triplet girls my yearold daughter really wishes that were happy  really wishes that had happened but my two yearold sons are upset laughter so if you could clarify that that would be great and ill give you the first questions if youve got one so go aheadq  were not great at math obviously at the new york times director mulvaney the math is right its actually the gender that was wrong laughter q  sir during the campaign president trump then candidate trump talked about the national debt which of course has reached around  trillion you mentioned it in your budget message this morning is there a plan as the president talked about during last years campaign to actually eliminate the national debt in eight years he said during the campaign it would be easy to actually eliminate the entire debt  not the deficit but the debt  in eight years is that something that this president is actually committed to trying to dodirector mulvaney its a good question its a fair question i would just suggest to you its not the right time for the question the budget blueprint again does not deal with the debt it even doesnt deal with the deficit it is simply the first part of the appropriations process well send this up to the hill now and the appropriations committees of the house and the senate  of course the house controls the power of the purse the senate  excuse me congress controls the power of the purse and this will be the first step in that processwe will start to address the issues of the longerterm deficit longerterm debt in that larger budget and of course well have to deal at that time with things like mandatory spending tax policy revenue flows to the government so again its a fair question i just dont think now is the time to ask the question q  the  percent that comes out of the state department i know that youre leaving a lot of discretion to the people who are in charge there at all of these agencies for how to implement these cuts but how much is intended to come out of the foreign aid budget of that  billiondirector mulvaney a lot of it as ive said before one of the reasons that youre seeing such a dramatic reduction in the state department on a percentage basis is not that this president thinks that diplomacy is not important  in fact nothing could be further from the truth weve already seen that secretary tillerson has had a tremendous  one diplomatic success already on the deal he cut with iraqthe president believes in diplomacy and we believe that this budget protects that core function of the state department it just so happens that much of the foreign aid that the president talked about in campaign  much of the money that goes to climate research green energy those types of things  are actually in the state department budget if those line items had been in the department of commerce you would see department of commerce having gone down by a similarly large percentageso the answer to your question is that most of the cuts within the state department try to focus directly on foreign aid yes sirq  yes the budget showed a  decrease for nasa but youve also talked about in the administration using private companies such as spacex for example for more of that so does this show some  is some of this going to be shifted over to the private sector and does this show a commitment on the administrations part towards science and nasadirector mulvaney it does again if you go back and you do what we did which is go back to the presidents speeches the interviews he gave and just talking to him we tried to identify his priorities and one of the things he told us was look im still interested in america being involved in space explorationso even though the overall topline number at nasa is reduced by a small fraction  i think its  percent as you mentioned  individual line items that deal with specifically space exploration are actually plussed up and part of the intent there is to promote exactly what you just talked aboutyes sirq  two questions your own experience in the house tells you that a lot of these cuts havent been voted for before do you consider this budget an opening bid and do you expect a lot of pushback even from republicans on the specificity and the size of these cuts and secondly to take your point about the presidents words on the campaign those of us who traveled around with him remember  he said he didnt want to touch social security medicare the big entitlements the fact that thats not in this budget is that a signal that those programs are going to remain untouched and as the committee for a responsible federal budget said that ignores  percent of spending and  percent of its growth over the next decadedirector mulvaney ill deal with the second one first which is the president is absolutely going to keep the promises he kept on the campaign trail again you will see no reference in social security here no reference to medicare here no reference to medicaid here or any of the other mandatory programs  what some people call entitlement programs  because thats not what this budget isthis is the discretionary part of the budget half of which as you know is defense and the other half is everything else the alphabet soup of government so just because its not here doesnt mean were dodging the issue you would never see in any budget blueprint that deals with the topline spending numbers social security medicare and medicaidto your other question about it not being popular on the hill  yeah i can recognize that ive been on the hill enough to know that some of these would be very unpopular keep in mind the president is in a unique position ive been a member of congress i represented  people in south carolina i had my constituency it was a district senators represent an entire state were always dealing with special interests from back home were dealing with lobbyists from back homethe president is beholden to none of that the president has drafted a budget for the entire nation because thats who he sees himself as representing he did not ask lobbyists for input on this he did not ask special interests for input on this and he certainly didnt focus on how these programs might impact a specific congressional districtbut we knew that going into it and again the message were sending to the hill is we want more money for the things the president talked about defense being the top one national security and we dont want to add to the budget deficit if congress has another way to do that were happy to talk to them about ityes sir in the glassesq  james bays from al jazeera the united nations said the world is currently facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the end of world war ii   million people in just four countries facing starvation or famine and yet youre cutting funding to the un cutting funding to the foreign aid budget are you worried that some of the most vulnerable people on earth will suffer as a resultdirector mulvaney were absolutely reducing funding to the un and to the various foreign aid programs including those run by the un and other agencies that should come as a surprise to no one who watched the campaign the president said specifically hundreds of time  you covered him  im going to spend less money on people overseas and more money on people back home and thats exactly what were doing with this budgetyes maamq  given your focus on dollarfordollar offsets in fiscal  and for your fiscal  request you didnt insist on dollarfordollar offsets why is that why are you not concerned about adding to the deficit in fiscal director mulvaney the large part of the  the point  the question deals with the  request which is a  billion  i think its actually  billion  a billion and a half in there for the wall and its not entirely offset theres a couple reasons for that one of them is time another one is that some of that is what they call overseas contingency operations now you also know that i have a somewhat colored history with the overseas contingency operation but i will tell you that we went through this and made sure that the money thats being requested is true oco  means that its focused truly on the areas where were involved overseas iraq syria afghanistan those types of placesso we have sent them  billion worth of proposed reductions for  but not all of them are offsetyes maamq  the president has called for eliminating funding for the corporation for public broadcast and the national endowment for the arts if the republican congress sent the president appropriate bills that fund cpb and nea will he veto those bills and tell the republican leadership to send bill that defunds those thingsdirector mulvaney the message the president sent right now is that we want to defund those and theres completely defensible reasons for doing that its a simple message by the way i put myself in the shoes of that steelworker in ohio the coalmining family in west virginia the mother of two in detroit and im saying okay i have to go ask these folks for money and i have to tell them where im going to spend it can i really go to those folks look them in the eye and say look i want to take money from you and i want to give it to the corporation of public broadcasting that is a really hard sell in fact some of you dont think we can defend anymoreas to specific vetoes you and i both know it doesnt come over one by one line item by line item doesnt come over they come over in large appropriations bills and well work with congress to go through the appropriations process and well make determinations on whether or not to sign appropriations bills or veto them at the appropriate timeyes sirq  there are several cases in the country where youre talking about eliminating some of these unauthorized programs are you laying down a marker there on unauthorized programs and do you think spending discipline would be improved if congress authorized everything that it is director mulvaney we hope so for those of you who arent familiar with this we actually spend a lot of money in the federal government thats on programs that arent authorized at all remember spending is sort  to break it down its sort of a threestep process to spend money you have to budget for it first then you have to authorize it and then you have to appropriate it but a lot of the programs that weve spent money on for years have been unauthorized spending either they used to be authorized  actually most of them used to be authorized and then they simply lapsed and some of them were just never authorized in the first place they simply were appropriated without any authorizationand yeah the message is thats not the right way to do it in fact we think thats the wrong way to do it you heard the president talk specifically on the campaign trail about at least  percent reductions for unauthorized programs and thats what generated this budgetq  director mulvaney talked about this budget basically keeping the promises that the president made during the course of the campaign for housing and urban development this budget blueprint calls for a percent reduction  billion during the course of the campaign president trump said specifically to urban black voters he says what do you have to lose it turns out what they have to lose is at least  billion that goes to many programs that benefit those communities what do you say to those americans who feel thatdirector mulvaney nobody is going to get kicked out of their houses what we did when we looked at the hud budget was try to figure out a way to spend money better and what we saw  and i talked to dr carson about this just today  what we saw as we went through the analysis of the hud budget is that a lot of their money got spent on government housing and building its actually infrastructure and what senator carson  what secretary carson and i talked about was figure out a way to do that better and as we did that what we realized was we are working on a large infrastructure program that we hope to roll out this summer and what secretary carson wants to do is take the money for the infrastructure thats in hud right now  and not very well run  and move that into this larger programin fact youll see the same line items  or similar line items at the department of transportation for the same reason these do not mean the president is changing his commitment to infrastructure again far from it what were saying is look for years and years we have built infrastructure like this and it doesnt work very well q  well director mulvaney let me finish and ill get back to you so what were doing now is were taking it out of the discretionary budget and were going to move it into the larger infrastructure plan this summerq  housing and urban development and the community development block grants arent exclusively about housing they support a variety of different programs including in part meals on wheels that affects a lot of americans in austin texas today one organization there that delivers those meals to thousands of elderly says that those citizens will no longer be able to be provided those meals so what do you say to those americans who are ultimately losing out not on housing but on other things that are taken out of that budgetdirector mulvaney as you know or i think you know that meals on wheels is not a federal program its part of that community  the cdbg  the block grants that we give to the states and then many states make the decision to use that money on meals on wheelsheres what i can tell you about cdbgs because thats what we fund  right  is that we spend  billion on those programs since the s the cdbgs have been identified as programs since i believe the first  actually the second bush administration as ones that were just not showing any results we cant do that anymore we cant spend money on programs just because they sound good and meals on wheels sounds great  again thats a state decision to fund that particular portion to but to take the federal money and give it to the states and say look we want to give you money for programs that dont work  i cant defend that anymore we cannot defend that anymore were  trillion in debtwere going to spend money were going to spend a lot of money but were not going to spend it on programs that cannot show that they actually deliver the promises that weve made to peopleq  so youre talking about programs that do work or dont work theres a program called the shine and its in pennsylvania  rural counties of pennsylvania that provides afterschool educational programs for individuals in those areas which so happens to be the state that helped propel president trump to the white house im curious to what you say to those americans in the community where they tell me today that  individuals will no longer  children who need it most  will no longer be provided in those mostneeded communities that educational care they needdirector mulvaney im not familiar  you all are at an advantage over me because id have to memorize all  line items so lets talk about afterschool programs generally theyre supposed to be educational programs right thats what theyre supposed to do theyre supposed to help kids who dont get fed at home get fed so they do better in school guess what theres no demonstrable evidence theyre actually doing that theres no demonstrable evidence of actually helping results helping kids do better in school which is what  when we took your money from you to say look were going to go spend it on an afterschool program the way we justified it was these programs are going to help these kids do better in school and get better jobs and we cant q  to be clear were saying that director mulvaney  prove that thats happeningq  to be clear were saying  the administration with this budget is saying that no afterschool programs out there are doing their job in helping educate these childrendirector mulvaney no but i  and again now youre asking me a question i dont know the answer to but i dont believe we cut all the funding for those types of things yes sirq  just to follow up on that you were talking about the steelworker in ohio and the coalminer in pennsylvania and so on but those workers may have an elderly mother who depends on the meals on wheels program who may have kids in head start and yesterday or the day before you described this as a hardpower budget but is it also a hardhearted measuredirector mulvaney no i dont think so in fact i think its probably one of the most compassionate things we can do to actually be q  cut programs that help the elderly and kidsdirector mulvaney youre only focusing on half of the equation right youre focusing on recipients of the money were trying to focus on both the recipients of the money and the folks who give us the money in the first place and i think its fairly compassionate to go to them and say look were not going to ask you for your hardearned money anymore a single mom of two in detroit okay  give us your money  were not going to do that anymore unless we can guarantee q  and that single mom has two kids  what if that single mom has two kids in head startdirector mulvaney let me finish unless we can guarantee to you that that money is actually being used in a proper function and i think that is about as compassionate as you can get yes maamq  i have a question on the border walldirector mulvaney sureq  thank you for doing this the budget as i understand it asked for  billion so  billion for this year and  billion for the following year theres no mention at all of whether or not mexico is going to help pay for it or reimburse the us for it as the president pledged so where is that money coming from for the border walldirector mulvaney a couple of things your number is correct  its  billion for   back to your question about   and i think  billion for  people have asked me a couple times does that build the whole wall no it doesnt but it gets us a start on the program and youll see some of the wall being built this year and then obviously increased funding in  but the wall will take longer than two years to build as to the source of funds thats up to the president and the treasury and the state department im the folks  were the guys at omb and the gals at omb who take the money that we have and allocate it in a budgetary process so its up to somebody else to figure out where the money comes fromyes sirq  yes the budget for doj zeroes out reimbursements for state and local jails holding immigrants in the country illegally some of that money now goes to sanctuary cities is that part of the presidents promise to withhold funding from sanctuary cities and are there other elements of the budget intended to carry out that punishment that the president talked aboutdirector mulvaney honestly im not familiar with that particular line item so let me deal with the doj like this  and also homeland because theres many pieces in homeland that deal with this sort of topic youre going to see an increase in homeland for an increase in detention facilities its a fairly significant increase in detention facilities because we have  the president has said he wants to stop the catchandrelease program in fact he signed an executive order to do just that and we fund that we increase the amount of money for detention facilities for folks who come into the country illegally ill give you a followup because i didnt answer your first question very wellq  a question about the cuts youre making to things like transportation and housing you said those would be paid for later with other appropriations but you said this would be balanced and i know youve been a fiscal hawk yourself it sounds like a bit of a shell game though where youre saying now this is a balanced budget but youre saying youre not stopping to pay for other things because those will be paid for later but then where are you going to pay for those other things eventually doesnt all this stuff have to get paid fordirector mulvaney and just to clarify its not a balanced budget there will still be roughly a  billion deficit according to the congressional budget office next year we simply didnt add to that in order to spend more money on the presidents priorities regarding moving projects out of the say the base budgets for the agencies and into the infrastructure the infrastructure program is something weve just recently started it wont probably come until summer or maybe even early fall we have to do obamacare repeal and replace first then tax reform second that leaves infrastructure probably third which may come after the august recess in congress so youre making an assumption that im not willing to make youre making an assumption that all that infrastructure that we provide for later on in the year is going to go to the deficit and im not willing to make that assumptionyes sirq  i have two short questions one the budget blueprint provides robust funding for embassy security director mulvaney yes sirq   citing the benghazi accountability review board does that mean there will be an increase considering all the criticism that the president and republicans levied against president obama for supposedly cutting embassy securitydirector mulvaney thats one of those line items that we leave up to secretary tillerson he and i talked about the state department budget and how he decides to allocate that it may be that there are some embassies that dont need a lot more security and some that do so we give him the flexibility to do thatthe gentleman in the back had a questionq  many countries around the world didnt take seriously president trump that he would cut the foreign aid because most of the countries getting us aid were not with the us supporting terrorism against the us and also they were not working with the us so how does president trump feel now about those countries will they continue the aid because us taxpayers will be asking that we dont have to spend on those countries who are against the usdirector mulvaney again i come back to what the president said on the campaign which is that hes going to spend less money overseasto your question though  because this came up the other day  which is the hard power versus soft power there is a very deliberate attempt here to send a message to our allies and our friends such as india and our adversaries with other countries shall we say which is that this is hardpower budget that this administration tends to change course from a softpower budget to a hardpower budget and thats a message that our adversaries and our allies alike should takeill take one more because im sort of running down yes maamq  can you explain a little bit more about what message the president is trying to send by eliminating a lot of funding for science and climate change research as you mentioned earlier and just a followup later when you get a chancedirector mulvaney sure a couple different messages when we talked about science and climate change lets deal with them separately on science were going to function  were going to focus on the core function theres reductions for example i think in the nih  the national institutes of health why because we think theres been mission creep we think they do things that are outside their core functions we think theres tremendous opportunity for savings we recommend for example that a couple of facilities be combined there would be cost savings from that again this comes back to the presidents business person view of government which is if you took over this as a ceo and youd look at this on a spreadsheet and go why do we have all of these facilities  why do we have seven when we can do the same job with three wont that save money and the answer is yes so part of your answer is focusing on efficiencies and focusing on doing what we do betterregarding the question as to climate change i think the president was fairly straightforward  were not spending money on that anymore we consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that so that is a specific tie to his campaignq  a followup director mulvaney yes im sorry you had a followupq  just really quick on meals on wheels you mentioned that its one of those programs thats determined had not been doing its job effectively what evidence are you using to make that statement and is not feeding seniors in and of itself the fulfillment of the director mulvaney and my understanding from having been in the state government  and i may have this wrong ive been wrong several times today  this may not be the first time but my understanding of meals on wheels is that that is a state determination the federal government doesnt directly fund that it funds the central community development block grants the cdbgs and some states choose to take the money and do meals and wheels other states and localities might choose to do something else with them we look at the cdbgs and when we do that we look at this as  billion spent over  years without the appreciable benefits to show for that type of taxpayer expenditure and thats why we have the reductionq  may i follow up on thatdirector mulvaney no because im going to  how sean does this every day for an hour and a half i have no idea laughter but im going to mr spicer no keep going laughter director mulvaney yeah exactly laughter ive been up since  am this morning so im going to turn it back over to sean thank you very much and well talk to you all soonmr spicer thanks guys anyway so to kick it off jonathan karlq  so sean the day before yesterday you said you were extremely confident that the house and senate intelligence committees would ultimately vindicate the presidents allegation that trump tower was wiretapped as im sure you have now seen the senate intelligence committee has said they see no indications trump tower was the subject of surveillance that seems to be a pretty blanket statement whats your reactionmr spicer well i think theres several things its interesting to me that just as a point of interest that when one entity says one thing that proves  that claims one things you guys cover it ad nauseam when devin nunes came out and said i think its very possible  yesterday  it was crickets from you guys when devin nunes came out and said there was no connection that he saw to russia  crickets when tom cotton said the same you dont want to cover the stuff q  devin nunes said he saw no evidence of wiretapping at trump towermr spicer no no hold on  actually q  now youve had the house intelligence committee and the senate intelligence committee mr spicer no no actually heres his quote jonathan no heres the direct quote i think its very possiblethats what he said when he said the presidents communications could have been swept up in collectionso again q  he said there was no  i saw no indication of wiretapping  no evidence of wiretappingmr spicer i understand that and i think the president has been very clear when he talked about this  and he talked about it last night  when he talked about wiretapping he meant surveillance and that there have been incidents that have occurred devin nunes couldnt have stated it more beautifully but you choose not to cover that part you chose not to cover when tom cotton went out when richard burr went out when others  chairmen nunes and others  and said that there was no  hold on q  well the senate intelligence committee is saying point blank  they say no evidence of surveillance  mr spicer i understand that jonathan and where was your passion and where was your concern when they all said that there was no connection to russia where was it then crickets from you guys because at the end of the day when q  so youre saying the president stands by his allegation that president obama wiretapped the trump towermr spicer no no no hold on hold on im making a point the point is this number one that its interesting how when evidence comes out and people who have been briefed on the russia connection come out and say that there was nothing that they have seen that proves a connection you choose not to cover that you dont stop the narrative you continue to perpetuate a false narrativewhen he came out yesterday and said i see no evidence that this happened when he said i think its very possible but like i said we should know later you dont cover that part you only cover the parts that  but lets go through what we do know okay q  i want you to respond to the senate intelligence committee mr spicer hold on hold on let me  and i am trying to answer your question jonathan if you can calm downif you look at what the new york times reported on january th  they said in its final days the obama administration has expanded the power of the national security agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the governments  other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections the new rules significantly relax longstanding limits on what the nsa may do with the information gathered by its most powerful surveillance operation which are largely unregulated by wiretapping lawswhen sara carter reported that by the start of the new year it brought with it unexpected politicizing of the intelligence gathered in secret separately the obama administration amended a longstanding executive order allowing information intercepted through fisa warrants or by the national security agency to be shared by a wider audience and  government agencies as obama was leave office intelligence normally reserved for just a handful of intelligence leaders was spread throughout briefings to scores of workers and soon leaks began appearing in news media office organizations often in stories lacking context of how national security investigations are actually concludedon march rd fox news chief anchor bret baier said that the following there was a report in june   a fisa request by the obama administration  foreign intelligence surveillance court  to monitor communications involving donald trump and several other campaign officials then they got turned down then in october then they renewed it and did a startup wiretap at trump tower with some computer and russian banks baier continues a june fisa request that foreign intelligence surveillance courts gets shot down a judge says  hold  jonathan im going to  you can ask  you can follow up  a judge says nogo to monitoring trump tower they go back in october they do get a fisa granted this is wiretap going on and a monitoring of computers that have some ties they believe to russian accounts by all accounts they dont come up with anything in the investigation but the investigation continues and we dont know iton november th  days after the election heat street reported two separate sources with links to the counterintelligence community had confirmed to heat street that the fbi sought and was granted a fisa warrant in october giving countersurveillance intelligence permission to examine the activities of us persons in donald trumps campaign with ties to russia the first request which sources say named trump was denied back in june but the second was drawn more narrowly and granted in october after evidence was presented of a server possibly related to the trump campaign and its alleged links to two banks  svb bank and russias alfabank sources suggest that a fisa warrant was granted to look at the full context of related documents that concern us persons two separate sources with links to the counterintelligence community have confirmed that the fbi sought and was granted a fisa warrant in october giving counterintelligence permission to examine the activity of us persons in donald trumps campaign with ties to russiathey go on the fisa warrant was granted in connection with investigation of suspected activities between the server and two banks however it is thought that the intelligence community that the warrant covers any us person connected to this un investigation and thus covers donald trump and at least three further men who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as media surrogateson january th the new york times reported the following american law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communication and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation of possible links between russian officials and associates of presidentelect donald j trump one official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications have been provided to the white house it is unclear which russian officials under investigation or what particular conversations caught the attention of american eavesdroppers the legal standard for opening these investigations is lowandy mccarthy writing in national review suggested from three reports from the guardian heat street and the new york times it appears the fbi has concerns about a private server in trump tower that was connected to one or two russian banks heat street describes these concerns as centering on possible financial and banking offenses this is his quote  i italicized the word offenses because it denotes crimes ordinarily when crimes are suspected there is a criminal investigation not a national security investigationwe go on sara carter from circa reporting intelligence professionals tell circa news they were concerned that some of the russian intelligence was spread through group briefings to a muchlargerthanusual audience back in january this would have happened during the final days of the obama administration when it expanded executive order  which allows employees with a need to know have further unfettered access to raw data stowed by the nsa the new rules allowed the nsa to share raw signals intelligence information including the names of those involved in phone conversations and emails the expansion of the order makes it difficult to narrow in on the leaks and frankly it allows too many people access to the raw data which only used to be available to a select few said a us official who spoke on the condition of anonymity and was not granted to speak on the authority numerous outlets including the new york times have reported on the fbi investigation into mr trumps advisors bbc and then mcclatchy revealed the existence of a multiagency working group to coordinate investigations across the thing on february th the new york times again refers to phone record and intercepted calls  let me quote them  american law enforcement intelligence agency intercepted the communications around the same times they were discovering the evidence that russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the democratic national committee three officials said the intelligence agencies then thought to learn whether the trump campaign was colluding with the russians on hacking or other efforts to influence the election the officials interviewed in recent weeks said that so far they have seen no evidence of such cooperation the official said that the intercepted communications are not limited to trump campaign officials and other associates of mr trump the call logs and intercepted communications are part of a larger trove of information that the fbi is sifting throughdays later the new york times then reports in the obama administrations last days some white house officials scrambled to spread information about russian efforts to undermine the presidential election of donald trump connections between the presidentelect and russians across the government but the increasingly hardtoescape conclusion that in our government  that individuals in our government were instead trying to undermine the new president by saying quote  this is the new york times again  at intelligence agencies there was a push to process as much raw intelligence in a possible analysis to keep the report at relatively low classification levels to ensure a widespread readership across the government and in some cases among them european allies this allowed the upload of as much information  intelligence as possible to intellipedia a secret wiki used by american analysts to share information sean hannity went on fox to say but protections which are known as minimization procedures have been put in place to protect americans that are not under warrant american citizens that are caught up in their surveillance and by the way their identities are protected their constitutional rights are protected now of course this was not the case with lieutenant general flynn because a transcript of his call was created and then given to intelligence officials who then leaked this information which is a felony to the press that printed itlast on fox news on march th judge andrew napolitano made the following statement three intelligence sources have informed fox news that president obama went outside the chain of command he didnt use the nsa he didnt use the cia he didnt use the fbi and he didnt use the department of justice he used gchq what is that its the initials for the british intelligence spying agency so simply by having two people saying to them the president needs transcripts of conversations involved in candidate trumps conversations involving presidentelect trump he was able to get it and theres no american fingerprints on thisputting the published accounts and common sense together this leads to a lotq  so sean are you saying that despite the findings the bipartisan findings of the senate intelligence committee mr spicer no theyre not findings theres a statement out today they have not begun this  as you know yesterday or two days ago the department of justice asked for an additional week so the statement clearly says that at this time that they dont believe that they have yet to go through the information the department of justice as you know has not supplied this but ive just read off to you  its interesting when the new york times reports q  i let you do that whole long answer can i just ask my questionmr spicer thank you appreciate itq  okay so are you saying that the president still stands by his allegation that president obama ordered wiretapping or surveillance of trump tower despite the fact that the senate intelligence committee says they see no indication that it happened does the president still stand by the allegationmr spicer no but  first of all he stands by it but again youre mischaracterizing what happened today q  no the senate has no indication im reading exactly from their statement mr spicer i understand that and at the same time they acknowledge that they have not been in contact with the department of justice again id go back to what i said at the beginning its interesting q  theyve been briefed by the fbi director theyve been  mr spicer hold on its interesting how at the same time where were you coming to the defense of that same intelligence committee and those members when they said there was no connection to russia you didnt seem to report it then there was no q  because mr spicer no no no so you want  hold on you want to comment and you want to perpetuate a false narrativeq  actually i did report that clapper said that i actually did mr spicer but when those individuals have gone out time and time again when chairman nunes has said number one that there was no information that hes aware of that that existed that got zero reporting number two when he went out yesterday and said i think its very possible you dont include that in the question markthe bottom line is is that the president said last night that he will be  that there will be additional information coming forward theres a ton of media reports out there that indicate that something was going on during the   election and i think its interesting where was the question of the new york times or these other outlets when that was going on where was the question q  so hell be vindicated you think hes going to be vindicatedmr spicer i believe he will jimq  yeah you were just quoting sean hannity there the house and senate intelligence committees are quoting the fbi director youre citing sean hannity and andrew napolitanomr spicer i also quoted  i get youre going to cherrypick  no no okay you also tend to overlook all of the other sources that  because i know you want to cherrypick it but at the  no no but you do but where was your concern about the new york times reporting you didnt seem to have a concern with thatq  we have done plenty of reporting on all of this seanmr spicer no no but you want to cherrypick one piece of commentary q  these connections between the aides of the president  associates of the president to the russians has all been looked at and its mr spicer no wait how do you know all this how do you seem to be such an expert on this q  im saying that this has been looked at sean weve all looked at it mr spicer how do you know its been looked atq  there have been mr spicer hold on hold on where is  im sorry im afraid to understand  can you tell me how you know that all of this has been looked atq  youre asking me whether or not its been looked atmr spicer you made a statement you said all of this has been looked atq  our outlet other outlets have reported mr spicer no no so  okay so when your outlet says its all been looked at q   on contacts between associates and aides of the president and the russians during the  campaign it sounds like during the context of that investigation there might have been some intercepted communications the house intelligence committee chairman did mention that and we have reported that others have reported that on our air and in various publications but sean what you are refusing to answer  the question that youre refusing to answer is whether or not the president still believes what he believes mr spicer no im not  i just said to jonathan i didnt refuse q  but you have a senate and house intelligence committee both leaders from both parties on both of those panels saying that they dont see any evidence of any wiretapping so how can the president go on and continue to say these thingsmr spicer because thats not  because youre mischaracterizing what chairman nunes said he said i think its possible  hes following up on this so to suggest that is actually  and youre stating unequivocally that you somehow q  he said if you take the president literally  he said if you take the president literally he is wrongmr spicer right and i think that weve already cleared that up and he said exactly that but the president has already said clearly when he referred to wiretapping he was referring to surveillanceq  right but it sounds like sean that you and the president are saying now well we dont mean wiretapping anymore because thats not true anymore so now were going to expand that to other forms of surveillance whats it going to be nextmr spicer no no jim i think thats cute but at the end of the day  weve talked about this for three or four days the president had wiretapping in quotes he was referring to broad surveillance and now youre basically going back we talked about this several days ago the bottom line is is that the investigation by the house and the senate has not been provided all of the information and when it does q  it sounds like your information is news reports not evidence not conversations with the fbi director mr spicer no no what  i think the president addressed that last night he said theres more to come these are merely pointing out that i think there is widespread reporting that throughout the  election there was surveillance that was done on a variety of people that came upq  there was an investigation going on into whether there were contacts between the presidents campaign and the russians of course theyre going to be looking at these various things i mean isnt that right mr spicer i get it somehow you seem to believe that you have all of this information youve been read in on all of these things which i find very interestingq  i havent been read in by the fbi director but the house and senate intelligence committees have beenmr spicer well no youre coming to some serious conclusions for a guy that has zero intelligence  laughter q  give me some credit sean mr spicer ill give you some q  a little intelligence maybe but no what im saying is that mr spicer clearance i wasnt done clearance maybe bothq  well come on now those two panels have spoken with the fbi director and have been told theres no evidence of this so why not just  why cant we just end this farce and just have the president say he was wrongmr spicer okay i think this question has been asked and answered jim its interesting how you jump to all of these conclusions about what they have and what they dont have and you seem to know all the answers but at the end of the day there was clearly a ton of reporting q  so a week from now were going to be wrong youre going to be rightmr spicer hold on jim let me answer  i think that there has been a vast amount of reporting which i just detailed about activity that was going on in the  election theres no question that there was surveillance techniques used throughout this i think by a variety of outlets that have reported this activity concludedand i think when you actually ask those two people whether or not  and as chairman nunes said yesterday when you take it literally and  wiretapping the president has already been very clear that he didnt mean specifically wiretapping he had it in quotes so i think to fall back on that is a false premise thats not what he said he was very clear about that when he talked about it yesterdaymajorq  so just to be clear youre good and the president is good with stories that have anonymous sources in themmr spicer no its interesting  i think when it comes to the russia story and the ontherecord sources who have been briefed by the fbi continue to conclude that theres nothing there you guys continue to fall back on these anonymous sources and perpetuate a false narrative and yet when it comes to us talking about all these reports in there you then criticize the anonymous sourcesq  im just asking mr spicer no its just interesting that sort of the double standard that exists when it comes to us citing stories when it comes  and then how you intend to use themq  so let me ask you what the president said last night he was asked by tucker carlson  youre in charge of the various intelligence apparatus that report to you you can ask them and he said mr spicer and again q  can i ask my question mr spicer yeahq  he said he was reluctant to do that so let me just put two things together earlier this week you told us when asked has the president directed the justice department to collect and distribute information to the various relevant congressional committees if i remember your answer correctly it was no we hadnt given that specific direction has that changed mr spicer noq  has he now directed the justice departmentmr spicer noq  and is he asking himself for the intelligence agencies that report to him to provide him specific answers to these underlying questions that are separate from the reports youre citingmr spicer noq  why notmr spicer because i think  weve covered this before i think that gets into interfering and i think that the appropriate process is to allow the house and the senate to do this so that it doesnt appear as though were interfering q  but interfering mr spicer i understand that but i mentioned to you this the other day major if we go ask them then youre going to turn around and say you guys interfered with something and you pressured them its a catch for us and the bottom line is is that i think the president made it clear two sundays ago that he wanted the house and senate intelligence committee to work with these agencies to collect the information and make a report thats what were doing in order to make sure that there is a separation from us so that you cant turn around and then accuse us of forcing or pressuring an agency to produce a document were asking them to go through the process of the separation of powers and actually going to those different entities the department of justice said yesterday that they want an additional week and were allowing that process to play throughgot it abbyq  sean is the president making these statements based on classified informationmr spicer im not going to get into what how the president makes a decision i think that what i think is clear though is  through the reporting that i just read  is that theres clearly widespread opensource material pointing to surveillance that was conducted during the  electionq  inaudible that that information is available to members of the house and the senate its public as you noted they are looking at that same information and they came to the conclusion that they have not seen mr spicer no no thats not trueq   any evidence to back up the presidents claim so if there is other information why wont the president release itmr spicer again im not going to get into that yet i think the president discussed that last night on his interview and well let the process play out i understand what he discussed q  he discussed these reports mr spicer i understand what he discussed they have clearances in the house and the senate intelligence committees theyre able to conduct thisalexisq  sean id like to ask you about two topics but can you help us a little by calling on peter right now mr spicer no im going to q  call it mr spicer i understand i actually call the question alexis if you dont want to answer the question i can call on somebody elseq  could you call on the new york times pleasemr spicer no thank you gabiq  thanks sean in the case that judge watson issued against the restraining order against trumps second travel  sorry the presidents second travel ban he included one of the presidents tweets and this was also included in the washington state case so im wondering does it give the president any pause that this virtual paper trail is creating  is having an impact on advancing his agendamr spicer well i mean i think that the department of justices statement speaks for itself when it comes to that last night but the federal law that i read out clearly gives the president the authority this is what we argued during the first one i think for a judge to ignore that statute and talk about tweets or interpreting something that happened during the campaign trail is not in keeping with how theyre supposed to interpret the law im not going to continue to commentwe tailored that additional  that second executive order to comply with the judges order i think  so to go back now and to say well based on how the first order was conceived makes absolutely no sense but im going to let the department of justice litigate that how they do itthe second order literally was tailored to the concerns that were rendered by the th circuit in the first executive order so for them to then turn around the make arguments that are nongermane seems kind of odd but ill let the department of justice do thatzekeq  is the president concerned that comments made by his staff came up in this lawsuit it shows comments by stephen miller saying that the second travel ban would have roughly the same policy outcome as the first that was the intent that that was used by the judge in that case to sort of  to get that inaudible yesterday is he concerned that theres mixed messaging coming out of the west wing on this banmr spicer no hes not and i think that the department of justice will be pursuing avenues that will seek to remedy this i think when you read through the courts ruling in hawaii in particular it just doesnt seem to make senseas i mentioned to gabi the second executive order was literally tailored so to go back and talk about statements that occurred in some cases well before even the first one seems to not be an accurate reading of the law but ill let the department of justice be the ones that argue this and make the appropriate legal argumenthunter olivier im sorryq  i have one more for you to go back to your long list of sort of news reports you mentioned  one that you reached that perhaps the gchq was involved did the president ever raise this in his conversation with theresa may and if that were to pan out would that imperil the special relationship between the twomr spicer again these are just  that happened i think two days ago it was something that was reported on air i think the point is is that theres been q  was it raised mr spicer no no it has not been raised but i do think that again were not  all were doing is literally reading off what other stations and people have reported and i think that casts into concern some of the activities that may have occurred during the  election were not casting judgment on that i think the idea is to say that if these organizations these individuals came to these conclusions they merit looking intoolivierq  thanks sean i got a couple for you theres a news report about the presidents meeting with the saudi defense ministerdeputy crown prince that says that the defense minister told the president about a plot a terrorist plot against the united states did that happen whats the nature of that how worried should americans bemr spicer were obviously never going to comment on any kind of specific threats to the homeland were obviously committed to ensuring the safety of every american but it should be no secret that we share intelligence amongst a variety of countries and so we would never comment on a potential threat or not that existed but we appreciate several countries that we work with closely to make sure that we do what we can to protect the homelandq  one more secretary tillerson in asia said that  years of diplomatic efforts have failed to get north korea to denuclearize thats plainly true but the question i guess that comes up is does the president plan a break from diplomacy altogether are we looking now at only the use of force or some other coercive measuresmr spicer im not going to comment i think the president never takes anything off the table thats something hes been very clear about and  with that blakeq  sean over the course of the campaign the president made a couple different  many comments about the budget and the deficit at one point he said he thought that he could get rid of the national debt over the course of eight years at another point he said that he would insist on a balanced budget relatively soon now the base line that the administration is giving us is well at least were not adding onto the deficit which is nearly half a trillion dollars so im curious as to how we got from that point to now to where  he was talking at one point about eliminating a bunch and now its adding onto itmr spicer i think director mulvaney addressed that i think  look a couple things number one the senate dragged its feet on getting director mulvaney confirmed and in office so i think we were way  we were behind the curve in having a director of omb we got in here  i think we produced a blueprint that is consistent with the presidents principles and priorities but hes already made it very clear that well have a budget probably sometime in may that will outline the more specifics of the revenue piece the entitlement piece and the full details of all thisbut eliminating a  trillion debt and tackling the current deficit is something thats going to take a little bit of time and something that the president is committed to reducing i think weve talked very extensively about the presidents commitment to protecting taxpayer dollars and using them more efficiently this budget and a lot of the action the president took on other projects including the f and the next generation of af show that the president is committed on a very very personal basis to getting involved in programs and policies to reduce the deficit and respect taxpayer money so this is step one and its a down payment on that goalq  are there future steps  there are lots of cuts in here but no matter which way you splice the numbers anyone will tell you if you want to drop it somehow youve got to get to entitlementsmr spicer i understandq  is that on the table potentially yes or nomr spicer as director mulvaney put it he was chosen for this job because of his commitment to fiscal austerity and respect of taxpayer dollars and budgeting skills and i think that weve got to get passed today let us get down that and well have more for youbut again i think this budget is a huge down payment on the presidents goal of showing his commitment to fiscal responsibility and respecting the taxpayereamonq  sean tax day is coming up a lot of americans put together their tax returns when the president puts together his tax returns this year will he release it publicly presumably hes not under audit rightmr spicer well st patricks day is tomorrow  thats what im more focused on q  presumably his  returns are not under audit yet mr spicer right again well cross that bridge when it comes to it i think the president has been very clear about his position on his tax returns and well have to see where it goes from there but the president has been very clear throughout the campaign and consistent that hes under a routine auditjohnq  thank you sean reading the draft of the budget and listening to director mulvaneys comments yesterday and today it would appear that the national endowment of the arts would be phased out entirely in two years can you name any other government programs or even cabinet departments  such as housing and urban development and education  in which its entire function may be phased out or reduced to another agency in government or even the statemr spicer john those here from omb is the appropriate person to ask on that i know that theyve done several briefings on the budget we can have omb definitely get back to you on this if you can contact him after thiskaitlanq  going back to the fact that the president used wiretap in quotes and last night he said it was very important that it was in quotes but out of the four tweets when he accuses barack obama of wiretapping him he only used quotes in two of them in two of them he specifically said that he tapped his phones he didnt use the term wiretapping and just minutes ago you said it was communications being swept up so can you definitively say that he still feels like barack obama wiretapped trump tower or does he feel like it was broadly surveilled which is itmr spicer look he was very clear about this last night he talked about it as you said q  he wasnt mr spicer yeah he was he said that he meant it he put it in quotes it was very broad and so thats what he meant by the use of the term q  but was it phonetapping was it mr spicer no it was surveillance i think weve covered this like  timesq  theres no specific answer of what it was what did president obama do to mr spicer i understand that but thats the point of them looking into this kaitlan i think the idea is to look into this have the house and senate intelligence committees look into this and report backq  i want to follow up on that if all this comes out and theres no proof that president obama had any role in any wiretapping if there was no wiretapping will president trump then offer an apology to president obamamr spicer i was asked this like three times this week and i think the answer is were not going to prejudge what the outcome of this is i think weve got to let the process work its will and then when theres a report that comes out conclusive from there then well be able to comment but to jump ahead of this process at this point would be inappropriateand i go to bryan crabtree of salem radio georgiaq  thank you sean for taking questions from a talkradio host right here in georgia and not in the dc swamp first i have two questions first to the presidents tax returns and classified information president trump campaigned on draining the swamp the american people then want to know why he inaudible and commissioner inaudible has not yet been fired by the trump administration my second question is with regard to there are  many conservatives are really concerned that paul ryan the speaker of the house is leading president trump down a very wrong path on healthcare how do you react to thatmr spicer well on the first one theres no personnel updates with respect to  with the exception of the ones that i mentioned today on the second donald trump is not one to be led down a path by anyone i think he is  he talked today at the lunch with the taoiseach and speaker ryan that hes working handinglove with the speaker he talked about it last night this is a commitment that he has to enacting healthcare this is a process that he is committed to wants to see through because of a goal that he wants to achieve which is making a more patientcentric healthcare system that lowers the cost and increases the optionsbut he doesnt get led down any path he leads very clearly and i think if you listen to speaker ryan today hes in agreement that theres been a strong partnership between the house the administration and i think the senate so far to make sure that we get this bill done and thats what our goal is going to be and thats  so i would argue that weve actually done a pretty good job of getting that donejonathanq  i want to ask you about the decision to cut the national institutes of health budget by  percent its as you know a very important part of the government funding medical research budget director mulvaney yesterday acknowledged that the private sector cant fill that gap when there are rare diseases we do need a really robust government presence the president invited a raredisease patient to his speech to congress to talk about medical innovation how do you square those things when youre cutting nih by  percent and many conservatives actually wanted to increase the budgetmr spicer i think director mulvaney actually  somebody asked him during the qa period the same questionq  but he suggested that it wouldnt  like my take from listening to him yesterday was that it wouldnt be cut i mean i almost wrote thatmr spicer theres this assumption in washington jonathan that if you get less money its a cut and i think that the reality is that in a lot of these theres efficiencies duplicity ways to spend money better and i think if youre wasting a lot of money thats not a true dollar spent and i think when you look at the way that director mulvaney and the president approached this budget it was can we ask  can we get more with the same dollar can we find duplicity can we find efficiencies can we combine facilities in some cases at nih to enhance a better experience whereby we actually have an outcome thats reduced savingsbut to assume that because you spend a ton of dollars youre going to get a better outcome i mean with all due respect you look at the district of columbia they spend by far more per capita than any other city in the country on education and i think they have tremendous issues that are constantly being dealt with in their education systemso to assume that just because you throw money at a problem its somehow magically solved is a very washington way of looking at a budget problemq  but they believe mr spicer i understand that and i think part of the issues that were working  as the director outlined a couple weeks ago during the passback process is to work with them to talk to each of these agencies and departments about how to walk through their budget in a way that ensures they can continue to do the core functions that they want while finding ways to reduce waste get rid of  enhance efficiencies and get rid of duplicitybut that is a very washington way of looking at a problem when you say lets just look at how much we spend as a measure of how much we care or how much were going to get done and i think that the president has been very clear as to what his priorities on this budget are and the outcomes that we expect from every dollar that we spend so for being in office for  days or someodd days whatever its been weve had a unique ability to go forward so far and make a very strong commitment to enhancing our national security to protect the country and to keep america safe and its citizens safe while at the same time making sure that we dont ask for people to work harder to spend more to washington  send more to washington that gets ultimately wasted i just dont see how thats showing respect to the american people or to the american taxpayer especially when so many people are working two sometimes three jobs or both parents are working just to get by pay the mortgage and were saying hey dont worry keep sending more money to washington  and were not going to take the timebut there should be a review of all these agencies director mulvaney was pointing out how many unauthorized agencies and departments and programs we have throughout the government if were going to do that at some point there should be a debate on whether or not these agencies and programs are achieving their mission and if they are then great fund them but if theyre not we shouldnt be asking hardworking american taxpayers to send more money to washington to fund things that dont further those goalsthank you guys very much i look forward to seeing you all tomorrow take care have a good oneend pm edt

wishes tonight and also our hope is that my presence here tonight is a visible sign of americas enduring friendship with ireland and all her peopleyou know i actually received the invitation to be here tonight nearly two months before the president and i were sworn in for these offices of ours it was one of the very first invitations i received after the election and im humbled to say it was the first one that i accepted and im honored and privileged to be here tonight applausetonight is really a family affair its been said before from this podium this evening i can tell you it feels that way to our family and its a joy for me tonight to be joined by my wife of  years and our new second lady karen pence applausekaren and i are also delighted to be joined tonight by our irish daughter charlotte rose applause and my irish sisters annie and mary traveled from far across the country to be with us tonight and if there werent all these inches of snow mr taoiseach i can assure my mother  years young red hair crystal blue eyes would still be here but i know shes smiling applausethis really does feel more like a homecoming for us too to be honest with you and ill talk about that on a personal level a little bit laterit is my privilege to be here tonight on behalf of the president of the united states to address the american ireland fund since its founding in  the fund and its sister organizations have raised a remarkable  million dollars to support peace prosperity and cultural accomplishment on the emerald isle thats a staggering amount of generosity as weve already heard before ireland and all who call it home have benefited tremendously from the generosity of you who are gathered here tonight and all who have gone beforeand thats worth dwelling on theres a reason why so many in this room  and in this country  have been so generous towards ireland we may be separated by an ocean but the american people have always been bound by a kinship to the irish people and we always will applausethe bond between the people of america and the people of ireland stretches back into the mists of american history drawn by the promise of this brave new world the sons and daughters of ireland began leaving their land for ours as far back as the th century they came here one by one or sometimes in small bands but what they lacked in numbers we already heard tonight they more than made up in courageirish immigrants and their descendants became proud patriots in america thousands fought for their adopted homeland  and the timeless ideals we hold dear  in our revolutionary war no fewer than nine as youve already heard signers of the declaration of independence no fewer than four of the founding fathers at our constitutional convention could trace their roots to ireland and no less a man than george washington himself our first president referred to ireland as a friend of my country and so it will always be applausefrom the revolutionary war to the irish brigades in our civil war irish americans have fought for freedom in every american conflict and before i go one step further would the men and women who are with us here tonight who have worn the uniform of the united states of america please stand and give us the opportunity to thank you one more time for your service to this country you make us proud applausebut irelands contributions to america didnt end with the establishment of the shining city on a hill indeed none saw that beacon more clearly or with more excitement than the irish across the sea whereas once they had come to america slowly in a trickle suddenly the children of ireland came here in a swell as history recordsthey spread to every corner of this continent settling in cities and towns in places where none had settled before and wherever they went opportunity and prosperity soon followed from the vantage point of the present its clear that the irish have left an indelible mark on the history of this country for the betterment of the american people and the betterment of the worldour history books are filled with the names of irish immigrants and their descendants more than  million americans can trace their heritage back to ireland a reminder that the irish are one of the strongest and most vibrant threads of our national fabricand tonight its an honor to be here on behalf of president trump to reaffirm the united states enduring commitment to the republic of ireland and northern ireland to the peace process and above all else to the timeless and enduring friendship between our people and yours applausetonight id like to express our friendship by letting you know that americans of all backgrounds have been heartened to see irelands extraordinary accomplishments in recent years the story of the irish everywhere is one of facing hardship and emerging stronger for it and theres perhaps no better recent example than irelands remarkable economic success story over the past decadeits amazing to think of irelands recovery after the global financial crisis it was the first country to exit the imfs eurozone economic assistance program and for the last two years ireland has been one of the fastest growing economies in the european union applausei firmly believe one of the key reasons for this is the drive the determination the character and the ingenuity of the irish people wherever they may live taoiseach irelands success is testament i can say on behalf of everyone here to your strong leadership these past six years and many leaders around the world would surely do well to emulate your example in ireland applauseanother sign of our friendship with ireland is americas robust economic partnership with you we host many innovative and successful irish companies here in the united states and in  im pleased to see that irish direct investment in america totaled  billion creating many goodpaying american jobstonight im proud to say with great confidence that our bond is strong and it will grow stronger still applausebut im not just here to discuss the republic of ireland on behalf of president trump id also like to congratulate the people of northern ireland on their election only two weeks ago which had one of the highest turnouts in recent memorythe advance of peace and prosperity in northern ireland is one of the great success stories of the past  years many in this room and the ireland funds across the world have played a leading role in fostering this progress senator mitchell you have been properly paid tribute tonight let me thank you personally its an honor to be with you tonight im proud to be an american the nation that you call home and im proud of what senator mitchell and all of you have done to advance the peace and the prosperity of people all across the island applauseand we thank those unsung heroes in ireland and northern ireland who dayin and dayout do the difficult and important work of strengthening communities educating children building that brighter future for emerald isle and all who call it home their heroic actions bring to mind someone else a proud son of ireland a proud servant of america  thomas francis meagheron this side of the atlantic we remember meagher for his bravery in our civil war he led the irish brigade i mentioned just a few moments ago and he ultimately rose to the rank of brigadier general he was originally from ireland in  he famously designed the irish tricolor that flies over the republic to this very dayupon presenting his design he spoke words that resonate even today and i quote the white in the center signifies a lasting truce between the orange and the green  and i trust that beneath its folds the hands of the irish protestant and the irish catholic may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhoodtonight lets all pray that those hands of brotherhood may never separate applauselets also pray to strengthen the hands of friendship that reach across the atlantic between the people of ireland and northern ireland and the people of united statesthis bond was forged by our forebears and it endures to this day and its bequeathed to us to strengthen itwhether they left their homeland for another or stayed in the country of their birth they shared a heritage  and more than that they shared hope for a brighter future and they strived to find it with all their mightso many millions of them found it here on these shores and were proud that they call america home the story of the irish in america is the story of america itself and as i close let me just say its hard for me to express the pride that i feel on night like tonight because my little family is a small part of that story the story of ireland and americalike so many of my fellow countrymen i literally carry ireland with me everywhere i go on one of my first trips to ireland when i was a young man i was sitting  what did you call it  in a public house laughter pat morrisseys pub  its still open in doonbeg to this day pat was around back then and he let me help out behind the bar ill never forget the little old lady who spoke to me and i told her very quickly that i was related to the morrisseys distant cousins and i said actually im irish by heritage and she looked at me and smile and said you dont have to tell me son youve got a face like the map of ireland laughterit does all go back to that day it was inauguration day just a few short weeks ago people ask me what i was thinking about surrounded by my wife and my children our beautiful new daughterinlaw my mother was just there a few seats behind the president i just kept thinking of that day in april in  that was the day when richard michael cawley stepped off the boat on ellis island he was in his early s when he steamed into upper new york bay aboard the andania the ship that carried him herei cant imagine what the sight of the statue of liberty meant to him that day holding aloft the torch of freedom my grandfather went home to be with the lord when it was in about my th year but we were very close he said i was the only irishman born among the four boys in our family laughter not sure yet what that meant but i was flattered by itmy grandpa had grown up in a little town called tobercurry in county sligo when i was young man i had a chance to visit that house before they tore it down it was just a tworoom house where his eight brothers and sisters grew up and i literally walked up the hill that  when karen and i and the kids visited ireland just a few years ago we walked up that hill as well the legend in our family was my great grandmother had stood outside that little house and looked over at the ox mountains and looked off to the west and told him that he needed to go because she said theres a future there for youhe wouldnt speak to his mother for  years and when he said the old country he said with a reverence that i could never adequately express he talked about crossing the pond talked about the heartbreak of that separationbut as i stood on that inaugural stage i just kept thinking of that irishman i kept thinking of what he would be thinking about looking down from glory and i know two things for surenumber one knowing me as well as he did he would be extremely surprised laughter number two i have to think he just thought he was right he was right about america he was right to summon the courage as generations did before and since to come here and follow their dreams and make the contributions that they did he was right to drive that bus for  years in chicago he was right to raise that irascible redhead that would marry a fasttalking salesman and follow work down to a little small farm town in southern indiana and raise six kids with the same heritage and the same values that she had been raised withthe truth is that whatever honors i will receive over the course of my service as vice president and to receive an honor in the name of the irish people and my irish heritage will count as chief among them because all that i am and all that i will ever be and all the service that i will ever render is owing to my irish heritage and i will summon what is the best of it as i serve the people of this country with the faith with the determination with the cheerfulness the humility and the humor that is characteristic of the great people of the emerald isleso heres to ireland heres to the united states of america heres to our shared heritage and heres to the confident confident hope that the ties between our people and the irish people will only grow and expand as the years go on to the betterment of our people and the worldthank you very much for this honor tonight and god bless you all applauseend pm edt

anniversary of american independence today i call attention to another anniversary the th birthday of the very great andrew jackson applause and he loved tennessee and so do i  to tell you that applauseon this day in  andrew jackson was born on the backwoods soil of the carolinas from poverty and obscurity jackson rose to glory and greatness  first as a military leader and then as the seventh president of the united stateshe did it with courage with grit and with patriotic heart and by the way he was one of our great presidents applausejackson was the son of the frontier his father died before he was born his brother died fighting the british in the american revolution and his mother caught a fatal illness while tending to the wounded troops at the age of  andrew jackson was an orphan and look what he was able to do look what he was able to buildit was during the revolution that jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite does that sound familiar to you laughter i wonder why they keep talking about trump and jackson jackson and trump oh i know the feeling andrew laughtercaptured by the redcoats and ordered to shine the boots of a british officer jackson simply refused the officer took his saber and slashed at jackson leaving gashes in his head and hand that remained permanent scars for the rest of his life these were the first and far from the last blows that andrew jackson took for his country that he loved so muchfrom that day on andrew jackson rejected authority that looked down on the common people first as a boy when he bravely served the revolutionary cause next as the heroic victor at new orleans where his ragtag  and it was ragtag  militia but they were tough and they drove the british imperial forces from america in a triumphant end to the war of  he was a real general that oneand finally as president  when he reclaimed the peoples government from an emerging aristocracy jacksons victory shook the establishment like an earthquake henry clay secretary of state for the defeated president john quincy adams called jacksons victory mortifying and sickening oh boy does this sound familiar laughter have we heard this laughter this is terrible he said there had been no greater calamity in the nations historythe political class in washington had good reason to fear jacksons great triumph the rich and powerful jackson said too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes jackson warned they had turned government into an engine for the support of the few at the expense of the manyandrew jackson was the peoples president and his election came at a time when the vote was finally being extended to those who did not own property to clean out the bureaucracy jackson removed  percent of the federal workforce he launched a campaign to sweep out government corruption totally he didnt want government corruption he expanded benefits for veterans he battled the centralized financial power that brought influence at our citizens expense he imposed tariffs on foreign countries to protect american workers that sounds very familiar wait till you see whats going to be happening pretty soon folks laughter its time its time andrew jackson was called many names accused of many things and by fighting for change earned many many enemies today the portrait of this orphan son who rose to the presidency hangs proudly in the oval office opposite the portrait of another great american thomas jefferson i brought the andrew jackson portrait there applause right behind me right  boom over my left shoulder now im honored to sit between those two portraits and to use this high office to serve defend and protect the citizens of the united states it is my great honor i will tell you thatfrom that desk i can see out the wonderful beautiful large great window to an even greater magnolia tree standing strong and tall across the white house lawn that tree was planted there many years ago when it was just a sprout carried from these very grounds came right from here applause beautiful treethat spout was nourished it took root and on this his th birthday andrew jacksons magnolia is a sight to behold i looked at it actually this morning really beautiful applause but the growth of that beautiful tree is nothing compared to growth of our beautiful nation that growth has been made possible because more and more of our people have been given their dignity as equals under law and equals in the eyes of godandrew jackson as a military hero and genius and a beloved president but he was also a flawed and imperfect man a product of his time it is the duty of each generation to carry on the fight for justice my administration will work night and day to ensure that the sacred rights which god has bestowed on his children are protected for each and every one of you for each and every american applausewe must all remember jacksons words that in the planter the farmer the mechanic and the laborer we will find muscle and bone of our country so true so true now we must work in our time to expand  and we have to do that because we have no choice were going to make america great again folks were going to make america great again  applause  to expand the blessings of america to every citizen in our land and when we do watch us grow watch whats happening you see it happening already

enrollment numbers showing that almost half a million fewer americans signed up for obamacare this year than last the bottom line is obamacare is on the brink of failure and together with congress the president is working to deliver positive change to our broken healthcare system through both the ahca and through additional policy changes that will increase competition and decrease costsalso today in detroit the president made major announcements on cafe greenhouse gas emissions standards for the auto sector when leaders from around the us auto industry met with the president during one of his first days in office they discussed specific actions that he could take to eliminate government barriers to job creation and their industry specifically they sent him a letter unanimously requesting the president reinstate the datadriven midterm review of fuel economy ghg rules through model year  without prejudging the outcome and to harmonize federal requirementsthe president listened and researched the request he concluded that this was the right thing today and he quickly took action today in michigan the president celebrated the american manufacturing and ingenuity that this administration will continue to set free from unnecessary overcomplicated and unproductive regulation our nations great auto manufacturers no longer have to wonder if they have an ally or an adversary in the white house the president clearly showed once again today that hes committed to working together with businesses and unions to rethink our regulatory system to grow our economythe presidents regulatory reform is being applauded across many industries not just the auto industry that we saw here in detroit this morning the national association of home builders released its monthly index for march which is set at its alltime level in  years the nahb directly cited president trumps actions on regulatory reform specifically mentioning his recent executive orders on the waters of the united states rule as a cause of the surgeunder the presidents leadership the united states will once again be the worlds greatest magnet for innovation and job creationonce we get to nashville the president will head to andrew jacksons hermitage where he will take a tour and lay a wreath on the presidents tomb in commemoration of his th birthday which we celebrate todayof course tomorrow is budget day omb director mulvaney did a background briefing earlier this morning theres a transcript available by the pool for those who werent able to listen in tomorrow the presidents budget blueprint will be delivered to the hill and posted online and tomorrow afternoon director mulvaney will join us at the daily press briefing for all of your budgetrelated questions finally i want to make sure that all of you remember to get your requests in for the easter egg roll the lottery went live today on recreationgov its available through saturday of this weekand with that ill take your questionsq  scott on the yahoorussia  oh sean who is scott i dont even mr spicer no thats okay laughter q  on the yahoo russia hacking was anyone from the administration read in before those indictments and is the president planning any other actions against russia after those indictments around this yahoo hackmr spicer im not sure if anyone from the department of justice read anyone in but im not aware of that i would refer you to the department of justice on thatq  are there any other actions on russiamr spicer i cant  thats a department of justice issueq  on the tax returns that were published last night a couple questions on that firstly the statement last night said that the white house believes that msnbc i presume is breaking the law are there intentions there  i dont know if it would come from the presidents personal lawyer or from the white house  to pursue legal actions against msnbcmr spicer id have to follow up with the presidents personal lawyer but i mean theres several issues there that are concerning with how they did itnumber one it is illegal to publish somebodys individual tax returns thats against the law and its ironic of all institutions to have nbc news in so many ways brag about something like that they are an institution  and then not only did they violate it but then they went on last night and through today and questioned the presidents integrity by whether or not he put them out its ironic that a news institution like nbc news that has sat in the briefing room day after day and questioned our integrity and questioned whether or not we had the proof for certain issues and allegations and policies and then sat there and speculated openly and pushed a narrative about whether the president was behind this its despicable and reprehensible and they should be ashamed of themselves as how they conducted themselves regarding this entire episodeq  to be clear the president did not himself personally send those tax returnsmr spicer no and i think its offensive to ask that question and i think that frankly how nbc news handled this and the idea that they made a spectacle of it just shows how desperate they are for ratingsq  and then to follow up on that i mean last night as that report was about to come out the white house released a statement that included two numbers the amount that the president paid in taxes  income taxes  that year and then his full income i want to understand why during the campaign a move was never made to just release those numbers and would the white house consider releasing those numbers for maybe the past  yearsmr spicer number one those numbers were obtained and released to us illegally they were provided to us by them to ask us for comment but to sort of use one illegal act and then say we should act further on that is somewhat preposterous the president has asked and answered this issue over and over again throughout the campaign and multiple times since hes been presidentso the issue still stands and i think to use the fruit to talk about well because they obtained one year illegally we should respond in kind with several years is preposterousq  sean can i ask you with these tax returns do you know if these  numbers were under auditmr spicer i dont i dont knowq  can i ask you separate  republicans and democrats in the house intel committee said today they still dont have any evidence of wiretapping will the president apologize to former president obama for this they still have no evidence of thismr spicer i think what chairman nunes said is twofold one is that he said he did not have anything at this time two is that he said that can understand that the president has tweeted that there is a lot there with regarding surveillance during the cycle and again i think this is  the department of justice asked for an additional week to provide information we are still at the beginning stages of this we asked both the house and senate to look into this we hope they will we believe that they will have further updates as they go through this processbut again these two individuals today were making comments on where we stand right now and i think as we go through the process i think as i mentioned yesterday the president feels very comfortable that there is information out there regarding surveillance that was conducted during the  electionq  sean followup nunes said i dont think there was an actual tap of trump tower youve broadened it to surveillance does the white house still believe that there was a wiretap of trump towermr spicer i answered this question two days ago in the briefing and the president has discussed this i think its something that he was asked by tucker carlson and hell answer it tonight but he was very clear that you know he used the wiretap generally he put it in quotes to mean that it counts for surveillance and all types of activity of that sortq  sean can i ask you about the healthcare plan republicans on the hill today were saying that they had gotten some sense that you guys had accepted changes to that plan are there mr spicer well i think one of the things that ill say is that the president has been very clear  ive mentioned this from the briefing room several times director mulvaney and director price have mentioned it as well  that we want to work with the house to achieve the best outcome and if members have ideas i know that theres talk of a managers amendment and were obviously in talks with speaker ryan and the entire leadership team over there and is director mulvaney and secretary price to get the best outcome based on the feedback from membersbut thats why he continues to bring in groups of senators groups of house members  to have those discussions to find out if we can achieve the best outcomeq  but at this point have you agreed to anything that would go in the managers amendmentmr spicer i dont  im not privy to  this is not  once we have a managers amendment that we can talk about we will but there is an ongoing discussion about areas that we can get to and again one of the points that i talked about in the briefing yesterday is theres a lot of ideas out there and i think at the end of the day we have to make sure that all of those ideas continue to the goal of growing the vote from  upthere are some ideas that while have merit and may have a lot of support dont have enough merit  have support to help grow the bill or have a majority support and thats important when youre looking at trying to pass legislation through the house or the senateq  sounds like there are some things that you can rule out then can you tell us whats definitely not going to be in theremr spicer again this is something that was an ongoing process with the house at this time and im sure well go through it with the senate as well and i dont want to sit here and prejudge where we are at this stage because it is ongoingq  just to follow up on that do you believe does the white house believe there are enough votes in the senate right now for hca to passmr spicer i think obviously the focus is  i dont mean to sound evasive but the first goal is to get it through the house and then to worry about the senate i think until you have a product that comes out of the house with a managers amendment that the speaker is working on theres not something necessarily that every senator can fully make a determination as to how their vote is i think theyve started to talk there was a group over yesterday as youre well aware  senator cruz senator sasse senator strange several others  that provided their input to staff as far as things that theyd like to see staff is going to continue to work on thatremember that as that bill leaves the house it will be an opportunity for senators to have their say as well and so this is part of a legislative processq  on a separate subject some members of congress have asked for james comey to say one way or another whether theres an investigation into the campaign and russia ties does the white house does the president believe that for the sake of clarity that james comey should be more specific about whether an investigation existsmr spicer im not going to interfere with those discussions i think thats up to  i dont want to get in the middle of congress and their request so ill leave that up to director comey and to congress to determine whats appropriateq  does the president want to know whether an investigation existsq  does he knowmr spicer i think theres an area  its not a question of one abby its a question of weve made it clear what we  how we think this has to happen i think whats important to note is that every single member that im aware of that has publicly come out that has been briefed has said that there is nothing no connection between the campaign and russia and i think we have to be very clear that there are two issues theres always been a discussion in the ic community network about russian activity then theres the bigger issue that the media has been obsessed with which is whether or not there was a connection between the trump campaign and russian officials every single person that has been briefed on that secondary matter has said that theyve seen nothing there including director clapper including others that have been briefed by director comey  senator cotton senator burr senator  chairman nunes  over and over again and again its interesting that when we talk about proof  as far as the previous question on wiretapping  i dont know how much more proof that we can get in terms of the number of people that have been briefed that have said that when it comes to involvement with russia theres nothing that they  that has been shown to anybody who was aware of the situationand so i dont know how many times we have to answer this question before people who have been briefed come up with the same conclusion that theres nothing thereq  did the president meet with the mayor of flint today did that meeting take placemr spicer i believe he did speak with her briefly before they departed q  do you know if he raised a question in the listening session about lead in paint and whether the paint are still as good given the lead regulations do you know at all where his thinking is coming from on that any thoughts about mr spicer i dont i dontq   of what the two of them discussed during their meetingmr spicer it wasnt a meeting  i mean it was on the way out the president met with several individuals and he had an opportunity to talk to them about  just thanking them and it was a brief conversationq   the president request for the two of them to spend some time togethermr spicer  follow up from the last time that he had been in flint so im not exactly sure what the nature of how it came to be i can ask a little bit from our staff how that came to be but i know that they wanted a chance to say hiq  on the cafe regulations the president kind of sounded like he believed that fuel efficiency regulations shouldnt get in the way of auto companies creating more cars does he have an opinion on where those fuel efficiency regulations ought to be does he think that they are too highmr spicer just to be clear i think one of the things thats interesting  and i know there was a briefing for you guys on this  that what the obama administration did is rush through a process that they had promised the automakers and frankly the unions as well as far as how this determination would be right now weve got three entities looking at efficiency and emission standards i think what the president actually went back to is say that we are going to follow on the process that the obama administration originally had promised those automakers and unions thats simply it  is agreeing to a process that had been agreed to early onq  he hasnt himself prejudged what he would like the outcome to bemr spicer no he said it very clearly during his remarks that all he wanted to do was return to the promise that was made to these individuals thank you guys very much return to your seats and hopefully you can stay safeend pm edt

2017-03-15,Press Briefing by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney Previewing the President's FY18 Budget ,james s brady press briefing room am edtmr czwartacki good morning this is director mulvaneys review of the  budget blueprint i want to reiterate again that this is on background  this is embargoed his remarks are on the record but embargoed until  tomorrow or in other words tonight  am is  until the embargo is holding and with that director mulvaney will come up he will be on the record and have a few words thank youdirector mulvaney thanks john and i apologize im going to try and speak a little bit more loudly than i ordinarily do they tell me theres folks on the phone who cant hear so if you hear me projecting a little more than normal thats for the benefit of the folks who arent herethanks for coming i apologize for being a few minutes late the simple message is fairly straightforward youve heard from me before so ill make a very brief comment and then well take your questions which is this is the america first budget in fact we wrote it using the presidents own words we went through his speeches we went through articles that have been written about his policies we talked to him and we wanted to know what his policies were and we turned those policies into numbers so you have an america first candidate you have an america first budgetknowing what you know about the president you could imagine what that budget would look like before you even see it which is that there will be more money on defense   billion we could talk about more of that in a second theres more money for enforcing security at the border theres more money for enforcing laws on the books just generally then theres more money for things like private and public school choice conversely since the president wanted to do that without adding to the alreadyprojected  billion deficit in fiscal year  there were reductions elsewhere to offset dollar for dollar all of those increases so we say plusup the defense topline number by  billion you will in other parts of the budget find a corresponding  billions worth of reductions so the president accomplishes his priorities without adding to the deficit thats not to say the balance of the budget is balanced next year it doesnt weve simply not added to the deficit in order to accomplish these policiesas a result youll see reductions exactly where you would expect it from a president who just ran on an america first campaign youll see reductions in the state department well talk more about that in a second youll see reductions in the epa in fact youll see reductions in many agencies as he tries to shrink the role of government drive efficiencies go after waste duplicative programs those types of things if he said it on the campaign its in the budgetill talk about the defense line for a second weve worked very closely with the defense department to make sure a couple of things  that this funds their needs but does so in a responsible fashion in terms of what they can actually spend this year the defense department has told us this is the amount of money they need and can spend effectively this year were not throwing money after a problem and claiming that we have fixed it the defense department has given us every assurance they can spend  this full  billion  next year in a responsible fashion and i believe general mattis when he tells me thatregarding some of the reductions youll see a fairly dramatic reduction in state department that is not a commentary on the presidents policies towards the state department that is a comment on the presidents policies towards whats in their budget the foreign aid line items in the budget many of them just happen to fall within the state department functions the president ran saying he would spend less money overseas and more money back home so when you go to implement that policy you go to things like foreign aid and those get reduced if those had been in the department of education youd see a more dramatic decrease in education if they had been in energy youd see the decrease there it just so happens under the way we spend money in this country that the foreign aid line items fall within state department so i think the number youre going to see in the state department is fairly significant off the top of my head its  percent reductionanyway i can take some questions well go through the specifics and i think were releasing the document whenaide  am tomorrow director mulvaney sorryaide  amdirector mulvaney  am tomorrow morning yes sirq  you said that you went through the presidents speeches and this reflects that the president also during the campaign had railed against the national debt which is approaching  trillion i know you say youre not adding to projected deficits but yet you are willing to take on deficits of hundreds of billions of dollars and my basic question is why if the president railed against the national debt that keeps on skyrocketingdirector mulvaney yeah and im sorry should i repeat the question for the benefit of the people who are gone or should i  okay for the people who are not here the question relates to debt and if i was going to paraphrase the president railed against the deficits yet doesnt reduce them in this blueprint is that your questionq  yeah i mean the national debt keeps rising and director mulvaney thats fine so the national debt keeps going up why then havent we done something about that in the blueprint is that an accurate restatement of your question more or less and i apologize if i butchered thatthe answer is pretty simple which is that this is a budget blueprint not a complete budget so what you will not see here you will not see revenue projections you will not see larger policy statements and importantly you will not see anything having to do with mandatory spending and anybody who looks at the deficit and knows the issues of the deficit knows that you cannot balance the deficit in the discretionary budget the balance budget is not balanced this year we expect the budget deficit to be roughly the  billion for fy as estimated by the cbo and were assuming that to be the casethe presidents commentary on deficits though that is contained in this budget blueprint is that he wanted to accomplish all of the things i just laid out regarding defense immigration law enforcement va benefits and education without adding to the deficit all right in previous administrations what they would do is they would lay out their priorities and all that money would be borrowed and they would increase the deficit whatever the deficit happened to be that year would go up by that presidents priorities thats not the case hereyes sirq  can you walk us through the  percent reduction at the state departmentdirector mulvaney no we can go through it tomorrow i mentioned that number because i think there was some numbers that were leaked that were different than that and i make that point to say that they werent accurate i will say this john which is that we believe that we have protected the core diplomatic function of state and thats why i say this is not a reflection of the presidents policies regarding an attitude towards state the president believes very strongly in what mr tillerson is doing and i think mr tillerson has already had at least one dramatic success since hes been here in the agreements he reached with iraq what you see in the state department budget is the reflection of the reductions in the foreign aid programs you have a followup on thatq  yes can you give us some other idea of percentage reductions across some of the other agenciesdirector mulvaney no because i cant remember them off the top of my head i know the defense department was up ten i believe that homeland was up six and i cannot remember  and a lot of them were in the ten to twelve range but again i dont remember the list off the top of my headyes sirq  on the epa my understanding is that  percent cut roughly     proposed  billion about  jobs scott pruitt did not quarrel with those figures at a macro level there were a couple of disagreements on environmental cleanup that basically said yes were happy with this the inaudible internally now there are discussions about making even deeper cuts to the epa could you talk a little bit about thatdirector mulvaney a couple things yeah we absolutely believe again as with state that the core functions of the epa can be satisfied  in fact beyond the core functions can be satisfied with this budget weve worked very closely with mr pruitt hes done a tremendous job to try and prioritize things over at the epa and we worked with him on those priorities regarding job reductions you mentioned  people i will tell you the same thing that i told mr pruitt and told the other agencies which is we will work with you  which is a different process this year ordinarily a presidents budget will come and say you were going to spend this amount of money and you were going to take the reductions over there and thats not how that this president worked we did set the topline numbers worked with some of the agencies on adjusting some of those numbers as they saw fit but we have given them a tremendous amount of flexibility within their own agencies this year so i cant  i wouldnt comment on the number of proposed job reductions because ultimately it will fall to mr pruitt to how to implement those topline numbers q  and thats the point ive been told but what i want to understand is how much more aggressive a topline level are you discussing in terms of  right now its at about that billionlevel how much more aggressive director mulvaney i cant remember the lineitem reduction of the epa and i dont have the document in front of melet me go in the back and then ill come back and i understand people on the phone cant ask questionsq  can i just ask what exactly are we going to see tomorrow are we going to see agencylevel funding will there be any fiscal year  numbers and will there be a supplemental for thisdirector mulvaney so three questions is one questionq  yes laughter director mulvaney thats okay q  what are we going to see tomorrowdirector mulvaney all right the question is what are we going to see tomorrow and then ill go ahead and answer the  budget and then what was your other oneq  supplementaldirector mulvaney supplemental okay thank you very much all right what are you going to see tomorrow youre going to see the actual budget blueprint which will hit the highlights it will show you the total funding for the agency and there will be bullet points on each one as to where we might have plusup spending and also details on where weve lowered spending you will not see a q  for each department and agencydirector mulvaney you will not a see a spreadsheet that goes line by line to the budget again thats up to the agencies to implement fy will be rolled out at the same time so well be talking about that i met with senate appropriators over the course of the last couple weeks i met with several of the house appropriators yesterday and we will be rolling out  thursday as well what day of the week is it folksq  wednesdaydirector mulvaney is it wednesday so when i say thursday what i mean is tomorrow laughter more importantly the day before st patricks day which is all that really counts regarding the supplemental  yes part of our  request will include a supplemental request   billion for defense and primarily border that includes  billion for the wall this year there will be money in the fy money for a wall as well as you can possibly imagine and the  proposals that we have sort of dovetail into the  so by the same token theres also proposed reductions in  so if you took sort of  and compressed it into a little version of  which youll see in  follows the same sort of general outline more spending on defense more spending on border enforcement some other line items and also reductions elsewhere and money for the wallyes maam i told you id come back thereq  can you speak to how you try to balance policy the president also talked about projecting strength in the world so if you have this dramatic reduction at state and sometimes foreign aid is used to try to bring stability to parts of the world that could be a threat how did you find that balance so that  percent which sounds so substantial where are you comfortable with the potential risk of reducing that aiddirector mulvaney sure theres no question this is a hardpower budget it is not a softpower budget this is a hardpower budget and that was done intentionally the president very clearly wants to send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong power administration so you have seen money move from softpower programs such as foreign aid into more hardpower programs thats what our allies can expect thats what our adversaries can expect thats what the president wanted us to relay and i think weve done an effective job of thatq  is he inaudibledirector mulvaney i implement the presidents policies the president decides what he wants to do and we put it into practice and thats what this budget doesyes sirq  sir you talked about the budget being an america first budget and taking what the president campaigned on on the trail and turning that into budgetary policy and one agency you havent mentioned is hud but we understand theres going to be some significant cuts in hud as well can you just explain how the presidents promise on the campaign trail to fix the inner cities and rebuild a lot of those communities fits with cutting grant programs and other housing programsdirector mulvaney sure a couple different answers to that first off one of the other things the president said was he was going to go after wasteful programs duplicative programs programs that simply dont work and a lot of those are in hud weve spent a lot of money on housing and urban development over the last decades without a lot to show for it certainly there are some successes but theres a lot of programs that simply cannot justify their existence and thats where we zeroed into the larger issue about how do you want to work with the inner cities a lot of the other presidents policies  education for example  speak to his work that he wants to see done in the inner cities plus dont discount  by the way this is a larger point  dont discount the infrastructure program as well you will see reductions for example in other agencies on infrastructure programs and people might say well goodness gracious that doesnt line up with what the president said about a commitment to infrastructure that was done intentionally the department of transportation youll see some lineitem reductions for infrastructure programs why because we believe those programs to be less efficient than the infrastructure package that were working on for later on this year so what weve effectively done is try to move money out of existing more inefficient programs and hold that money for what we expect to be more efficient infrastructure programs later onq  are you then funding any new programs that the president thinks are going to be more efficient or better or changed director mulvaney we moved money around in hud but i dont think we created any new programs again i talked to secretary carson and he has the flexibility to move money around so i would think that  secretary carson came to us came to the president more specifically and said look you gave me this pot of money i want to move money out of this existing program into this new idea i have he would have a tremendous flexibility to do that in fact thats why president trump appointed him and everybody else to those types of positionsyes sir in the backq  you said  billion for the wall is that the first step given that this director mulvaney yeah its all that we think that we can spend this year we havent settled on a  and the next question is going to be how many miles of wall does that build right and we dont know the answer to that question because we havent settled on construction types we havent settled on where were going to start i think the funding provides for a couple of different pilot cases i dont know what else to describe them  as different kinds of barriers in different kinds of places as we try and find the most costefficient the safest and also the most effective border protections they may be different in different areasso the  billion allows us to start that program we come along with additional funding   billion in   and obviously when we get to that fuller budget  the fuller budget thats not a very good word  when we get to the full budget in may youll also start seeing some projections out in throughout the year windowyes sirq  so all of your increases are offset on the other side does it add up or are you making extra room for tax cuts in theredirector mulvaney no sir this is apples to apples this is discretionary budget only so if we spend an extra dollar on a discretionary program within this blueprint we reduced a dollar within discretionary someplace else in the blueprint we have not gone to tax policy we have not gone to mandatory spending we have not gone outside of that wedge you all have seen the graph about the  trillion we spend a trillion dollars of it is discretionary funding this blueprint stays entirely within those lanesq  so you get the money for tax cuts solely out of the repeal and replace of obamacare or whatdirector mulvaney well i mean again were not addressing  this is not a tax policy document this is a discretionary spending budget that may be a question better asked once we start formulating specific details on tax policy yes maamq  where is the money for the wall coming fromdirector mulvaney from the general treasuryq  okay so you cant give us any specifics on what programs its moving out ofdirector mulvaney oh no its not  im sorry thats okay thats a fair question the question is where is the money from the wall coming from and i thought you were asking me if it was coming from mexico and its coming out of the treasury laughter no we did not say okay we need  billion for the wall lets go over and reduce this program over at education and move that  billion over to the wall we dealt with it more holistically we plussedup the various items ive talked about and then we went looking for the most inefficient most wasteful most indefensible programs in other areas so you couldnt follow it dollar for dollar but when you put it all together in a whole they offset dollar for dollaryes maamq  two questions one the federal workforce in general  can you talk about any numbers in terms of reductionsdirector mulvaney no because its going to up to  theres a great deal of discretion more so than is typical for the various agency secretariesq  okay and second question theres been some leaks about coast guard reductions and i just wondered if thats true how that squares with border security because obviously that also helpsdirector mulvaney regarding the department of homeland security budget as i think i mentioned earlier the dhs budget i think is increased about  percent there was a leak i think about a discontinuation or a proposed discontinuation of a coast guard cutter that wasnt  thats not accurate so dhs actually has a  percent increaseyes sirq  is the coast guard being reduced overalldirector mulvaney again its sort of hard to say because the department of homeland  is it a secretary or is it a director i cant remember its secretary thanks im sort of new at this  will have discretion as to how he wants to  general kelly will have  secretary kelly will have the discretion as to how he wants to allocatein the back with the computer yes sirq  in the presidents address to congress two of the sort of grander things he touched on were both curing diseases and exploring other planets so with that in mind what are nih and nasa potentially looking at in this budget and then second question does anything in this budget assume the passage of the ahcadirector mulvaney to the last question no the question is does this budget assume passage of the affordable care act there may be some places that are sort of ancillary to the aca where we went in and pulled them but generally speaking the answer is no that would be reflected in the larger budget that we do in mayregarding curing diseases and exploring other planets the overall nasa budget i think is reduced by a very small number i think its  percent is that right one percent but a lot of the programs within there are actually increased in order to align with the presidents priorities and that includes some of the exploring other planets i think we changed one of the missions to a moon at saturn or jupiter but i cant remember the details on that but the general response is yes to the extent it was consistent with what the president wanted us to do and space exploration is part of his priorities those programs actually are increased within the nasa budget which is reduced by a very small amount at the topline number   percent last time curing diseases  i thought that was a tremendous part of the speech its something ive talked about for the last couple years when i was in the house the young woman who was there has what we call an orphan disease which is a disease that not that many people have and but for federal funding that research for those diseases will not take place theres not enough people who have that disease in order to encourage the free market to develop a cure because if they did not enough people can buy it and our budget preserves the ability to do exactly thatyes sirq  when you say that anyone who seriously looks at the budget knows you cant balance it without going after entitlement programs director mulvaney going after is not the word i would use but go aheadq  fair enough okay without dealing with entitlement programs is that  obviously the president has promised not to make changes in social security and medicare so are you saying hes not going to balance the budget or are you saying once you explain the budget to him hes going to change his position on thosedirector mulvaney what ive said and i think ive said a couple times is that the fy will not balance okay we are looking at a  billion q  im talking about director mulvaney its way too early and really im not trying to dodge your question but weve been focusing on this we will not know where we are within that year budget window which is that traditional sort of perspective we put it in when we talk about a house budget or a senate budget or an executive budget we look at the year window were not ready yet to start talking about that that will be contained in the may documentq  but do you anticipate that you are going to be able to  and others are going to be able to persuade him to change his position on those thing which is what the speaker has saiddirector mulvaney i can confirm for you the president is going to keep the promises he kept regarding those programsyes sir you had a questionq  one is a rather narrow and the other is pretty broad the narrow question is are you guys going to zero out funding for the corporation of public broadcastingdirector mulvaney yesq  zero outdirector mulvaney no im sorry i was too quick with that no we propose ending funding but technically what youll see  is that one of the  million ones i think it is corporation of public broadcasting yes its  youll see its an elimination but youll see an amount of money in that budget and that is for  it is actually a sum amount of money thats necessary for us to unwind our involvement with the cpb so you wont see a zero next to it but the policy is that were ending federal involvement with the corporation for public broadcastingq  over a period of yearsdirector mulvaney well this year q  this yeardirector mulvaney probably next year you might see it be zero but it may take a while to unwind that relationship its just the nature of contracts and so forthyou had a more general commentq  the broad question was there was a piece in the paper this week that suggested that were in for the largest reduction of proposed reduction of the federal workforce since world war ii can you speak to the concerns in this area about the impact on property values and the washington receptiondirector mulvaney i work for the president of the united states the president of the united states he represents the district of columbia northern virginia and southern maryland but he also represents the rest of the country and i can assure you that we did not write this budget with an eye towards what it would do to the value of your condo laughter yes maam q  or trump properties im sure you mean in there too when it comes to  im trying to get my hands around when you emphasized foreign aid cut to emphasize that phrase there are some softpower things the state department does that are in concert with dod like military training programs or food aid that us marines go out and deliver are you essentially moving those things from state to dod or are these just hard cuts to entire programsdirector mulvaney let me see if i can answer it this way its a technical answer and im not sure it will satisfy you but this is how we look at it in the budget world the  function which is what we call defense  theres a line item in the budget which is   that goes well beyond just the department of defense there are defenserelated functions in many agencies the easiest example to think of  and this is actually applicable to this years blueprint  is inside the department of energy is a  section for the nuclear arsenal the  is what got plussedup  billion so its not just within the pentagon in fact we did increase the  spending at the department of energy for the nuclear triad so to the extent your question is are  functions within the state department part of the increase the answer is yes but i cant speak to where individual programs fall in terms of whether or not theyre  or notq  so when you are emphasizing foreign aid you are not including those programs can you explain what you mean you think youre cutting or is that all up to tillerson to decidedirector mulvaney when you see the blueprint we identify the specific names and i dont want to get lazy and i dont want to be sloppy with which programs are identified but youll see specific programs within the state department budget that we do reduce and that may answer your questionq  a clarification twentyeight percent reduction at state is that across state or just director mulvaney yes sir thats across stateq  the state reduction do you have a dollar figure on that and is state the largest dollarfigure reduction by any agency what gets you the farthest along to the  billiondirector mulvaney i cant remember and i honestly dont want to guess in terms of either the percentage or the dollar figure and i apologize  again i just dont  that will be readily knowable to you in the document tomorrow and i dont want to misspeakyes maam for the last oneq  i just wanted to ask you a little bit more about the epa cuts and specifically enforcing the paris climate change agreement obviously the president has said he doesnt support that what cuts would impact enforcement on that i mean because that goes to the clean power plan that goes to cafe standards and i know theres going to be an announcement today and then of course theres the green climate fund that the president  the last president committed to fund and i dont know if that was going through epa i think it was going through appropriations but would that be cut as part of this budget movementdirector mulvaney i dont want to speak to specific line items in there because again i dont want to misspeak but ill answer your question this way which is that you can expect reductions in the epa that dont line up with the presidents view on things like global warming and alternative energies so you will see a reduction in subsidies a reduction in participation and those types of programs i wont speak specifically to the paris accords because i dont know off the top of my head what that involves in terms of the line items in the budget but to the extent there are reductions at epa and they are and they are significant you could expect that that would be one of the places where we focused heavilylook im going to stop this because quite frankly my mouth is dry and i need a glass of water  laughter  but i dont want a marco rubio but ill be coming back again to do this tomorrow at q  youll join seandirector mulvaney at  oclock its sean and then by then youll have that chance to look at the blueprint and ask specific questionsthank you all very muchend am edt

is goodmr spicer all right then were ready to goq  ready to gomr spicer good afternoon everyone i hope you all had a great weekend the president spent his weekend in a series of meetings with white house staff and advisors planning for a full and productive week on saturday as many of you saw the president had a working lunch with several members of his team including homeland security kelly treasury secretary mnuchin commerce secretary ross veterans secretary shulkin and members of his white house staff during which they discussed immigration reform and their efforts to repeal and replace obamacareover the weekend the vice president went down to louisville kentucky he was joined by governor matt bevin for a listening session with over a dozen smallbusiness owners from kentucky to discuss the burdens that obamacare has inflicted on their businesses the kentucky business owners shared in detail how obamacare is negatively affecting their businesses and reiterated their support for repealing our current healthcare system and replacing with one that actually worksthis morning after receiving his intelligence briefing the president led another listening session on healthcare with secretary of health and human services dr tom price the president and secretary price heard from nine concerned americans from across the country who have been failed by the broken promises of obamacare as well as two doctors who have seen their patients suffer from the laws misguided rules and requirementsthis listening session was another important step in the process of crafting and implementing an effective patientcentered healthcare americans have been watching their healthcare costs skyrocket while their choices of providers and insurers have dwindled for years theyve received those cancellations in the mail as many as three times theyve seen urgent care and emergency rooms filled with people who cant afford their high deductibles and resorted to enduring the pain or sickness until they had no choice but to go to a hospital theyve had family members with chronic preexisting conditions whose cost of healthcare has more than doubled and theyve been forced to let go of valued employees or frankly unable to hire more due to staggering workers compensation increasesthe president campaigned on a pledge to repeal and replace this unraveling system the american health care act is one part of fulfilling this pledge its far from the only one hes using administrative action to provide essential regulatory relief to insurers increasing coverage choices and providing lowerpremium options to individuals and familieshe will continue to work with congress on the additional legislation part of this threeprong strategy to increase choice while decreasing prices including allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines adding to the list of healthcarerelated costs patients conduct with their health savings accounts streamlining the process at the fda so that lowerpriced generic medicine gets to the market faster inviting small business to band together to negotiate for lower health insurance for all their employees and reforming the medical malpractice lawsuit system so that doctors are not forced to perform unnecessary and costly procedures and tests out of fear of future litigation our healthcare system is large complex and critically important not only to the health of our citizens but to the health of our economy through commonsense patientfocused reforms the president will work with congress to create a new system that doesnt impose a onesizefitsall governmentknowsbest vision on the american people we will empower the american people to make their own choices about healthcare that make them best work for themselves and their family that will bring costs for everyone down after the listening session the president had lunch with vice president pence and secretary of transportation chao later this afternoon the president will welcome all of his confirmed cabinet members to the white house for their first cabinet meeting this meeting is an important opportunity for the president to share his vision with the country with his cabinet members providing direction for them to bring back to their agencies and departments to ensure that the entire administration is working towards the same goalsunfortunately this afternoon youll see some empty chairs around the table representing the presidents four nominees who have yet to be confirmed by the senate  secretary of agriculturedesignee

absence will clearly be felt as this administration comes together for the first time to receive guidance from and provide counsel to the president on these unique areas of jurisdictionfollowing the cabinet meeting the president will sign an executive order to reorganize the federal government this order requires a thorough examination of every executive department and agency to identify money

asked to resign like the other attorneys and then he says he was fired on saturday when he refused to resign did the president change his mind about keeping him on or was it only supposed to be for a finite period of time can you just fill us inmr spicer im going to refer you to the department of justice on that this is a standard operating procedure for a new administration around this time to ask for the resignation of all the us attorneys we had most of them  or a good chunk of them had already submitted their resignation letter this is just the final swath of individuals who had not at this time but this is common practice of most administrationsq  i understand that this happened at the doj and the request was from the doj but there seems to a white house connection visvis the fact that the president had actually asked him to stay on and then the president apparently called him a couple of days before he was allegedly fired can you tell us what that was all about and did the president change his mindmr spicer no the president was calling to thank him for his service this is as i said a standard action that takes place at most administrations thenattorney general reno sent out an almost identical letter in  the bush administration sent out a similar one as well so this is a very common practice for all political appointees  not just in the department of justice  but throughout government when theres a turnover administration to ask for all individuals to do thatmajorq  sean yesterday john mccain said the president should either provide information about the allegation he put on twitter a week ago saturday about his phones being tapped at trump tower or retract his statement today is the deadline whats the president going to domr spicer well lets be clear  the department of justice was asked to send information down to congress it wasnt the white house that was asked to do that just so were clear as far as what the request wasq  but the tweet came from the president of the united statesmr spicer i understand that and with the tweet q  does he have an obligation as senator mccain said to clear this upmr spicer and i think if you look at the presidents tweet he said very clearly wiretapping in quotes theres been substantial discussion in several reports that bret baier from fox on march rd talked about evidence of wiretapping theres been reports in the new york times and the bbc and other outlets about other aspects of surveillance that have occurredthe president was very clear in his tweet that it was wiretapping that that spans a whole host of surveillance types of options the house and the senate intelligence committees will now look into that and provide a report back but i think that there has been numerous reports from a variety of outlets over the last couple months that seem to indicate that there has been different types of surveillance that occurred during the  election q  and so what youre saying is the president doesnt have an obligation to provide any evidencemr spicer no im not saying that at all not at all what im saying is the request that was made from the house was to the department of justice i think that thats an appropriate question to ask themwhat im telling you is from a white house perspective theres no question that there have been an abundance of reports regarding surveillance and other type of activities that occurred during the  electionq  and that leads us to believe that the presidents only evidence are these reportsmr spicer no no that leads you to believe that im saying to you q  im trying to mr spicer and im saying to you is that what we made clear on that sunday was that the house and senate intelligence committees have the means the process and the access to go in and look at the entirety of the evidence thats being presented to them and make a determination that they can report back to usq  thanks sean following up on majors question does the president feel he has an obligation once the investigation is over to release some sort of statement in response to whatever the findings are thats my first question i have a second one for you mr spicer well lets get there first i think to start to presume what the outcome is going to be before the house and the senate look at all of the evidence and information and reports that are presented to them would be a bit presumptuous so i think  lets slow down a little let them look at everything and then let them make some determinationsq  and then my second question for you has president trump donated his paycheck from the month of february like he promised to do during the campaignmr spicer the presidents intention right now is to donate his salary at the end of the year and he has kindly asked that you all help determine where that goes the way that we can avoid scrutiny is to let the press corps determine where it should go laughter q  oh we have a few ideasmr spicer in all seriousness i think his view is he made a pledge to the american people he wants to donate it to charity and hed love your help to determine where it should goq  may i suggest the correspondents association mr spicer that will be a great way q  journalism scholarshipmr spicer that would be a great way to do it q  thanks a lot sean i wanted to follow up with you on questions regarding michael flynn whos no longer in the administration theres a fiveyear lobbying ban thats been imposed upon all trump administration employees does that also apply to michael flynn would he not be permitted to lobby now for five years because of the agreement that he signed when he became the national security advisormr spicer that would be correct id have to check and actually figure out when he signed or if he signed the form but yes all administration officials who come in are required to sign that ethics pledge banning them from lobbying for five years and then a lifetime ban on lobbying on behalf of any foreign governmentq  and then related to that what are the repercussions if an employee of this administration lobbies within five years wheres the teeth whats the penalty whats the punishment that would be imposed on that particular trump administration employeemr spicer id have to get back to you john i dont know whether thats a department of justice aspect or not but i will get backyeahq  i was wondering did the president ask preet bharara to stay on during their conversation during the transition or notmr spicer i was not privy to that conversation again im not really sure how its relevant at the end of the day the department of justice asked all remaining  at this time that they asked for all of them to submit their letters of resignation based on the same kind of precedent that was set during both the clinton and then the bush administrations in terms of the timeline and format jessicaq  i just wanted to ask about the reports about president xi jinping visiting maralago april th and th can you confirm that visit and talk about what you want to accomplish with that type of less formal visit and secondly with respect to that visit you still dont have a confirmed ambassador you dont have an assistant secretary of state for east asia affairs house ow does that affect your planning and ability to really properly brief the president and make sure he has a strong positionmr spicer planning is ongoing for a visit between president trump and president xi at a date to be determined were not ready to confirm that and we will have more details its the purpose of this meeting of that kind of a meeting to help defuse tensions over north korea and the recent deployment of a thaad military battery to south korea any meeting between the president of the united states and the peoples republic of china would necessarily cover a broad range of topics of mutual concernsecretary tillerson is traveling to the region now so i think as we go forward we will have additional details on both the timing and the location of that when we go forwardq  is the implication of you saying tillerson is traveling that hes setting up the visit seanmr spicer im sorryq  is the implication of you talking about tillersons visit that hes going to be laying the groundwork for mr spicer well hes in the region im sure that in his visit to japan south korea and then china that preparations will come up as well as areas of mutual concernq  sean theres been a rash of  mr spicer whats thatq  is it memr spicer sure lets go one at a timeq  theres been a rash of attacks on lgbt community centers throughout the nation over the weekend the community center here in dc casa ruby was attacked and a transgender staffer was assaulted this follows similar attacks that have taken place in recent days in orlando florida new jersey and oklahoma this is not unlike the antisemitism that the president has already denounced will the president also denounce these attacksmr spicer sure i mean i think that  i think one of the points that weve made in previous statements on this is that this is not the way that we as americans solve our differences we dont attack each other we dont engage in this kind of behavior i think we have a first amendment that allows us to express ourselves and thats the appropriate way but doing it when youre threatening violence or destruction or vandalism is inappropriate in all of its formsq  is it connected to the withdrawal of the transgender guidance do you thinkmr spicer is it whatq  is it at all connected mr spicer i dont believe there is any connection between  i think that that would be a stretch to say the leastyes maamq  thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask about north korea you mentioned north korea can you tell us a little bit about the review of north korea right now and what direction you think the administration is going in terms of the relationship  trying to manage the threat from north koreamr spicer as i mentioned secretary tillerson is heading to the region hell meet with his counterparts in south korea japan and then ultimately in beijing thats obviously going to be a major subject and as i mentioned when we ultimately meet with president xi and others that will be a discussion its something thats hes talked about prior to the resignation of the last south korean president and was something that has been part of an ongoing discussionso theres an internal review that we continue to have but then theres obviously a geopolitical conversation were having with partners in the region as we look to contain north koreas military threatq  thank you sean can you confirm that any cooperation with russia with regard to syria is off the table and if not is it fair to say that the forthcoming antiisis plan does include some sort of cooperation with russiamr spicer im not going to get into what the plan  i mean the plan is not done yet as i mentioned a couple days ago secretary mattis was briefing the principals and that plan is continuing to evolve so im not going to start to rule out one country but i think the president has been very clear in the past that if a country shares our commitment to defeating isis and we can work with them in an area of shared mutual concern then we will do soq  second question a kremlin spokesperson said that russian president putin and president trump will meet at the g can you confirm that and would the white house move on a possibility of a meeting before thatmr spicer i will follow up on that i dont have a date i know that the team is working very actively with respect to bilateral meetings at the g i dont have anything for you on thatrobertaq  director mulvaney said yesterday that he felt that the obama administration had been manipulating the unemployment rate im wondering if thats a view that the president shares and what evidence is there of mr spicer i think he was clearly referring to obamacare the number of people but i would refer you back to him and his comments with respect to how he characterized that i think he can discuss the precise nature of what he meant on thatq  does the president feel that the obama administration had been manipulating mr spicer i think you know what the presidents view is hes made very clear in the past what his comments were on how those numbers were articulated in the past and i think theres a question between the total number of people that are employed and the presidents comments in the past have reflected that his big concern was getting to the bottom of how many people are working in this country and that the denominator  meaning the percentage rate of the total number of people  is not the most accurate reflection of how many people are employed in this country how many jobs are created how many people are getting back to work how many companies are committing to hiring more people is a much more accurate assessment of where were headed as our country  where our employment is where our economy is headedbut to look at a number and say we have  or  or  percent unemployment is not necessarily an accurate reflection of how many people are actually working seeking work or want to work and if you know how they conduct those surveys theres a lot of times when people whether theyre older or younger or because of how long theyve been searching for work are not considered statistically viable anymore and theyre washed awayso i think how you look at the percentage of people working can sometimes be a manipulated number the number of people that are added to the roll every year  every month rather  is a much more accurate understanding of whats happening in the economyceciliaq  i just want to clarify your answer to majors question so will the doj andor the administration comply with the deadline to supply information todaymr spicer remember its the  again its not  the request was made of the doj and so the proper venue to ask that question of is the department of justiceq  but surely the white house knows whether there is or there is not evidence mr spicer you cant  because its interesting in the past whenever weve had these conversations with another agency the accusation from the press corps is that were interfering in something so you cant have it both ways you cant say that were interfering with someone when we talk to them when we dont talk to them its surely you must know so q  so if the president tweets something mr spicer hold on cecilia is asking a questionq   and then say its the department justices obligation q  this is to follow up on mr spicer i understand that i saw the ticktock i understand it that doesnt mean you get to jump inceciliaq  so to follow up on majors point though this is a tweet from the president doesnt the president have an obligation mr spicer and he does and i think weve made it very q   to make the evidence clearmr spicer right and weve made it very clear that we expect the house and the senate intelligence committees to do their job i think theres a preponderance of reports that continues to come out about surveillance and actions that have occurred during the  election once they come up with their report  and it was asked earlier today  i think we can talk about the conclusions of that report but at this time you cant say that were going to shift it off to the house and senate and then comment every day that was the entire goal of asking them to look into this furtherq  but will doj comply with this deadline today the clock is tickingq  the president instructed them mr spicer i understand my understanding is that they will but again i would ask them what their intention is and i believe there are certain things that they can and cant do in terms of classification and stuff but i would leave it up to the department of justice to answer for the department of justicekaitlan q  how is the press making obamacare look goodmr spicer well i think when you see some of these comparisons that occur in the  talk about whos going to win and whos going to lose it misses a lot of the competition thats going to take place it doesnt talk about the increased choiceright now as the president has noted as secretary price has noted in a third of all counties in five states you have one choice those analyses that are very  trying to look at how much youll pay and how much you wont a dont take into consideration the competition thats going to occur the choice thats going to occur i mean right now you have one choice in a lot of places you have no decision about how much youre going to pay and what youre going to get choice allows you to determine what scale of healthcare you need what kind of package is good for you your family or for your business and when you look at a lot of these analyses when you open up various major papers they make it seem so simple its how much are you going to pay for on this plan how much are you going to pay for under the current plan it misses an entirety of the whole process which is that you dont have competition number onenumber two and the bigger point that i think the president and a lot of others are getting to is that the system is failing on its own it makes it seem like its all rainbows and puppies at the end of the day if you have a card and youre getting a subsidy but youre not getting care you have nothingand so walking into a doctors office where you can hand them a card and say ive got a  tax subsidy  if that doctor doesnt take the care or the deductible is so high then you really dont have anything and so to do an applestoapples comparison is hardly an accurate analysis of what the current situation iszekeq  just going back to the counterisis plan you mentioned earlier the plan isnt dont yet the president during the campaign said multiple times that within  days he wanted that plan presented to him obviously its undergoing comments at the national security council principals level but is the president upset that he hasnt received it yet and does that point to a difference between campaigning and governing that things take longer than he thoughtmr spicer no i think theres a difference the plan has been received right the issue as you correctly point out in your question is that now that it becomes an aspect of the principals all discussing different priorities different staffing levels different funding levels but the plan is here as we noted a few weeks ago its being reviewed and theyre providing input from different members of the principals and different members of his national security apparatus to make sure that the plan continues to evolve and is able to attack isis in a way that q  when is it actually going to take effectmr spicer some pieces of it are in the sense of  he has talked to commanders on the ground weve noted before some of the military action thats been taken some of the authority thats been given to some of the commanders on the ground that is actually taking the fight to isis on a daily basis i think the more holistic approach that he asked for will continue to evolve through the national security process but make no mistake were on it right nowsharonq  thanks sean on the executive order this afternoon do you have a numeric goal for either reducing the size of government or saving a certain amount of money through the review of agenciesmr spicer i dont know that director mulvaney has a target per se i think thats part of the issue is that you go through each one of these and you evaluate them on the merit of what they do or dont do or whether or not theyve become bloated or duplicative or frankly just outdated or in need of technological advancesbut theres a lot of  theres no set number that were driving down to as we review government sometimes you just walk into an agency and you realize that agencys mission is no longer relevant or that its duplicative in three other agencies or that there are too many people performing a function that no longer exists for a variety of reasons but thats why the mission is critical that director mulvaney was given the mandate to go out and get all of these different agencies and departments to review themselves and to provide feedback for him as to where we could gogabiq  thanks sean you had said previously that the republican healthcare plan wouldnt be a onesizefitsall approach but the current plan preserves obamacares health benefits requirements which literally defines insurance at the federal level so how do you reconcile those two thingsmr spicer whats missing right now is choice thats the numberone issue we tried to solve a problem  when i say we the government  with respect to obamacare back in   and the issue was is that in order to solve a problem for several million people being without healthcare insurance we upended the system for everybody  so if you had employerbased healthcare if you had tricare medicare or medicaid and it was exactly the opposite approach we went in to solve a problem that a small fraction of americans had and we upended the entire system forcing premiums to go up and choice to go down for everybody and i think that when you can institute choice and competition back in the system thats something thats going to benefit everybody and thats exactly the opposite of whats happeningq  would phase two or three of this eliminate those requirementsmr spicer i think phase two the administrative phase will look at a lot of those requirements and then phase three  and again theyre not necessarily  they can run concurrently and i think the house is looking at starting a lot of that legislationand so  and dr price is already starting to look through a lot of that administration  a lot of administrative aspects of it as well at hhs and figure out how do we start to achieve some of this unravel some of these pieces that are there but instilling choice and competition allowing people to buy their insurance over state lines allowing small businesses to pool allowing the expansion of health savings accounts  all of those kind of factors that are going to drive down costs but also having the insurance companies frankly be able to offer additional choices and options for people is in itself going to be a huge bonuscharlieq  a lot of conservatives are complaining that  or suggesting that the president doesnt fully back the paul ryan healthcare plan has the president spoken with paul ryan about the plan and have they had any conversations about its future in congressmr spicer they have spoken yes i dont know when the last time they have but the president is fully committed to this plan i think you saw secretary price and director mulvaney out discussing that this weekend theyre committed to the planand look director mulvaney made it very clear this weekend as well that if through the process we can find some ideas that make this a stronger more patientcentered piece of legislation that will ultimately benefit americans then were going to do it were not saying this is the only way forward as it works its way through the house and then ultimately through the senate if there are ways that we can enhance the bill through the legislative process were willing to do thatpeterq  you want to read us another  quickly  if theres any details of the mr spicer would you like to know laughterq  yesmr spicer okay thank you the president spoke to the chancellor of germany they agreed due to the current weather that the meeting should be postponed the meeting has been rescheduled to march th this friday same schedule of events on march th q  all right ill ask my question if i can very quickly then mr spicer thank you for your assistance with the q  thats news you spoke on behalf of the president quoting him on the jobs report on friday you said they may have been phony in the past but its very real now mr spicer they are very real nowq  they are very real nowmr spicer just want to make sure you get it right q  the question i wanted  when should americans trust the president should they trust the president  is it phony or real when he says that president obama was wiretapping himmr spicer well again lets get back i think theres two things that are important about what he said i think recognizing that its  he doesnt really think that president obama went up and tapped his phone personallyq  what does he thinkmr spicer but i think theres no question that the obama administration that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the  election that is a widely reported activity that occurred back then the president used the word wiretap to mean broadly surveillance and other activities during that and that is again something  it is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the  election cycle and now were wondering where the proof is it is many of the same outlets in this room that talked about the activities that were going on back thenq  so on the same topic on the cbo report did the president think it was real then and is phony nowmr spicer what cbo reportq  on the expectation  the cbo report is coming out about which you said if youre looking at the cbo for accuracy youre looking in the wrong place three years ago you said of the cbo report that it confirms obamacare is bad for the economy so the question is mr spicer well it was bad for the economyq  okay so the bottom line of the question is was it real then and now is now phony as you have said its not the place to find accuracymr spicer okay so lets look at the cbos projection it said their projection on obamacare was that in  it would have  million people on it the actual figure is  million people  less than half the number of people that it predicted would be insured were on it and its decliningso the only point peter is to make sure that people understand  if youre looking to get a bullseye accurate prediction as to where its going the cbo was off by more than half last time so its not  this is not about what my understanding or my belief of the cbo is the last time they did this they were wildly off and the number keeps declining and so the question that needs to get asked right now or frankly the awareness that needs to be brought up right now is that if you were going to look at a number tonight i think you have to look through the scope of whether or not that number isnow it was bad for the economy that was right you can glean that in terms of the direction what the impact that it had but as far as their numbers go  on the number of people that they predicted back then would be covered now  they were off by more than halfq  i guess the question is when can we trust the president when he says something is phony and when he says its realmr spicer hold on hold on you asked a question about cbo and now youre conflating it with the question of the president the question is q  no i asked a question about wiretapping first and then we went on to cbo so the question in simple terms is when he says something can we trust that its real mr spicer yesq   or should we assume that its phony well no no mr spicer you suggest that its real absolutelyq  how can we believe that its real when you just told us that it was phony then but now its realmr spicer i did not tell you that peter and youre trying q  you told us on friday that the president said  the president you didnt  the president said the numbers were phony then but theyre very real now so how can we take anything he says that he wont later say actually it was the oppositemr spicer hold on hold on i think the difference is the president was talking then and now about job creation  the number of jobs the issue that he brought up in the quote that youre talking about was the percentage of people who are unemployed and there is no question that no matter how you look at this whether you talk about  or  or whatever the number is that number fluctuates by how people calculate who is in the workforceq  he said it was in the twenties or more mr spicer okay peter let me answer the questionq  im listeningmr spicer youre not let me answer it the bottom line is the percentage of people who are unemployed varies widely by who youre asking and the way you do the analysis of who is actually in the workforce the number of people who are working and receiving a paycheck is a number that we can look atsecondly when youre asking about the validity of the cbo report again i would refer you to the cbo itself the number that they issued that would be insured in  was  million people the actual number is   excuse me  million the actual number is  thats not a question of our credibility its a question of theirsdo you have anything more laughterq  the bottom line is the question that you still have not answered is mr spicer i have answered itq   can you say affirmatively that whenever the president says something we can trust it to be realmr spicer if hes not joking of course but in that case q  so lets start over again with jokingmr spicer but youre asking  hold on  okay no no but your point is  i mean every time that he speaks authoritatively  that he speaks  that he is speaking as president of the united states like its q  three to five  more than  million americans voted illegally  was that when he was speaking mr spicer yes and he still believes thatq   was he joking or does he believe itmr spicer he does believe it thank youjulieq  thanks sean i have a healthcare question but first can we just get an answer one way or the other about whether the president directed the department of justice to respond to thismr spicer no he did notq  and does he plan tomr spicer i answered the questionq  okay so on healthcare secretary price said on sunday that nobody will be worse off financially and more people will be covered than are currently with the plan that you guys are pushing paul ryan acknowledged that people are going to lose coverage so what is the goal here you just said youre open to modifications to the plan if you find that theres a better way to do it is the goal that people not lose coverage or is the goal that mr spicer well again  but theres a false argument there which is that they have coverage people have cards theyve been told they have things but they cant  they keep walking in  the president met with nine individuals this morning that they were told theyre going to get coverage for something they are told that theyre going to have all these subsidies they walk in and they dont get covered they dont have the care that they need there is a difference between walking around with someone and saying hey ive got a card than i have care and that is a big big difference right now when you have a third of the counties in this country that have one choice and going down and number of insurers leaving markets then the system is collapsing so the question has to be to everybody who is not with us on this is what is your alternative because right now the current system of obamacare is failing every american who has obamacare and frankly for those who dont have obamacare for those who have employerbased insurance for those who have tricare or medicare its driving up the costs and in the cases especially for those who have medicaid medicare or triceare theyre going into doctors offices more and more who are telling them we dont accept thatq  but youre talking about quality and about cost im asking about coveragemr spicer yeah but thats the point is that youre missing the point if you keep talking about coverage  care is what matters if you cant walk in and get seen if you cant get a doctor to see you then you dont have coverage i mean thats what this is all about being told you have coverage but you cant go see a doctor or you cant afford to see a doctor is not coveragejohn gizzimr spicer thank you sean i have two questions first democratic leader pelosi said on friday that every single democrat would vote against the american healthcare plan  the plan backed by republican members of congress and the administration the freedom caucus in the house has come out for senator pauls plan when one simply does the arithmetic of democratic members and freedom caucus members thats a majority against the plan how does the administration plan to overcome the arithmeticmr spicer were going to continue to work with members of the house and then eventually the senate i feel very good as the president continues to engage with members that we will have the votes necessary i think speaker ryan agrees with that as well were going to have the votes this thing will pass and well move on to the senateq  the other question is this in recent weeks theres been considerable attention on the upcoming elections in the netherlands on wednesday and in france in a few weeks candidate geert wilders of the netherlands was here for the cpac conference representatives of marine le pen of france were here many analogies were made between these candidates and president trump and they offered words of praise for him or did so through their representatives is he aware of these candidates in europe who invoke his name and image and if so what does he think of these wouldbe trumps and trumpettesmr spicer i dont know the answer to that i think most of these are  well allow sovereign nations to have their own elections without interferencealexisq  sean can i follow up on peter and julies questionsmr spicer sureq  two issues again whether the president and director mulvaney put a lot of faith in the congressional budget office members of the senate will when they get  if they get legislation from the house so my question is what does the president or the administration intend to do to establish to senators satisfaction that the numbers coming out of the congressional budget office which the president will question are not substantial and can be countered by other information in other words is omb doing its own kind of score is the president relying on a think tank to counter the messaging because senators are already indicating that they will put weight in the cbos scoremr spicer and again i think this is part of an ongoing discussion with members as far as philosophical what do they believe and a lot of these aspects of this plan in keeping with what they have supported in the pastobviously theyre going to look at the score  i get it thats part of it and there are pieces of it that may historically have more weighted than others but i think this is going to be  as i mentioned to john i mean its an ongoing conversation with members of the house and ultimately the senate with respect to whatever comes outbut in the same way that members relied on the score last time they were way off and i think that we have to remind them that if this is what youre basing your vote on you have to look at the historical context in which that information was provided i think thats an important aspect to how they do it but i think theres going to be a ton of factors that people rely on as they do thisq  can i follow  i have one followupmr spicer of courseq  i may be confused about the wiretapping your answers in terms of the presidents response the president was the one who tweeted this right and said that he learned something so can you just establish for me because im confused the president did discuss what it is that he had in mind what he tweeted with the department of justice before the department mr spicer no im not going to get into what the president knew or didnt know prior to it i think weve already commented on this multiple timesq  but how would the department of justice have any idea mr spicer i dont know this was a request made of the house intelligence committee not to us so i dont want to get into starting to parse what we knew or what we didnt that request did not come to us it went to the department of justiceyesq  congressman steve king inaudible a tweet he put up saying that we cant restore civilization with somebody elses babies does the white house have any reaction to thatmr spicer i will definitely touch base with the president on that and get back to you on thathallieq  sean two for you i just want to go back to something you just said a minute ago that what the president meant when he tweeted about the wiretapping was  and you sort of explained it but youve also stood at that podium and said the tweet speaks for itself when do you decide when a presidents tweets when his words are open to interpretation and when those words stand on their ownmr spicer im sorry can you further explain what youre asking i mean his tweets do speak for themselvesq  you just sort of interpreted it for peter saying well he didnt mean that president obama had mr spicer thats not what i said no no actually q  you said when he meant wiretapping  said it  he meant surveillance thats not what he saidmr spicer he literally had it in quotesq  so youre interpreting the tweet for us it sounds likemr spicer no in some cases ill ask him what did the quotes mean and hell say q  did you ask about this tweetmr spicer i didq  and what did he saymr spicer he said they were in quotes i was referring to surveillance overall its something that had been referred to in other reports q  so he cited other reports in his conversation with youmr spicer he did yesq  so was that what he was basing that tweet onmr spicer as i just mentioned  it was a good try but ive already been clear on thatq  i have a second for you sean i want to go back to this healthcare idea just yes or no are cbo numbers legitimate or notmr spicer thats not my determination to make im telling q  does the president think those numbers are legitimatemr spicer hallie it depends there are a lot of things at  hold on hallie you guys have like an nbc thing let me answer the question i think when you look at whatever that number is whether its budget projections or whatever i think theres a track record that goes along a lot of times with whether or not the projections in certain areas  whether its unemployment budgetary numbers whatever  what the track record isall im suggesting to you is very clearly that the numbers that they gave the last time they did health care were off by more than  percent when it came to the number of people insured thats not my interpretation thats a fact and i think its important for people to understand the differenceseamonq  sean on preet bharara i guess there are two possibilities here one is the president made a commitment to keep him back in november and the other one is that he didnt preet bharara came down to the lobby of trump tower and said that the president had made that commitment did the president in fact make that commitment to preet bhararamr spicer i dont think it really matters at the end of the day the attorney general followed a practice that existed for the last several administrations and asked every attorney general in the last administration to submit their resignation so i mean it is q  it matters in ongoing investigations and it also matters in the sense that the president made a commitment if he made a commitment why did he change his mind why did he go back on itmr spicer well again as i mentioned earlier he called him to thank him for his service last week he followed in the past practice of last several administration and asked everybody to step down and i think thats the appropriate thing q  sean but whats changed from november to nowmr spicer i called on someoneq  sean thank you ronica cleary from fox  thank you i have two questions the first i think especially in light of what has happened in the room here today the president tweeted this morning that much of the media is being rude and that we should be nice so my question is is it our job to be nice and do you think were nice laughter mr spicer  thank you ronica i will just leave it at this i think that ive been asked for my personal opinion several times thats not my job i dont get up here to speak for myself i speak for the president i think that he has been very clear that he doesnt believe some of the behavior and the reporting has been appropriate and to hallies point i will let the tweet speak for itselfronica number twoq  second question but this is about you the interaction you had at the apple store this weekend  what would be i guess your message to individuals who want to maybe  i see that woman was you could argue very aggressive if somebody doesnt want to be aggressive and has a question for you what would you be your kind of message to a regular citizen that has an issuemr spicer ask it i interact with individuals all day long ninetynine percent of them are pleasant even with people who may not agree with our philosophy or programs or whatever but its a free country and the beauty of it is that people can act how they want no matter how thats interpreted and as long as they stay on the right side of the first amendment were goodfrancescaq  thank you sean you said that when the president said wiretapping in that tweet he meant a whole host of surveillance types so that we can be crystal clear what surveillance types was he referring to then what would you consider part of that rangemr spicer well i mean i think theres a whole host of tactics that can be used to monitor somebody  either through wiretap or other ways in which you can surveil somebodyq  we took that to mean monitoring his calls specifically so what else would you include in that rangemr spicer i think theres a whole host of things that fall into that category so im not sure how you took it but there is a wide range of ways in which somebody can be monitored or followed up on and i think that if you contacted one of the law enforcement agencies they will provide you with a whole host of waysthank you all be safe tomorrow with the snow thank you very much take care stay safe end pm edt

great privilege great privilege to be back to the latino coalition once again the last time i was here i was a congressman from the great state of indiana and today i am deeply humbled to stand before you today as vice president of the united states of america applause the reason im in this position is because of the confidence of my friend the th president of the united states of america and because of the support of people like you all across this country and i want to tell you that i bring greetings from the president just before i left the oval office i told him i was headed your way and he was pleased to hear about it and i told him i was headed to a conference entitled make small business great again policy summit and he was very pleased applause i think the president wants you to know that our administration simply put  and linda will back me up on this the trump administration will be the best friend american small businesses will ever have applause the president and i know what our whole team knows is that small businesses are the engines of the american economy as president trump said in his joint address to congress last week  did everybody see that speech he said were going to restart the engine to create jobs and prosperity and growth in america like never before and its already begunyou know i grew up in a small business family in a small town in southern indiana i went to work at one of my dads gas stations when i was only  years of age had a dark blue shirt with a stripe on it had my name on it i was really proud of myself now for those of you under the age of  if youre wondering what a gas station attendant was  laughter  just imagine if when you pulled into a gas station some young person ran out with a name on their shirt pumped your gas cleaned your windshield checked your tires and didnt charge you any more money for it it was a great job a great experiencebut i grew up in a family business so i know the sacrifices all of you make and as the world knows president trump also grew up in a family business as well it was a little bit bigger than my dads by the end of the day its the same principle i was just in a meeting yesterday with the president in the cabinet room and we were talking about infrastructure with leaders and an old friend of his said that he and the president had grown up the same way he said come saturday mornings even when we were very young the time that we spent with our dad was we were out on a job site and thats what it is to be in a small business familyi told him afterwards i said you know for me it was headed to the plant or headed to the gas station with my dad and i know the small businesses that are gathered here know where of i speak and i just want to assure you that president trump and i both know the sacrifices that are required to make a small business work and most importantly we know this when small business is strong the american economy is strong and were going to fight every day to make that a reality applause now the latino coalition knows this truth  this statement better than most businesses represented in this room have made an incredible impact not just in the lives of your employees but in your communities and frankly in the nation as a whole the fact is that hispanics are driving entrepreneurship and economic growth like never before  just like hector said the number of latinoowned businesses grew by more than  percent over the past decade  leaps and bounds over every other american demographic applause and hispanic firms have also been hiring at a record pace this was clear just yesterday  i dont know if you all saw that news its just amazing we had the most jobs created in a single month in over three years  the february reports  jobs applause and hispanic businesses were a part of that successits incredible to think that today hispanics own an amazing  million american companies and their combined annual revenue is over  billion it might be a small business but thats big business where i come from and latinoowned small businesses continue to be the fastest growing sector of the entire economy now let me pause for just a second here if i can  it is womens history month could we give a round of applause to all the latina small business owners who are with us today who are charting a great great force of success in the american economy applause incredible leadership demonstrated and its great to see your peers all honor you i know the president honors you as well in this important month of celebrationbefore i move on let me just ask  could i ask all of those whove worn the uniform in the united states of america to rise  the men and women who have served their country in uniform applause the president and i just never want to fail to acknowledge the contributions of every american through our armed forces its amazing that the contribution of the hispanic community in america continues to this day  over  hispanics are serving in the army the navy the air force the marines the coast guard and the reserves at this very moment i know we asked them to stand but will the rest of you mind standing to demonstrate just how proud we are of those who serve in the armed forces in the united states and those who have served in the defense of this nation applause thank you for your service and thank you for honoring all of them you know you cant look at these numbers that were all talking about and not be impressed you get right down to it the hispanic community is one of the most dynamic communities in the entire country your success is americas success and president trump and i both know it the president has held at least a dozen key meetings with the latino community especially small business owners in the buildup of the november th election he did this because he recognizes just how crucial you are to the american economy and as a businessman himself he knows what it takes to be successful in a tough and a competitive environment he promised in those meetings and i reiterate today to give you the help you need to become even more successful in the years ahead all my friends  i like to say if you havent noticed that the white house these days were in the promisekeeping business again in washington dc applause its been incredibly exciting since literally  id like to say day one but it was actually night one we came in from that parade and the president sat down at his desk and went right to work and hadnt slowed down for a minute since literally from that very first day president trump went right to work undoing jobdestroying policies and executive orders over the last eight years after years of delay for instance the president signed his executive order to authorize the construction of the keystone and dakota pipelines that will create tens of thousands of jobs and support our energy infrastructure applause hes already signed several bills that congress has provided rolling back reams of red tape in washington dc and he signed an executive order instructing every agency in our nations capital to find two regulations to get rid of before they issue any new regulations on americans and american businesses applause so it is an especially big deal for small business and folks were just getting started i can promise you that by now all of you know that president trump and our administration has the boldest and best agenda america has seen for a very long time and what i can tell you now is that on the very top of that list i can promise you the obamacare nightmare is about to come to an end applause now i dont have to tell small business owners gathered here today about why this failed law has got to go in the last few years its been hard enough for hardworking americans in small businesses to get ahead and frankly obamacare has only made it more difficult to grow a business and make ends meet millions of americans have felt obamacares disappointments firsthand today the average american is paying  more a year for health insurance and the premiums just last year alone the average premiums across the country spiked by more than  percent i mean i remember  i was in the congress at the time when we fought against this government takeover of health care that came to be known as obamacare and i remember they told us that it was all about lowering the cost of health insurance but think about that the premiums have gone up  like i got to tell you all anything  the premiums have gone up  percent in some jurisdictions since this bill was signed into law and last year alone that average of  percent increase has really worked hardships on americansin onethird of our nations counties consumers have only one insurance company to choose from which essentially means they have no choice at all and american businesses have been struggling too im sure everyone in this room can attest to the fact that obamacare has hit you with more regulations more mandates higher costs higher taxes the fact is obamacare has placed a crushing burden on job creators just like all of you in this room today its resulted in lost jobs slower growth in an economy that until very recently seemed to be stuck in up to the axle now i hear the same thing everywhere i go small businesses tell me that obamacare places a weight on them that grows each and every year theyre facing hard choices  choices businesses shouldnt have to make they felt for the longest time that theres nothing they can do about it and then along came president donald trump and now the american people know there is something we can do and president trump is determined to work with this congress and we will repeal and replace obamacare at last with something that actually works applause see literally the day after the election  and its kind of funny  people say did you go right to work after election night and i dont remember a night i remember the president was able to give that victory speech about  in the morning we got about two hours sleep he said ill see you in the office at  am and we were there one of the first decisions the president made was that the numberone priority in the congress when they would convene is to repeal and replace obamacare and do it at the same timeand we worked with leaders in the congress in the intervening months to go to work on that weve made incredible progress now this week the house released its repeal and replace bill to begin that process and as the legislative process begins the president and i are proud to lead the charge our plan to repeal and replace obamacare in a word is going to keep the promises that we all made with the american people from the republican majorities in the house and the senate and all of this administration and this campaign were going to repeal obamacares individual mandates and employer mandates were actually going to get rid of over  billion in tax increases when obamacare goes away applause were going to roll back reams of regulations that are strangling businesses and our economy and were going to expand the use of health savings account and create a new refundable tax credit that will help low and middleincome consumers the most were going to make sure that americans with preexisting conditions still have access to the coverage and the care that they need and were even going to let you parents out there keep your kids on your plan until theyre  years of ageand last but not least were going to give states the freedom and flexibility that they have longed for for so long to design their medicaid program in you state to best meet the needs of our most vulnerable population state resources state flexibility will bring about the kind of health care to the underprivileged that we have long sought and deserve applause our plan to repeal and replace obamacare will do what obamacare cant and that is actually give the american people access to affordable highquality health insurance and thats what president trump promised and thats what our plan will delivernow let me say despite some of the fearmongering that youve seen among some activists on the left were going to have an orderly transition to a better health care system and were working with the congress right now to ensure that as we move into a system thats based on free market principles and statebased flexibility that that system will work and be unfolding in an orderly way for your enterprises in a predictable way but passing the legislation thats moving through the congress now is just the first component of a larger strategy to repeal and replace obamacare rest assured this bill in the congress is a beginning our administration is also working right now with the new secretary of health and human services dr tom price and taking every available action to give americans increased choices and the lower cost that they deserve in purchasing health insurance the name of the game is deregulationand last but not least were going to work with the congress and work with hhs to make the best health care system in the world even better  with legal reforms small business reforms and ultimately at the centerpiece of the presidents vision were going to enact policies administratively and through legislation that will give americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines  just the way you buy life insurance just the way you buy car insurance applause the creation of a national marketplace is the center of the presidents vision and were working now through administrative policy and through the legislative process that will go forward to this spring to accomplish that in fine print i like to say what we need to do is get that little lizard on television or get flo out there selling health insurance laughter am i right about that applause its just the whole idea that you all know in a competitive marketplace  you all are successful in business  the way you lower costs is not by growing government its by increasing competition allowing americans to participate in association health plans allowing americans to purchase health insurance nationwidethe presidents vision for health care i truly do believe is  it represents the best of this country its unleashing the full power of the marketplace and with your help and with your support were well on our way to a better health care future for every american applause it will benefit everybody in this room it will benefit the country as a wholebut so will the rest of our agenda for that matter so let me talk on that before i take my leave and head back to capitol hill to talk to a few members of congress were going to get this economy moving again after we repeal and replace obamacare were going to cut taxes across the board for working families small businesses and family farms applause i promise you were going to keep rolling back red tape slashing all the jobkilling regulations were going to rein in unelected bureaucrats so they cant cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayerfunded metal desk applause were going to keep rolling back  were going to roll back doddfrank so small businesses like yours have access to capital access to the best financial system in the world you got to be able to borrow to grow in small business america applause and were going to pass an infrastructure package so that americans have the best roads the best bridges the best highways and airports and the best future that we could ever imagineand were going to stand up for real education reform the president is absolutely committed to ensuring that every american parent have the freedom to send their children to the school of their choice  public private parochial charter or home  regardless of income or area code applause i know how much that last issue particularly means to the hispanic community and rest assured with the leadership of our new secretary of education betsy devos were going to work with members of congress to make historic strides so that every child in america has access to a worldclass educationwere going to do all this and more so that everyone can climb the ladder of opportunity in the days ahead and when the president said were going to make america great again he meant it and president trump is a man of his word but americas greatness isnt simply about policy ultimately the strength of this country comes from our people and as i close let me say i count one of the greatest blessings of my life is just simply to be an american applause all of us with very few exceptions are descended from those who came here to this country came here looking for a brighter future some were brought here involuntarily our native american brothers and sisters were here when we arrived but america from our nations founding emerged as a land of opportunity in a meritbased society and the truth of the matter is that its precisely that vision of america that meritbased society that all of you personify and its been a truth literally a truth since our nations birth and as weve strived every day to a more perfect union we continue to live out that aspiration and that vision in his joint address to the congress just last week the president made a couple more promises he promised to serve protect and defend the citizens of the united states to strengthen our nations security and in his words to respect  to restore and respect rather the laws of this country now that includes the important work thats before us today  securing our borders upholding our laws and make no mistake about it as we do that the president has placed a priority  as we move through these issues the top priority in his words is removing gang members drug dealers and criminals that threated our communities and prey on our citizens and that will be this administrations focus for every community applause the president and i believe that a system based on the rule of law will benefit every american including our hispanic americans every community from coast to coast will benefit from upholding our laws and expanding our economy as president trump said to congress and i quote  real and positive immigration reform is possible and i can assure everyone here that as that debate goes forward we will as the president promised show great heart every step of the way applause now for my part i take all this very personally you see as i said last time i was here at this coalition meeting im actually the grandson of an immigrant so is the president the story in my family was that nearly a century ago my greatgrandmother walked my grandfather out of that tworoom house they lived in in northwestern ireland walked up the hill across from their home where ive stood and looked out at the ox mountains and looked to the west and she told him she was going to get him a oneway ticket to america because she said theres a future there for you richard michael cawley actually stepped ashore on ellis island as a young man on april   and thats how michael richard pence grew up to be vice president of the united states of america applause that young man made his way to chicago he drove a bus for  years and he was the proudest man i ever knew and the best man i ever knew on inauguration day ill be honest with you i had him on my heart and on my mind and as i sat on that stage as i raised my right hand i actually couldnt imagine what that irishman was thinking looking down from glory except two thoughts im sure he was very surprised laughter because he knew me well the other thing i have to think he had to conclude is that he was right his mother was right  was right about america it is the land of opportunity its the place where dreams come true its what each of you proves each and every single day if you work hard play by the rules look after your family you look after your neighbors and you keep working hard anybody can be anybody in america and i just promise you this grandson of that immigrant and the grandson of an immigrant that i work for im going to work with each and every one of you to keep the american dream alive and to renew it and make it greater than its ever been before applause and really what ive laid out today is president trumps vision and his plan to make america great again and really renew the american dream we have our work cut out for us and im confident that with your help and with gods help and with president donald trump in the white house americas best days are yet to come lets get to workthanks everybody applause god bless you and god bless the united states applause end

it discusses womens history month and his plans to repeal and replace obamacare it aired this morning on facebook live it is now available to watch on youtube and whitehousegov obviously i encourage everyone to go check it outand with that id be glad to take your questions john robertsq  i was going to say your pin is upside downmr spicer john roberts always helping with the fashion tips laughterq  its still upside downq  you wanted  is that a distress call sean laughtermr spicer appreciate thatq  house of cards promomr spicer thank you no theres no promo laughter john now on to your questions laughter but thank youq  our involvement of sending rangers and marines into syria marks a dramatic change in our presence on the ground there and im wondering how much autonomy is the president giving general james mattis to involve us forces on the ground in syriamr spicer a us marine artillery unit and a team of rangers have recently positioned in syria to provide a combined joint task force operation inherent resolve the commander the agility to expedite the destruction of isis in raqqa in particular the exact numbers and locations of the forces are still a sensitive order to protect the location of the forces but there will be approximately an additional  enabling forces deployed under existing authorities for a temporary period to enable our syrian partnered forces to accelerate the defeat of isis specifically in raqqai think as ive mentioned before one of the things that the president has ensured is that the commanders have the flexibility to do what they need to fulfill the mission the president is obviously as commanderinchief made aware and signs off on all of those missions but at the end of the day its going to up to the generals to execute their mission to make sure that we continue to defeat isis and protect the nationq  now our involvement there really sort of complicates the whole picture because were aligned with the kurds but then at the same time a nato ally turkey sees the kurds as the enemy and then theres what happens with russia and its involvement with the syrian government so the big problem with iraq was we never planned for the day aftermr spicer rightq  so what are the plans for the day after here when raqqa falls who occupies itmr spicer well one of the things that i mentioned in the script that is part of what the president has done during his first  days is issue an executive order on january th for the secretary of defense to submit a comprehensive plan in consultation with the joint chiefs and other members of the national security team to defeat isis that is part of that planand so i think you are seeing a comprehensive approach to not only how were going to engage in syria but the total defeat and elimination of isis so that is part of an ongoing process that the secretary of defense the chairman of the joint chiefs and others have been involved in in briefing the presidentq  but does the president have an idea of who should occupy raqqa should it be kurkish forces should it be a coalition should american forces stay theremr spicer i think that as we devolve that plan ill have more for you on that i think youve already killed onequestion friday but were going to get back to itjon karl onequestion fridayq  okay ill make it one sean the chair and ranking member of the house intelligence committee have asked the justice department to turn over any information that they have that there was any wiretapping of presidentelect trump candidate trump at trump tower if there is no evidence that any wiretapping took place will the president apologize to president obama for making such a serious chargemr spicer lets not get ahead of ourselves i think its important to see where that goes and i dont want to prejudge their work at this timejimq  but if theres no evidence i mean whats he mr spicer but i think youre asking well what if theres evidence im not going to get into a series of hypotheticals prejudging the outcome of a report or an investigation that hasnt occurred yet i think once thats done well respond appropriatelyjimq  thank you sean senator cory gardner was reported by politico yesterday to have said he doesnt believe that a billion wall along the mexican border is the best way to provide border security does the white house see support for the border wall weakening in congressmr spicer no the president was very clear that was something that he campaigned on and promised the american people as an effort to both protect our national security and our economic security and hes going to fulfill that pledge hes already started to work with the department of homeland security on both the plans and the funding mechanism and the bidding and the rfp process will roll out slowly  or shortly i should say but thats a pledge that he intends to maintainjohn bennettq  sean a lot of action on the hill of course with healthcare lately but april th is right around the corner government funding expires given that during the transition period you guys asked for a shortterm cr so you could weigh in once you were in office whats the white house doing right now to avoid a shutdown i talked to some sources they couldnt point to specific talks so whats the state of play theremr spicer well director mulvaney is going to release his budget on the th thats the first step in working with them to get the budget under control were approaching  trillion of our debt and i think we need to get spending under controland so part of funding the government goes hand in hand with keeping track of what were spending it on and how were spending it on what our priorities are weve begun that passback process that we talked about internally within the executive branch director mulvaney has had several conversations with members on the hill on both sides and hes going to continue to have them i know the vice president has been actively engaged as wellbut to your question i mean thats part of the process we need to release a budget first about what our priorities are for the coming fiscal year and then make sure that we do what we can going forward but this goes hand in hand with thatq   finish out the current fiscal year so does the mr spicer i understand thats fiscal year  but i think they go hand in hand i think you need to close out fy and then i think our budget lays out where we want to go in fy and i think once we have a handle on fy we can start to backfill q   a specific ask you want cuts for the rest of mr spicer im not going to  i appreciate  were not having that discussion herejohn gizziq  thank you sean and i will honor the onequestion friday the president has said in the past the he welcomes compromise and theyre open to compromise on the immigration legislation thats coming up this morning when she spoke at the christian science monitor press breakfast minority leader nancy pelosi said that she would like to see the comprehensive immigration package that passed the senate but was stopped in the house brought back and that was her version of a compromise on immigration whats the administrations position on what former speaker and minority leader mr spicer i think youre referring the gang of eight bill correctq  thats correctmr spicer i think the presidents been very clear during the campaign trail that thats not a bill that he supports but he looks forward to engaging with members to find a way forward to fix our broken immigration systemthat bill in particular i think is a nonstarter it was a nonstarter when it came out the first time i think it continues to be a nonstarter but the president recognizes that the system is broken and that he wants to work with congress to fix ithunterq  thank you sean does the white house believe theres such a thing as the deep state thats actively working to undermine the president mr spicer well i think that theres no question when you have eight years of one party in office that there are people who stay in government who are affiliated with joined and continue to espouse the agenda of the previous administration so i dont think it should come as any surprise that there are people that burrowed into government during eight years of the last administration and may have believed in that agenda and what to continue to seek it i dont think that should come as a surprise to anyoneq  and will the director of the cia or the dni have a presidential mandate to seek these people out and fire them or purge them from the governmentmr spicer thats not part of the cias mandate under any circumstances so i dont know on that blakeq  sean thanks the dnc just put out a statement a little while ago saying it is president obama who deserves the credit for the february jobs numbers mr spicer im sure they didq  my question to you how much do you feel that president trump should be credited for that and how would you characterize the economy that president trump was handed over by president obamamr spicer look numbers are going to go up and down we recognize that but i think theres no question when you look at the ceos that hire people and the ceos that have talked about the investment that they want to make in america  you can look back over the last several administrations i dont believe ive ever seen the number of ceos and businesses come out and talk about investments and continuing investments and the expansion of investments or hiring based on the vision and agenda of an administration the way they have in this oneand so its not just a question of what we believe i think if you look at the automakers the other manufacturers and frankly some of the service industries that have come out and talked about the investment that theyre going to make or the continuation of a project that they had going or the movement of one  of a manufacturing plant or job investment  those speak for themselves its not a question of what we believe i think its a question of the commitment that us manufacturers and job creators and businesses are making because they want to buy into the presidents agenda and vision for creating a more tax and regulatory businessfriendly environment to grow here and i think that those speak for themselvesq  do you believe though that hes had  that the policies already have had an impact on themmr spicer absolutely look at the confidence indexes theyre all going to the top i think the stock market has generated over  billion of additional wealth since he was elected there are several economic indicators that show signs of strength because of the presidents vision and agenda and i dont think that thats any secreti mean when you talk to the economists when you talk to business leaders they have confidence in the presidents agenda that it will yield for a more favorable business climate to hire more americans to expand the manufacturing based in america to make us more competitive around the globe and so i do believe that but i dont think its a question of what i believe or what the administration believes i think if you look at what outside economists and what business leaders do they confirm thateamonq  thanks sean in the past the president has referred to particular job reports as phony or totally fiction does the president believe that this jobs report was accurate and a fair way to measure the economymr spicer yeah i talked to the president prior to this and he said to quote him very clearly  they may have been phony in the past but its very real now laughtersaraq  thanks sean could you clear up what appears to be some tension between what you said yesterday about when the administration or the president was made aware of general flynns foreign lobbying ties and the ap reporting today that the transition team was informed of flynns potential need to registermr spicer so theres a big difference between when he filed which was the other day  two days ago  and what happened then what the ap is reporting just so were clear is that a personal lawyer of general flynns contacted a transition lawyer and asked for guidance on what he should or should not do the lawyer was instructed that that wasnt the role of the transition and that it was up to the personal lawyer to work with the appropriate authorities or subject matter experts to determine what was appropriate and what was not appropriate in terms of filingbut this was a personal matter its a business matter its not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual  as a private citizen that was the guidance that was given which is consistent with what should be done and so i dont think it should be a shock to anybody that if you asked a government lawyer what you should do in your private capacity as a citizen theyre going to tell you you should consult experts in that area to determine what you should or should not doq  that advice was  the transition was aware of that advice why wasnt that then  was the president made aware that that recommendation had been given to his national security advisormr spicer well wait a minute sara there are tons of individuals that consult with the lawyers and with ethics experts and say i own this stock will i have to sell it i own a business i own this house and for the most part theyre given guidance as to hey go seek professional help consult with this entity consult with a lawyer its almost like asking someone for tax advice calling  and what you will  if you call the irs and say hey i want to know what i should do this they will tell you to consult a tax attorney thats not the job of a government official is to tell you what you should or should not do in your capacity as a private citizen and so thats a vastly different scenario that any  whether you  regardless of what department you call in government if you call the department of education and ask them about education standards theyll probably refer you to a local entity or to a teacher if youre asking about your own child thats not why government officials  theyre very clear about the line between private action and government actionjordanq  thanks sean does the president agree with house conservatives that the sunset date for the medicaid expansion should be moved up to the end of next yearmr spicer well i think the bill that is before the house right now the reconciliation piece  and again i cannot reiterate it enough  is part of a threeprong processbut the current process does several things number one its the first time that youre going to have a full addressing of an entitlement like this in decades it is actually a very very good thing for conservatives when you look at how were going to address medicaid and an entitlement that many conservatives have fought for years need to be addressedbut that being said the president has also been very clear through all of the discussions  and ive commented on that throughout the week  that as he meets with members of congress and outside groups that if someone has got an idea that can make this legislation more accessible give more choice to the american people drive down costs make it more patientcentric he wants to listen to itbut i think right now thats where the bill stands were going to continue to listen and work with members of the house and then eventually the senate and so i dont want to prejudge where  the process itself but the bill was crafted in a way that i think represents the presidents thinking and in a  very smart way of addressing entitlements and going forwardfrancescaq  so just to put a pin in it the president is willing to negotiate on the sunset of the expansion of medicaidmr spicer right right now the date thats in the bill is what the president supports he is willing to listen to individuals on different aspects of the bill that might make it  that might achieve the goals that he set out but its not a question of negotiation we have a date in the bill and thats the date in the billbut i think as the bill continues to work its way through the house  and that goes for speaker ryan hes got members that are approaching him with ideas and im sure hes listening to them as well  senator mcconnell is probably dealing with the same issue in the senate and thats the way that the process is going to workand ive made it very clear since the getgo that this process is going to be one where were going to take the best ideas were going to listen to individuals and try to make sure that we achieve the goals that the president has laid out and the principles that he has laid outfrancescaq  thank you sean piggybacking off john and john at a breakfast this morning  the same one he referenced  nancy pelosi also said it couldnt possibly be true of the presidents allegations against the former president because that is not how our system works she also said obama would not do that and it would be a waste of time for the house intelligence committee to investigate that allegation does the white house have any evidence to refute house minority leader and former speaker pelosis claim and could you explain why the president hasnt asked the fbi chief about this directlymr spicer i think we spoke very clearly about what wed like to happen last sunday and im going to reiterate it we believe that the house and senate intelligence committee have the appropriate forum and process and staff to look into this matter and report backq  sean on flynn can you say that the president was informed at all about this arrangement mr spicer no he was notq  the need to register as a foreign agentmr spicer noq  and then did this set off any alarm bells with anyonemr spicer no just so were clear you wouldnt  general flynn filed with the department of justice two days ago how would anyone know that he was going to  i mean thats sort of like asking q  what about the need to filemr spicer thats up to his personal lawyer i mean again each person that goes through the process in government seeks counsel in many cases regarding the assets they own and the activities they conducted as to what they have to do or not do but this is something that  its like asking whether someone needed to file  if they had a client whether or not they have to file a lobbying disclosure form thats not up for us to determine thats up for them and their counsel to determine if they engaged in activities in the past or whatever it is or if a doctor needed to go and up their certification that is not up for the government to determine there are certain private citizens activities that you conduct and you seek counsel on or professional advice thats not up to the government and thats exactly how the system workedq  but how did that not raise a red flag i mean you have an attorney calling mr spicer you already got your question john were doing onequestion fridayq  but this is an important pointmr spicer no its not johnq  because you have an attorney calling the transition saying that the person who is in line to be the national security advisor may need to register as a foreign agent and that doesnt raise a red flagmr spicer no its not a question of raising a red flag john its a question of whether or not they gave them the advice that theyre supposed to which is it is not up to them to make decisions as to what you need to do or not do as you know there are certain activities that fall under each of these requirements as far as what the threshold is what activities who the funding source was et cetera et cetera it is not up to  nor is it appropriate nor is it legal  for the government to start going into private citizens seeking advice and telling them what they have to register or not that would be the equivalent of walking through someones tax return and saying thats not a deduction that you should take that isthats why when you contact these agencies they will tell you you should seek counsel or professional advice or expertise in whatever matter it is that is not up to them to determine plain and simpleglenn i called on glenn  john were going  q  moving beyond the legal question heremr spicer thank youq  just to follow up with john moving beyond the legal question here this is an issue of judgment about who you guys wanted here in your administration there were published reports that your potential national security advisor had dealings with the government of turkey a controversial regime at this moment in time congressman cummings sent a letter to mike pence during the transition informing him of this and raising a red flag mr pence was on television i believe yesterday saying twice that he had no knowledge of that lettermr spicer thats right  no no thats not  hold on it stop there no no hold on before you accuse the vice president of certain things q  yeahmr spicer now what he said was that he was not aware of the filing just so were clear and he wasnt thank you go onq  but just in terms of the larger question here forget about filling out forms and the legalisms here what does this say about the transition teams judgment about still appointing him as national security advisor when you had knowledge of this informationmr spicer no but youre asking me  forget about the legalisms thats what we ask people to do is follow the law you cant forget about the legalisms q  no nomr spicer no no thats what you said and what im saying is thats what we did they consulted a lawyer which everyone who had something of  is advised to do that lawyer consulted the transition lawyer who said it is your job to consult the appropriate lawyers q  im moving beyond the legal issues im saying in terms of  were moving beyond the issue of the papers here were talking about the judgment that the president the vice president and your team made to select this man as national security advisor when you had information that he had these dealings with turkey why did you guys still make that decisionmr spicer but its a question  what dealings are you referring to the fact that he had a client  he was also the head of the department of  the defense intelligence agency unbelievably qualified  years in the military with impeccable credentials i mean so what is it that he  what exactly are you getting at because so far he has impeccable credentials he had a stellar career in the military widely respected and i think for you to start to impugn his integrity q  no but vice president pence said that yesterday  that he wouldnt have that mr spicer but again but there was no disclosure at the time and the question is is that if his counsel worked with whomever he worked with and determined that he didnt thats up to him but it was up to him the burden is on the individual to seek the legal advice or professional expertise to decide what they have to file and noti mean we could literally have a hypothetical question about somebody who made an inappropriate filing on their tax returns or another  or a professional qualification at the end of the day when people present it with you they are advised to seek expertise and counsel and legal advice about whats appropriate and whats not that is not  it is not up to the transition attorney to go through someones livelihood and determine what they need to see they were given the proper legal advice at the time which was to seek expertise in that matter he had already obtained counsel and thats q  let me just sort of clarify the transition officials were not overly concerned by his relationship with the government of turkeymr spicer its not a question of overly concerned glenn the question is did they provide him the avenue that they were supposed to which is did they tell him to seek counsel and they did and thats whats supposed to happen thats it plain and simpleyesq  sean i guess the question for you very simply would be then right now does this raise concerns that there may be other members of this administration or other members that served in the transition that were or are currently lobbying on behalf of foreign governments right now that may be advising the president of the united statesmr spicer look i think we trust people to fill out the appropriate forms that they need to and in this case q  but thats what betrayed mr spicer  and the president acted accordingly back in the thing and he made the right call thenq  he may have been taking actions though he may have made the right call  the national security advisormr spicer but youre asking me  this is  look this is like saying  can you tell me that the executives at nbc news have gone through every single persons and reporters background q  theyre not the president of the united statesmr spicer no no i understand that but we trust people to fill out the forms that theyre required to do so in an honest and legal manner and in this case he retroactively filed the forms that he was supposed to do but we advised him to do what the legal and proper thing was and thats the right thing for this administrationso we did the right thing then and we expect every employee to follow the law this president when it comes to ethics and when it comes to lobbying he instituted a fiveyear ban he banned people  he has ran on a commitment to drain the swamp he has been very committed to making sure that we institute high standards here and that were held to themand so at the end of the day when he found out that general flynn had betrayed the trust of the vice president back in the day he let him go the president has high standards for everyone that works in this administration so the answer to your question is if somebody does something that is not in keeping with the presidents standards that hes set for every single person in the administration they will be let goq  so do you have full faith in all those people that are advising the president right nowmr spicer i believe that everybody has done what has legally been required of them but i cant tell you that every single person has done everything i can tell you the president has made clear to every person in this administration you are expected to live up to the high standards that he has set for them and that if you dont you will be dismissedq  sean the removal of south koreas president whats the reaction of the white house to it and also we know that there will be a presidential election very soon in south korea and we know several leading candidates they prefer  last confrontation was dprk and also opposed the deployment of a thaad system so does the white house looking to the impact of the election might bringmr spicer well i believe they have to have an election within  days theres an acting president who we have strong relationships with and we will continue to work with south korea they are both an ally and a friend in the region this is obviously an issue that we continue to keep up with on the developments there its a domestic issue in which the united states takes no position in the outcome of that electionits up to the korean people and their democratic institutions to determine the future of their country the united states continues to be a steadfast ally friend and partner to the republic of korea and thats itq  obviously you guys were excited about the jobs report but maybe a little too excited both you and the president tweeting within an hour of the jobs data coming out which is a violation of the federal rule so im wondering i guess both if there is counseling in you and the presidents future but also what youd say generally to critics who say the risk of doing this is politicizing what should be kind of nonpartisan mr spicer what i understand is that that rule was instituted to deal with market fluctuations i could be wrong but i believe thats why it was instituted i think tweeting out great way to start a friday here are the actual numbers that you all have reported is a bit  i mean dont make me make the podium move laughter i mean honest to god like every reporter here reported out that we had  jobs   there isnt a tv station that didnt go live to it so to tweet out great way to start a friday i think yes the president was excited to see more americans back to work i dont think thats exactly a market disruption i think that theres a lot of excitement in this country when we look at the policies that the president has instituted to help put more americans back to workso i mean i understand the rule but lets q  the obama white house for instance went out of their way not to comment in that hourlong period they would rearrange the presidents schedule around it it was something that they and previous mr spicer i get it and i think theres a difference q   going forward yeahmr spicer its not about commenting i think its one thing to give analysis and whatever literally tweeting out great news i think yes we are excited that when the president and the rest of the team saw the news this morning as reported on every television station twitter the internet and every major news site in the country and around the world  we were excited to see so many americans back to workso i apologize if we were a little excited and were so glad to see so many fellow americans back to work but thats  ashleyq  sean congressman cummings letter to the vice president in november did lay out that general flynn was being paid to lobby for turkish interests during the campaign why did that not raise a red flag to the vice presidentmr spicer its not a question of raising a flag remember  i think we keep forgetting something  his attorney then went to a transition attorney who was told you need to seek counsel on this and get further guidance thats the job its not a question of raise flags its not for us to adjudicate whether or not someone needs to file under the lobbying disclosure act the fara registration act thats not the job of a transition attorney its to tell them to seek additional counsel or to explain to them where to find that information not to tell them what to do or not to doq  but im asking about vice president specifically  not saying you should go to this attorney or giving legal advice but why when this information was brought to the vice presidents attention didnt he raise questions bring it to the president look into it furthermr spicer because i think its fairly simple to say why didnt this occur were going through several people the answer is did they seek the appropriate professional advice and counsel and they did and thats the answeralexisq  i have a healthcare question for youmr spicer oh good laughterq  arent you relievedmr spicer thats the appeal about itq  would the president be willing to sign legislation  is he flexible about the refundable tax credit portion of the house bill would he be willing to sign legislation that avoided that particular provision because as you know conservatives are concerned that thats an additional entitlementmr spicer i think that more and more as the president talks to members of congress and outside groups  number one i think theyre excited to understand the totality of this and i think he addresses this in the weekly address that you can at whitehousegov that continues to explain the comprehensive aspect of this our reconciliation piece the administrative piece that secretary price will institute and then the additional legislation  buying healthcare across state lines allowing small businesses to pool their things allowing health savings accounts to expand the streamlining of the fda going after medical malpractice  all those things that bring costs downbut as ive noted before i mean people have to remember that if you get your healthcare through your employer which the majority of americans do you are not taxed on that your employer is not taxed on it it is fairly inadequate and unbalanced for small business owners ranchers and farmers sole proprietors to have to face a disproportionate tax burden because theyre not a big employer i think this is something that conservatives should be embracing and i think the more that they understand the comprehensive nature of this they are beginning to support more q  so the president wants it to stay the refundable tax credit provisionsmr spicer oh absolutelyq  okayq  yes  house republicans that wrote a letter to the white house asking about why irs commissioner john koskinen is still in his job do you have any response to thatmr spicer i dont id refer you to the department of treasury on that yeahq  thank you sean the other day the president tweeted that for the past eight years during the obama presidency russia ran over the united states and in particular picked off crimea and added missiles which the president described in his tweet as weak given that he seems to be focused on crimea at least as far as the tweet is concerned will the president use the authority and funding granted him in the ndaa to send lethal defensive weapons to ukraine as has been called for by the house and senate armed services committee chairmans and was in was in both party platforms although the republican language was watered down and if hes not going to  i did ask you this about several weeks ago when senator mccain sent a letter asking for this  if the president doesnt want to do it is that because he would rather focus his efforts with russia on partnering to try to defeat isismr spicer well i think ambassador haley has noted at the un that any attempt to undermine sanctions that currently exist because of the annexation of crimea will remain in place until that issue is resolved im not going to  the president when it comes to his overall negotiating strategy has made it very clear in a variety of circumstances that his philosophy is not one that says im going to tell you what im going to do he holds his cards close to his vest to maximize his negotiating strategyq  but why does sending weapons to ukraine have anything to do with sanctionsmr spicer im not going to get into the presidents negotiating strategy i will tell you that as he continues to engage with the president of russia and secretary tillerson q  inaudiblemr spicer im not were not  ryan its your birthday you get a questionq  going back to  my staff weve got about several dozen emails on  we talked to congressmen this morning who were getting these emails saying if youre going to repeal and replace obamacare why not give everybody what congress and senators get can you address that since congress wontmr spicer well i think part of what were trying to do we  someone asked the other day about federal benefits right now a third of the counties around our country have one provider thats not choice i think the president understands that very clearly and thats frankly why hes pushing the american healthcare  you know why were doing this is that so many americans have no choice and that he wants there to be greater choice and lower costsby doing the stuff that were doing especially the third prong of this  allowing competition over state lines taking the government mandates away from what they have to include  thats really going to institute more choice there will be more options if you remember prior to obamacare you could go out on the open market and go from a variety of different options and tailor what you or your family needed based on the conditions that you sought or the deductible that you wanted and choice dried up with obamacare i think thats the point though is that if you want more of that kind of a system then this is the bill and the legislation and the comprehensive approach that you should be supportingq  but specifically the perception that somehow senators and congressmen get better care than the rest of us can you address thatmr spicer well thats what i  yes i think thats why were trying to pass it the way we are we want more choice we want more competition we want lower costs the american people deserve a better healthcare system and thats what this president is pushing formargaretq  sean did the white house sign off on secretary tillersons decision not to take the press with him on what should be an important trip to asia and the growing north korean threat and what are his marching orders you talked a lot about the flexibility the president has given to his generals what flexibility has he given for diplomatic initiatives to his secretary of statemr spicer as i mentioned at the beginning the president is having lunch with secretary tillerson i know that the trip was one of the topics of discussion and so i will try to follow up with that and with respect to the first part of the question press is being invited to that trip theyre traveling commercially there is a press logistics component to make sure that they can get everywhere that theyre given access to everything theres a press conference q  you can possibly to go to all three of those cities commercially to cover him in the way that mr spicer the plane that the secretary is taking doesnt accommodate that but they have made accommodations for members of the press to cover everything and i know that q  is that something you advised to himmr spicer no we dont get involved in the logistics for every cabinet members trip i would advise you to touch base with the secretary with the state department on this but i know that they have made aware of the concerns of some of your colleagues and they are making accommodations in the future with respect to the size of the planebut make no mistake about it there is a logistics component to make sure that the press is welcome throughout the trip and at every stop and that accommodations are taken care of and theres logistical support to do that there will be a press conference component as wellq  would you like though public diplomacy and this kind of important diplomatic initiative for this administration to be covered fully going forwardmr spicer i think it will i hope it will be covered fullyq  and should they be  reporters allowed to be on the place with the secretary as they have for many yearsmr spicer and i think that when appropriate they can and again theres a big difference between making sure that we carve out x number of seats and making sure that we have transparency and openness in covering events they have logistical support for you all to make sure that you have hotels theres travel support theres accommodations and filing centers i mean at some point this isnt about blocking anybody theyve gone above and beyond not every plane can accommodate every member of the pressq  you couldnt get a bigger planemr spicer its not a question  theres an element of tax q  most secretaries of state can accommodate thatmr spicer thank you i understand that and theres an element of costsavings at this point that the secretary is trying to achieve but at the end of the day there has been a press component to every stop of the secretarys trip he is doing everything he can to logistically support the press who wants to come and cover him and they are being open to make sure that secretary is available throughout the tripq  president trump has been  was very critical of german chancellor merkel on the campaign trail i was just wondering how does the white house think that will affect the tone of the meeting on tuesday and what type of tone does the president plan to takemr spicer i know that we did a bit of a readout earlier today on that theres a lot of excitement on both sides of the ocean for this trip i know that we are looking forward to meeting with the chancellor and her team and ive talked to their folks over there and theyre very excited about coming over theres a lot of trade and economic interests on both sides and obviously theres an element of national security that we share and so i will let the trips  look forward to the readout but there is a lot of excitement coming and i think the president looks forward to meeting with the chancellor and discussing areas of shared national interest with herathenaq  just following up on all of this flynn discussion i gather from today and yesterday correct me if im wrong i want to make sure i understand the answer to this question are you saying the president was not aware that lieutenant general michael flynn was acting as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be national security advisormr spicer correct well and just remember you wouldnt know that until he filed he didnt file until two days ago so therefore nobody would have known that because he hadnt filed as a foreign agent until two days agoq  my understanding is that he had filed a lobbying disclosure with congress in novembermr spicer again thats different than filing a fara request with the dojq  and one more question mr spicer well its onequestion friday laughterq  its very much attached to thismr spicer all rightq  the other question is did flynn disclose he was acting as a foreign agent in the security clearance review before he became nsamr spicer i dont know the answer to that question thats something that you should follow up with general flynn on aprilq  sean i want to go back to the numbers when is it when a former presidents spillover ends and the new president stands on his own merit when does that happenmr spicer well i think on january th at noon you start to assume command of the government and  what specifically are you asking forq  the numbers from jobs youre taking mr spicer well i think that this is the first full month that encapsulates the presidents administration i think thats a very telling number look and i get it these numbers are going to go up and down but i think for the first full month were seeing the enthusiasm and spirit that so many business leaders have been drawn to and that is exciting as a first month but i think this encapsulates a full  days of the trump presidency and so were going to continue to work forward with policies that will lower regulation and lower taxes create a more businessfriendly and entrepreneurfriendly business climate to allow the expansion of us companies and grow us jobsq  and lastly over the last couple of weeks weve heard all the negatives  well not all the negatives but a large portion of negatives about the affordable care act and how youre looking to make it patient care so with that are there any positives which you could articulate from aca that will carry into possibly patient caremr spicer i think children being able to stay on their plans to  theres a preexistingcondition piece but again remember q  thats going to states the way we understand it thats subject to mr spicer no no no but that  youre asking if theres elements i think those are some things that  and again remember there was some stuff that was part of the aca that is stuff that republicans had supported for a while as well i think this is making sure that this is the most effective and comprehensive healthcare policy that achieves the presidents goalsq  so those are the only two those are two mr spicer yes you asked  i dont know april im sure i could go through the bill and get back its very long as you saw the other day its a thousandpage q   pages versus mr spicer nine hundred seventy four pages very gooddavid jacksonq  the palestinians are saying that president trump invited president abbas to the white house for a meeting very soon can you confirm thatmr spicer i can thank you guys very much lets end on a positive note have a great weekend we look forward to seeing you take care everybody thank youend pm est

2017-03-10,Background Press Briefing by Senior Administration Officials on the Upcoming Visit of Chancellor Merkel of Germany ,james s brady press briefing room am estsenior administration official id like to welcome all of you to this backgrounder id like to start off by setting the ground rules if i can so this is going to be backgrounder only attribution is going to be senior administration officials and anything that goes on in this room is embargoed until we walk out of the room to allow us to get you the best information that we can were going to start with a brief statement and then well move to a qa so you can address  were going to introduce everybody you can address your question up here and well figure out who the best person is to answer youso again thanks for being here and ill start off by allowing everyone to introduce themselvessenior administration official so ill start with just a quick statement here to lay out some of the context for this visit so the president is very much looking forward to welcoming chancellor merkel to the white house on tuesday this will be their first meeting and the chancellors first visit to the united states in over two years the level of interaction between this administration and the german government has so far been frequent and robust to name just a few interactions vice president pence met the chancellor last month in munich the german foreign and defense ministers were here last month as well secretary tillerson was in bonn for the g foreign ministerial last month and secretaries mattis and kelly attended the munich security conference so were very pleased with the level of interaction so far and we trust that this will continuewhen he meets the chancellor the president will express his and the american peoples appreciation for the deep friendship that exists between the united states and germany we share so much history and the bonds between our people are strong germany is one of our most important allies and partners in the world and we cooperate with the germans on everything from counterterrorism to european security to generating strong economic growthgermany is one of natos strongest member states and the president looks forward to talking with the chancellor about how to strengthen the nato alliance including by ensuring that all allies shoulder the proper share of the burden for maintaining our collective defense every ally has to meet its commitments  something we know the german government believes as well so we are heartened by the german governments determination to reach natos benchmark of committing  percent of gdp to defense by  the president is impressed by chancellor merkels leadership at a time when the states of the north atlantic face a number of significant challenges and he looks forward to consulting with her on our shared challengeswe recognize in particular germanys leadership role alongside france in resolving the conflict in ukraine and germanys enduring commitment to peace and stability in afghanistan germany also plays a central role in the global effort to counterterrorism and violent extremism particularly through its contributions to the counterisis coalitionthe united states is committed to strengthening our political defense security and economic relationship with germany and with europe more broadly we will continue to stand together with the german people and we are looking forward to chancellor merkels visit on tuesdayq  does the president that germany is contributing enough money to natosenior administration official so the president believes that all allies must shoulder their share of the defense burden and as i mentioned he is heartened to hear that the german government is committed to meeting the wales pledge of spending  percent of gdp by  of course the messages from the administration so far have been strong and consistent that all allies need to be making progress towards this  percent goal and he is heartened so far by the signals he has seen from berlin regarding increases in their defense budget and so i expect that will be definitely a topic of their conversation for the concrete plan to meet this commitmentq  what will the president say will be the consequences if germany does not meet its commitment in terms of natosenior administration official i cant answer that question at present i think theyre going to have a robust discussion about exactly how to operationalize this goal and so i dont want to speak to any part of what the presidents private discussions and negotiations will be on this issue q  is  acceptable to the president or would you like it to be met sooner than thatsenior administration official well of course thats going to be a discussion that hes going to want to have with all allies including the germans but during his planned participation in the nato leaders meeting at the end of may im sure this is going to be a topic of discussion about whether it is really feasible for all allies to accelerate that timeline and so again this is going to be a topic of robust discussionq  and with the germans in particular as a leading economy and one of the participants in nato maneuvers in other places like afghanistan does the president believe its especially important for germany to set this example and to be out in front of this and ahead of the  timetablesenior administration official he does believe that germany as one of the largest economies within nato should be setting an example and should be leading by example as we do from the united states and so im sure that again this is going to be a topic of discussion about how concretely we get there to the  percent benchmarkq  hi i have two questions will the president be discussing with chancellor merkel any of the allegations that russia is potentially interfering in european elections and also will the two of them discuss any sort of engagement with russia to resolve the ukraine crisissenior administration official so sure what i can say is that the president will be very interested in hearing the chancellors views on her experience interacting with putin of course shes been doing this for more than a decade shes met with putin i think for at least a couple of dozen times and so hes going to be very interested in hearing her insights and what its like to deal with the russianshe is also very interested in hearing her insights into the minsk implementation process and really how we can work together to resolve the ukraine conflictq  what about the allegations that russia is seeking to interfere in various european electionssenior administration official yeah i dont have a comment on that issue for you right nowq  how do you plan to get around the potential awkwardness of chancellor merkel being a strong proponent of a strong eu a strong proponent of immigration when the president sent very signals about thatsenior administration official well i think the vice president during his visit in brussels gave a pretty clear message that we are interested in maintaining our strong and enduring partnership with the european union we recognize that the european union makes significant contributions to global peace and prosperity and so hes going to be interested in exploring this topic more with the chancellorq  thank you a followup to the question on russia the ukrainian process that you referred to is it envisioned that the us might play a big role in the process a direct rolesenior administration official so i think again this is going to be a topic that the president is going to want to discuss with the chancellor what role the united states can most helpfully play in this process but i dont want to prejudge the outcome of the meetingq  hi i have a question about the eu some of the eu officials have been saying theyre really worried about president trumps views towards the eu can you tell us a little bit more about that about how the eu is valued or how its not valued and how the conversation might happensenior administration official again well so i would refer you back to the vice presidents comments which were very clear and direct when he was in brussels about the value that we see in our partnership with the european union and again our recognition that the european union is a key contributor to global peace and prosperityand again im sure that the president will want to discuss again his views of the european union with the chancellor and again i cant comment exactly on how that conversation is going to go or prejudge the outcome but im sure its going to be a topic of discussionq  you didnt mention climate in your opening statement do you expect that to be a topic of discussion and what will the presidents message be to chancellor merkel about his commitment to either staying in the paris agreement or withdrawing from the paris agreementsenior administration official sureq  whats going to happen in the interimsenior administration official its quite possible that that will be something that the chancellor will raise they dont know for sure internally the united states is still working on that issue and thats an issue that still is to be determined and will be discussed im sure with the chancellor but also further clarified in the weeks and months ahead as we move forward to the g and the g ministerials and summit meetingsq  will the president be in any position to clarify what he want to do with the paris agreementsenior administration official i cant speak for the president on that i know that were working on that issue internally whether we reach a decision by the time of the meeting or by the time of the summit meetings i think is still unclearq  and just on refugees the president has been pretty critical of the chancellor for her stance on that topic do you expect that to arise in their talks and in what fashion will the president  thatsenior administration official sure yeah we expect it to come up theyve talked about this issue already on the phone and you know at this point its how we move forward on this and so the united states and germany are doing quite a bit on counterterrorism cooperation on border security internal security cooperation we have the nato action that weve already had in the aegean to help with migrants crossing from turkey so the talk is out there but there is quite a bit of work going on that we will continue to discuss behind scenes and ill leave it at thatq  the president was sharply critical of chancellor merkel on the campaign trail what sort of tone would he like to set for this meetingsenior administration official im not aware of what criticism was on the campaign trail q   migrationsenior administration official well i think the statement that my colleague made is very clear that the issue is one of several that is part of a very robust and expansive  term in american relationships so itll come up and we can have disagreements within the relationship but as i said i think both leaders are determined to  working together forward on how we address the issue moving forward on the security element on the funding element economic element ill leave it at thatq  and whats the presidents thinking in terms of how to get the ukraine crisis resolvedsenior administration official i dont know if we want to think  i cant say on the presidents thinking specifically but he recognizes the leadership role that germany and france have on this and certainly the point of this meeting is to determine how we go forward in cooperation with france and germany on this issue and thats why were very pleased to be having this so early in the administrationsenior administration official lets get a few questions from the back rowq  with the current prioritization of defense spending by the administration it would appear that the commitment to nato is going up and not down even as the president says money is pouring in from other countries so what data is informing that and then a second question is will the president be endorsing chancellor merkel for reelectionsenior administration official we dont endorse foreign leaders in foreign elections those are elections that will be run on domestic issues and domestic processes on the nato issue can you repeat the specifics of thatq  so the administration has said that defense spending would go up and that of course is part of our contribution to nato so it would appear that even though hes been critical about how much the us is putting toward nato that that would actually be going up not downsenior administration official well yes so i mean the way that the nato budget  or the commitment to defense spending is calculated i mean you look at the us defense budget its  were a global power so we are committing part of that to europe part of that to asia elsewhere in the worldso the commitment to defense spending is going to affect europe its going to affect other parts of the world as well and hes been very tough on the issue and i think that hes done so in a way that has encouraged the europeans to look at increasing the commitment as well weve already seen the statements from the chancellor and the government on this  the german government the foreign minister  on the commitment to get to  percent so were encouraged by that and so in many ways we lead by example on what we put into defense we expect the germans to do so as well and thats very much going to be how they approach the issue i think in the meetingq  i guess id like to ask two questions one is how detailed do you think there can be of a trade discussion at this point how much can you flesh out for us now on that and i guess as part of that do you think there will be any deliverables maybe its the paris deal maybe thats what it is and then  well i have a second question but ill wait senior administration official im not aware of any specific deliverables thats not the purpose of the meeting its to get together and discuss the range of issues that we have in our bilateral relationship and its conceivable that trade may well come up we dont have any preconceived views that were going to be expressing on that we want to have an open discussion on trade issuesq  the sort of softer question i guess is over the course of the past year senior administration official may i just add by the way i mean we are aware obviously that there was a trade surplus that germany has with the united states and that will probably be if trade comes up a part of the discussionq  but not in the context of the president promoting the notion of bilateral and merkel promoting the notion of eu is the bilateral part like you dont think youre just senior administration official well germany is part of the european union so you could not have a bilateral trade agreement with them you have to work through the european union on thatq  but okay so it sounds like on the trade front thats not going to be the hugest piece of the spendingsenior administration official i cant predict exactly which direction the discussion will go in i think trade will be an issue that may well be on the agenda and as i said we recognize theres a trade surplus and there may be a discussion around that as wellq  on the softer question i think that i sort of wanted to ask we know that chancellor merkel has spent many months studying president trump by watching videos and reading things that hes written and im just curious for those of you who know him well has he been similarly interested in sort of studying what makes her tick who she is how to kind of figure out a way to have a relationship in that sense and is there going to be some effort on his part  i guess reset is probably a loaded word but he spent months talking about people are going to overthrow her and the syrian plan is terrible and all this stuff and he probably  they probably both want to find a way to fix that so they can be closer allies whats his part in thinking about thatsenior administration official again i am not aware that he  whether he spent time studying her or not i assume the purpose of the meeting is going to be to build on a personal relationship and try to have the largest country in europe and the united states have a positive interaction on a range of issues so the goal going in would be to have a very positive meetingq  the g  the previous administration kept saying that the g is the preeminent international group for discussing economic issues will it be the same for the current administrationsenior administration official we dont have any predisposed position as to whether its the preeminent group or not as you know the g has dealt largely with financial and economic issues historically and then it became converted to a summit meeting in the wake of the financial crisis but as to what its role is in the broader play of international events we dont have a particular opinionq  i guess my question is do you think youll be moving more to bilateral  or are you still committed to working in these international forasenior administration official again we will be attending the g and the g summits well also be having bilateral meetings at those events we dont see it as an eitheror situation and well see how the overall summit meetings goq  given the recent wikileaks releases and given what we know out of the previous administration chancellor merkels cellphone was hacked what kind of reassurances can you give her and the german government that the united states is not looking into their television sets their cellphones their highly engineered automobiles et cetera et ceterasenior administration official were not going to comment on specific intelligence allegations well leave that to the proper agencies and departments to address that issueq  does the president still believe that other eu countries will leave the eu as he said in january and does he think its a good thingsenior administration official i dont know his thinking on that certainly its for the countries  its an eu process and im not going to prejudge what he thinks whether countries should leave or notq  and can you just confirm that youll have a joint press conference after their meetingsenior administration official there will there will be a  yeahq  thank you i understand that you dont want to discuss the allegations of russian interference in the upcoming european elections but does the united states believe that the elections should be held in a manner thats free fair and without interferencesenior administration official i think that goes without question free and fair elections without interference is the gold standard that we love to see q  just wanted to follow up on my colleagues question whats this administrations view of ttip given what you said about bilateral  on tradesenior administration official we have not formulated a final position on that we have other trade priorities that weve been looking at earlier but ttip is out there and that may well also be a topic of discussion during the meetings q  would ttip violate the presidents aversion to multilateral trade deals or since the deal would have to be with the european union and not with a specific country as you said would that then make it acceptable senior administration official again thats an issue that were looking at ttip as you said is between  one could say its bilateral in a sense  its between the european union and the united states it also deals largely with regulatory issues and how to harmonize regulations in a way that eases trade and reduces some of the burden of a regulatory burden and its hard to do that if youre doing it just with one country at timebut the broader ttip discussions are something that will await the confirmation of our us trade representative and discussions with our commerce secretaryq  would that by necessity have to wait until great britain resolves its situation in terms of the european union and the presidents expressed interest in a bilateral trade agreement with themsenior administration official on ttip i think  by the way on ttip one should point out that the europeans arent going to be pushing that issue while they have a series of elections coming up through this year including in germany and in france as well i dont think ttip is necessarily dependent on brexit occurring but obviously the leaving of the european union by the british government raises a whole series of economic issues as well that weve been in discussion with the british on and that may also come up in the discussion with the chancellorq  on the relationship between the us and germany it was particularly strong under president obama and then the relationship between the us and the uk was sort of put on the back burner im wondering if you see that continuing with this administrationsenior administration official i think we hope to have strong relationships with both countries as you saw prime minister may visited the first week when we were in office the chancellors visit is coming very soon thereafter theyre both very important relationships with us and we want to manage them effectivelyq  is it realistic to assume that we can have a strong relationship with merkel under president trump given that  his insults against her during the campaign trail and president obamas particularly close relationshipsenior administration official im not going to get into what went on on the campaign trail and i really dont want to compare q  whats your expectation of their personal relationship how strong it can besenior administration official my expectation is that theyll have a very positive cordial meeting thats been the whole leadup to it in terms of our interactions that were mentioned previously with the german representative of the german government and i know thats the desire that we have q  given the presidents criticism of chancellor merkels policies particularly with respect to refugees and generally the situation he sees in germany with regards to terrorism does he hope to convince chancellor merkel to change some of those policies or to close germanys borders in a stronger manner like the us has sought to do here particularly because he said that it was weakening germany weakening europe during the campaignsenior administration official those are german government decisions certainly theyre going to discuss security comprehensively and europe the north atlantic countries but those are decisions for the german government to make and the discussion that they have had on this already and the discussion that they will have on this i presume will focus on the areas where we can cooperate we dont relitigate the past we dont go back in and atone for things but we go forward and look at what we can do together and thats what the focus is going to beq  given though that germany is part of the visa waiver program for example does the president believe that those policies are a problem for the ussenior administration official i dont know his views on that and im not going to comment and try and guess what his views areq  just to go back one last time on the issue of russia and cyber war its obviously a problem throughout europe its also a problem here in the united states do you anticipate sort of a fulsome discussion on the issue of cyber warsenior administration official so again i cant prejudge what the portion of their conversation is going to be but im sure the cyber issue will come up because the president is very interested in us having very strong cyber defenses and in cooperation with the german government again on strengthening our collective defense against cyberattacksbut again i cant comment on how much of the meeting is going to discuss thatq  on the issue of ukraine you mentioned that the us and president trump recognizes france and germanys leadership goals in resolving the conflict but at the same time hes obviously been very critical of the former administrations failure to find a resolution there do you see any room for discussion about the us  to enhance our role in the minsk agreementsenior administration official sure so as i said previously i think thats going to be a main subtopic of the discussion on ukraine which is what role can the united states most helpfully play in the ongoing diplomatic process again i cant prejudge what the level and the pace of us engagement will be on that issue but the president is going to be interested in soliciting the chancellors view on how the process is going again she and french president hollande have been at this now for a couple of years they have a very good understanding of what the positions of the sides are hes going to want to understand the dynamics of that negotiating process and see where the united states government can factor in most effectively on thatq  do you think theres any possibility that they could ask to join the normandy format senior administration official again i cant prejudge what they may or may not agree to but im sure they will discuss again what level of representation on the united states side what pace of engagement would be most helpful in this ongoing diplomatic processq  does the president have a view of what he thinks has been stalling the process with regards to the ukrainian peace process is there anything in particular that he thinks has been unhelpful from one side or the other or something that he believes should be done to kind of jumpstart this process againsenior administration official im not aware of anything specific that hes said about that again he is still learning about the dynamics of the negotiating process and this meeting with chancellor merkel is going to be a key discussion for him in understanding in greater detail whats been going right whats been going wrongq  does he at least think that there should be a larger us role in the processsenior administration official i cant prejudge thatsenior administration official we have time for one more questionq  you guys have said a couple of times that youre not going to discuss what happened on the campaign trail and i guess my question is why not do you not believe that anything said on the campaign trail would have an impact between  on relationship between the united states and germanysenior administration official sorry these guys arent campaign officials theyre national security council staff happy to talk about germany and all thatq  the relationship between the united states and germany  does that not have an impact sirsenior administration official not on the diplomatic relationshipq  well i would like to thank everybody i would like to thank my colleagues for being here and sharing your time and your insights and everybody who is in the room and on the phone thank you for participating and i refer any further questions to white house press or to nsc stratcomm and please remember that this is background only and senior administration officials is how were going with that and thank you again for being hereend am est

contributions have and continue to be to our society our economy our family and our businessesthe president tweeted this morning about the surge in hiring in the two months that hes been in office linkedins workforce reports say january and february were the strongest consecutive months for hiring in over a year and a half a new report from adp and moodys showed strong private job growth that is far exceeding market expectations and just this morning samsung confirmed that its planning a major investment in us production facilities directly citing the presidents election as an influence in their decision the initial investment is expected to reach around  millionwe keep seeing that the wave of optimism in growth in the wake of the presidents pledges to help american businesses continues to produce real results for people throughout our nationyesterday i forgot to  there are a couple of things that i didnt get to yesterday so let me mention a couple of those yesterday afternoon the secretary of veterans affairs dr david shulkin and senior white house staff met with several veteran service organizations  included in what is commonly referred to as the big six  to discuss the presidents commitment to helping our veterans and modernizing our va the meeting represented another step in fulfilling the presidents promise to the men and women who have served our nation so

discussed education and immigration policy which are two of the areas that emerson collective focuses onthen the president held a strategic affairs lunch focused on infrastructure with leaders in the private sector infrastructure used to be a point of american pride but now an overbearing ineffective regular system can keep projects in limbo for years the president has already started removing the regulatory roadblocks that have been killing projects before theyve even begun through his executive actions streamlining the permitting process and calling for each agency throughout the government to identify regulations that cause undue burdenas the president has said many times strong publicprivate partnerships will also be key to revitalizing our countrys ruined roads crumbling bridges and outdated airports the government has wasted too much of the taxpayers money on inefficient and misguided projects by looking at infrastructure from a businesspersons perspective as the president and these executives do we can restore respect for the taxpayer dollar and make the best investmentthe president was particularly pleased to be holding this meeting now that secretary of transportation chao epa administrator pruitt and energy secretary perry are all confirmed and getting to work in attendance at the lunch as i mentioned were secretary chao secretary perry administrator pruitt and

to reiterate their support for the house bill on obamacare repeal and replace and look forward to working with congress to institute a new healthcare system tonight the president will have dinner with senator and mrs cruzand finally a couple of additional administration announcements today the president and the first lady announced the initial details for the th white house easter egg roll taking place on monday april th they are honored to continue the traditions of the past while creating new ones that will play a lasting role in the fabric of our nations history tickets to the easter egg roll are free to the public and will be allotted through an online lottery further details on the lottery and information on that day will be released later this month keep an eye on whitehousegov for updates on thatim also pleased to announce  and a little bit proud  that taoiseach kenny of ireland will be visiting the white house for the traditional st patricks day visit on march th well have further details on that visit as well as the other foreign leader visits later this weekwith that some questionsdavid smith of the guardianq  hi sean can i ask about the presidents state visit to the uk is there timing for that and what was your reaction to some members of parliament in britain saying the president is not welcome they actually used words like racist and sexist has that led him to reconsidermr spicer the president as you know accepted her majestys invitation when the prime minister was here he looks forward to going over and visiting the united kingdom as we have details to share with you further we will but there is nothing further at this timecaitlinq  does the white house have a reaction to the iranian vessels coming within  yards of a navy ship over the weekend arent they on notice and will you offer anything beyond a verbal reaction and then i have a followup questionmr spicer okay the usns ship that was in close proximity is obviously something that the president has been made aware of the president has been very clear that this provocative action is something that wont be tolerated with that i would refer you to the department of defense who is monitoring that situation and will talk about the appropriate actions they may takeand your next oneq  and then secondly does he have any plans to revamp the hb visa program by the april  deadlinemr spicer i think weve talked before about immigration as a whole i think there is the legal part of immigration and then the illegal part of immigration the presidents actions that hes taken in terms of his executive order and other revamping of immigration policy have focused on our border security keeping our country safe our people safe and then obviously whether its hb visas or the other one  spousal visas  other areas of student visas i think there is a natural desire to have a full look at  a comprehensive look at that he discussed the rays act yesterday with senators perdue and cotton well have more on that coming forwardbut i think as the readout mentioned he was very supportive of their efforts with respect to how we view legal immigration he mentioned it in his joint address that were one of only a handful of countries that doesnt use a meritbased system of immigration and that is something that we need to look at in its totalityhunterq  thank you sean i had two quick questions are you aware of any women who work at the white house who are participating in the strikes today and also more generally what is the administrations reaction to this protest and do you think its an effective way  skipping work is an effective way for women to demonstrate their power and significancemr spicer on the first part i am not aware of any that are not here i think everyone that im aware of has shown up and is working really hard to advance the presidents agenda theyre committed to moving this country forward for those of us who have joined the president throughout government i think  but obviously as the president stated today we want to recognize the contributions that women make to our businesses to our families to our economy to our society and its a free country people have the right to express themselves but i think that we should on a daily basis  not just one day a year but  days a year  appreciate the contributions that women make in all of those categories so it shouldnt be a daily thing and hopefully we can help fix that a little bit moreq  thanks a lot sean there seems to be this groundswell of conservative opposition to the healthcare bill that was offered up by leadership in the house of representatives you mentioned the president is going to be meeting this evening with conservatives what is his message to those individuals are they members of the freedom caucus will senator rand paul be there and can you give a sense about what the president intends to do to turn around that opposition that was quite apparent yesterdaymr spicer so a few things on that one as i mentioned well have a list of participants later two i think that there has been a lot of  from business and conservative groups have been very supportive of this whether its americans for tax reform americans taxpayers union the medical device manufacturing association the us chamber of commerce advamed one nation health consumer health products association the association of  amac the national association of wholesale distributors the american legislative exchange council and otherstheres been tremendous support for this weve had people throughout washington dc going to different associations and groups throughout the day the last couple days talking about the benefits of this and were going to continue to do outreach he met as you know yesterday with the house whip team expressing his unwavering support for the bill and the process that its about to encounter hell mention  hell work with these individuals tonightand were going to have a fullcourt press our team throughout the administration on local radio and local television to get that message right to the american people to talk about both the things that we talked about yesterday  why we have a crisis right now in healthcare and why obamacare is failing but then secondly why the solution that the president has worked on with the house is the right one to bring down costs and to reinstitute choice so that message is going to continue to get delivered both today and for the next several weeks until it passes the house and the senate and comes back to his desk but again one of the important messages that i think those on the conservative side need to understand is right now there is an uneven playing field if you get your insurance through medicaid medicare through the government or an employerbased healthcare you are untaxed your employer is untaxed it is those selfemployed individuals those small businesses that are paying the penalty for thisand thats what i think we have to remember is that we talk so often on the conservative side and on the republican side about the importance of entrepreneurship the importance of small businesses to our economy and yet theyre the ones who suffer right now with an inequity in the tax system and i think that by leveling that playing field and by giving them more options and driving down cost were actually doing a very conservative thing here by removing the mandate of a governmentmandated you must buy this program or you will pay a penalty and eliminating choicewe are enacting i think very strong conservative values in healthcare that give all americans more choice at a lower cost so i think that should be a very positive message johnq  yes thank you as a brand new federal employee im sure youre aware mr spicer a current  welcome backq  yes well at the moment im sure you and your family are aware that office of personnel management offers a very comprehensive healthcare program called the federal employee health benefit programmr spicer yesq  you anyone in this building on the hill their staff their family their friends  not their friends their family  well maybe who knows  very generous its state of the art the individuals involved in the healthcare situation right now the debate no matter how it plays out can they really have the kind of sympathy and empathy for individuals who may not benefit nearly as much when theyre negotiating this  all these plans seanmr spicer in what respectq  well i mean youre fine youre coveredmr spicer sure but its unfortunate  first of all im not fine because i think because of obamacare premiums on everybody have gone up regardless of what you pay federal employees make a contribution to their healthcare plan as well and i think that the  all premiums have increased over the last  whether youre in an employerbased system or not so one of the big issues with obamacare was in order to fix a problem that faced  to  million people is that the entire system got shattered and prices on everybody got ratcheted up people who were on medicaid suddenly lost their ability  so the issue was is that in an attempt to solve a problem that affected a very specified and defined group of people we affected the entire healthcare marketso whether or not you get it from an employee or not  an employer or not  but to your question thats part of the issue q  but mr spicer hold on hold on heres the issue  youre right youre absolutely right right now if youre a federal employee and a lot of cases in state you get to open a book and you get to look at what plan matters to you what plan is best for you or your family  how much do you want to pay how much coverage do you want to have whats the copay youre willing to  what services or benefits do you want as part of your plan absolutely but the issue is for so many americans they dont have that choice for a third of the counties in this country theyve got one choice one and in a lot of states theyve got none or the exchanges are becoming fewer and fewer the number of doctors and plans that take medicaid fewer and fewerso to your point i think actually were in a unique place because we get to understand what the average american should get  that we shouldnt be limited to a specified number of peopleq  i appreciate your argument very well taken mr spicer thank youq  however im going to compare a gs or a gs to a senator or a secretary of one of the agencies i mean the safety net on those individuals gives them a certain cushion then theyre negotiating but do they really have that kind of compassion or that kind of empathy for the people who in fact may be thrown off the healthcaremr spicer i think that just because somebody has healthcare doesnt mean that they cant empathize with somebody who doesnt we all have family and friends that are suffering i mean thats like saying because i have a job i cant be empathetic to somebody who doesnt have a job we all have family or friends its the same thing when we watch a friend or a family member suffer through a terminal disease because we have suffered through it doesnt mean that we cant have compassion towards that person or be concerned on how much that bill is costing them i mean thats actually in some ways  depending on the relationship you have with that person  you can even feel worse you can feel guilty about how much you have and how youre not able to help that person i think in many cases thats what drives us is to know that there are options available to some americans and not others q  i appreciate your responsemr spicer thank youjohnq  sean will you confirm that there is a criminal investigation into this alleged theft of cyber tools from the cia by wikileaks what can the white house tell us about the situation particularly the fact that it seems like theres another leak for the intelligence community thats on the scale of edward snowden and can you assure the american people that none of these tools have ever been used against themmr spicer well theres a couple things in that number one for obvious reasons it is our policy as a government not to confirm the authenticity of any kind of disclosure or hack that would be highly inappropriate for usbut all of these occurred under the last administration  that is important all of these alleged issues and i think its interesting to have it asked this way about the damage that could have occurred or what tools could be used in light of whats been going on recently weve had your own networks correspondent james rosen had his phones  multiple phones tapped was that appropriate back theni think theres a lot of concern out there about alleged leaks theres two steps to this and i think what you saw over the last week in terms of  this should be a major concern to people in terms of the leaks that are coming out and the desire to get to the bottom of them  whether or not  not specifically with respect to the disclosure that youre referring to but i think the idea that we are having these ongoing disclosures of national security and classified information should be something that everybody is outraged by in this country this is the kind of disclosure that undermines our country our security and our wellbeingand youve seen over the last two years depending on the leak it depends on the outrage its interesting how whenever  whether the leak occurred under the last administration you had member after member talking about disclosures that occurred during that last administration whether it was members of congress  elijah cummings expressed concern during the last thing  last administration in terms of the americans that were  when it dealt with hillary clinton there was complete outrage about the leaks that occurred members calling for investigations to the leaks its interesting how there is sort of a double standard with when the leaks occur how much outrage there isand so i do think its important while i dont want to get into confirming or denying this particular thing i think it is interesting how different subjects are approachedthis one everyone is immediately rushing to and there should be a lot more coverage of this this alleged leak should concern every single american in terms of the impact it has on our national securityq  can i ask something unrelatedmr spicer of course you canq  robin shahini has been imprisoned in iran since last october for collaborating with a hostile government  that government being the united states of america hes on a hunger strike apparently his health is suffering is the president aware of mr shahinis plight and that of three other americans who are being held in iran and what if anything might the president be doing about itmr spicer yeah so obviously were aware of the situation in that particular case i would refer you to the state department q  i wanted to go back to an earlier question what is the president personally going to be doing in order to sell this healthcare bill and whats he going to do to convince reticent lawmakers to come along  people like rand paul who dont like itmr spicer well i mean were on day two as i mentioned weve been out and local  talk radio and local markets the president yesterday met with the house deputy whips today hes having a series of additional meetings with conservative groups with others hes already talked to insurance agents i mean weve talked about the lead up to this with the insurance executives with companies with various members of the house and the senate from both parties he met with governors attorneys general i think theres a group of lieutenant governors coming in were going to be aggressively going after  talking about the solution that we have for healthcare both the need to repeal the current obamacare system and the need to replace it with something that gives patients the choices and costs that they need as i mentioned yesterday and i cant overstate this theres a difference between having a card and having care being told you have coverage and not being able to use it is no good and thats the thing that i think is really important when we get asked the question so often how many people are going to be covered thats not the question that should be asked  how many people are going to get the care they need having coverage with a high deductible and in some cases  or not having a plan that allows you to get the coverage you need or afford it isnt real coverage its a card and i think thats the big difference in the approach that were taking here its how do we get people the affordable care they need that theres more choice that more doctors are coming into the system instead of leaving and that is a big big difference in the approach thats happening nowq  will he be going on the road to try to sell itmr spicer i think you will see a lot of travel and a lot of activity by the president and all of the administration and its not just going to be the president its going to be the secretary the directors key administration staff the vice president has been actively engaged in meeting on the hill on talk radio on local radio on local television youve seen a flurry of meetings with outside interests with opeds explaining the problem and engaging groups and associations that have an interest in this and industry leadersbut this is going to be a very very aggressive comprehensive approach to making sure that every american understands that there is a major problem and that we are here to fix itceciliaq  just on wikileaks i want to go back to that  two parts is the president outraged by thismr spicer well i mean again i dont want to  the allegations  he has been very clear about the concern that he has for leaks this is q  this one specifically mr spicer well again cecilia if i  i think he is very concerned about the allegations that are out there in terms of what may or may not happen it is an allegation it is something that we are not going to confirm at this time but as you can imagine from the presidents previous comments he is extremely concerned about this about these allegations about this  about the potential that something  if this were true  would have on our national security and make no mistake about it i think the president has talked before that anybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law we will go after people who leak classified information we will prosecute them to the full extent of the law playing with our nations national security is not something that should be taken lightly under this administrationq  quick followup when it came to the campaign and hillary clinton the president said i love wikileaks does he still feel that way todaymr spicer there is a big difference between disclosing podesta  john podestas gmail accounts about a back and forth and his undermining of hillary clinton and his thoughts on her on a personal nature and the leaking of classified information there is a massive massive difference between those two things and i think it is again the interest and the outrage that occurred last year by a lot of democrats when it came to leaks is interesting that were hearing not as much outrage now when it comes to some of our issues of national securityaprilq  sean a couple questions one you said congressman cummings  you affirmed congressman cummings is meeting with president trump todaymr spicer yesq  in the last press conference his solo press conference the president had he talked about senator schumer telling elijah cummings not to come what happened to smooth this over and what is the conversation going to be about is it just going to solely be on the high cost of prescription drugsmr spicer well i think that the nature of the meeting stems from the conversation they had on the phone which was on prescription drugs and then im sure that if congressman cummings or the president brings up another subject it will go there im not  well try to have some sort of readout afterwards depending on how that goesbut the nature of it is an area where they agree and if you remember one of the things that they talked about on the phone was that there were probably several more areas that they would agree on and find that they would agree on throughout a conversation and i hope that that conversation does exactly what they said that it would in terms of getting to those areas of common agreement where they can work together to help solve additional problems that our country facesq  so you dont have any knowledge of what happened to smooth that over for him to come in mr spicer i know our teams were in touch with  his office immediately followed and as you know there were a couple times when the meetings had been  tried to be scheduled and just didnt work out and luckily he was able to q  hes one member of the  of the cbc right after that press conference the white house reached out to the congressional black caucus to cedric richmond the head of the caucus where is that meeting where does that meeting land is it happeningmr spicer i know that weve reached out and were looking for a date on that as well so were pleased that this one was able to come together and then well get to the next oneq  my last questionmr spicer yesq  yesterday there was a compareandcontrast with visuals show and tell if you will mr spicer yes i saw that q  yes you were  yes and you compared and contrasted about how youre going about it and how the obama administration went about obamacare one difference that theyve made note of  and i want to get your response to this  is the fact that you may have this and said that youre doing this versus what theyre doing  the one thing they say that you did not do that they did had their bill scored by cbo and you did not score it by cbomr spicer sure it is being scored look i know  look with all due respect to them this the same group that said  who passed it and then told us we could read itthis bill is online for every american to go to readthebillgop its on the speakers website we link to it on several accounts that weve tweetedq  but it was scored before they went before the congressmr spicer i understand that and again if thats the complaint this is the same group that didnt let anybody read it that jammed it through with no bipartisan support this president has reached out to both sides of the aisle had governors here had senators here to get their input there is no contrast between what we did and what they did this was a full effort to reach out to the members in the house and the senate its going through regular order in the house every member of the house and the senate will be able to have their opportunity to have amendments offered through  well through the committee process and on the floorso the idea that they can compare the date that they got it scored is pretty reaching deep on this because there has been an opportunity for members to have their input on this and to talk about their concerns to give their input on it  especially the governors who were left on the sideline last time and who have such an important role in administering healthcare when it comes to medicaid the idea that anyone talks about when the score was issued  there will be a score in all good time but the other thing is lets be honest the irony of the score is that the cbo was way off the last time i dont think that were waiting to  that thats a big issue to us right nowq  doesnt cost matter though before you mr spicer of course cost matters but look at how off they were last time if youre looking at the cbo for accuracy youre looking in the wrong place they were way way off last time in every aspect of how they scored and projected obamacare in terms of  q  but you have no numbers mr spicer but neither did they last time if you look at the number of people that they projected would be on obamacare they are off by millions so the idea that were waiting for a score  it will be scored but the idea that thats any kind of authority based on the track record that occurred last time is a little farfetchedjessicaq  two questions on the wall sean as you know the bids for prototypes went out today and i just was curious about the timing of that how much pressure there was to get that going quickly and then secondly is there guidance from the white house about what kinds of vendors can build the wall especially can international vendors build the wallmr spicer i think that process is working through  as the president has talked about before we were trying to move ahead with existing funds that dhs has and then well continue to create a timeline to ask congress for that funding were working with congress on thatand then i dont think it will be any surprise to know that the president is going to favor american workers and american companies when it comes to an american project that shouldnt be any kind of surpriseblakeq  sean its looking increasing likely that the federal reserve next week will hike interest rates two brief questions one how does the president feel about that and secondly does he have the full confidence in janet yellen who he described during the campaign as too political to lead the federal reserve and set monetary policymr spicer let me get back to you on that one i dont have any comment on the federal reserve ill look at the team what i will say is that as i mentioned at the outset when you look at the hiring and the jobs and the manufacturing and the pace the consumer confidence and the ceo indexes that are going  that have already come out in the first two months we see a resurgence an optimism in the economy by job creators to want to hire here who want to manufacture here who want to grow here and i think that our economy is clearly on the upswing and i think you see statement after statement company after company coming out and sharing in the presidents vision for moving the country forward and for renewing the optimism and building and being part of an american resurgence in terms of our economyq  just to be clear the no comment was on mrs yellen or on this thoughts of a rate hikemr spicer ill get back to you on both how is thatyeah go aheadq  sean along with aprils last question about the difference between this administration and the previous one and how to approach this issue one thing that the obama administration did do was get key stakeholders at the table  aarp american medical association both of those organizations have come out today strongly opposed to this proposal whats your message particularly with respect to the aarpmr spicer well they got a really good deal last time when it came to prescription drugs in particular i think  this is a patientcentric bill its about patients its about people its about the americans who were left behind look at what those deals got people last time i mean for all those people that are on medicaid in particular they dont have choices anymore so i would argue that the president has put the american people first and has put patients first so you can talk about  were glad to have support make no mistake about it but i think that the support that this administration and i think the house is focused on is getting every american their buyin and their support obviously look im not going to  we would love to have every group on board but this isnt going to be  every single deal we heard about it getting through the cornhusker kickback this and that over and over again it was one deal after another to get to  to buy votes to get it through the senateso if you want line up how many special interests got paid off last time versus now theyll probably win hands downq  sean mr spicer this isnt  hold on  but this isnt about trying to figure out how many special interests in washington we can get paid off its about making sure that patients get the best deal that lowers prices and brings back costsbut again i think  what im trying to figure out is at some point youre defending the indefensible nancy pelosi put out three criteria for how they judge obamacare and by their own standards they fail on all three costs are up choices are down there is no other way to judge that by every account every single premium by every standard is up choices are down across the country so there is a horrible deal that the american people got bought  got sold and what were trying to do is put patients back first in line q  but so the aarp is specifically talking about patients in their s and s the aarp describes this as an age tax that will disproportionately affect people who right now are lowincome are benefitting from subsidies under obamacare and could stand  according to the aarps estimate  to take a hit of thousands of dollars in their premium payments this year when the subsidies go away and the tax credits go away whats your message to those people who voted for the presidentmr spicer i think that  right and the message from the president is that we want you to get more choice and a lower cost and i think that as we work this bill through through daylight  not jam it through in the middle of the night  that they are going to see as more and more people will that this is a deal for the american people thats going to put patients first lower their costs and give them more choicesbut again i dont  there is probably not a person out there either through themselves or a loved one or a friend or a colleague that has seen choices go down and premiums go up sic so what people are dealing with now is not acceptable and i think the idea that anyone defending the current status quo  and even in some of the statements of some of the groups they admit that theres a problem right nowand so my advice to those people is join the process share your idea share your thought let the process work its will so that it is a bill that has input but the bill  the way it was done last time is not something thats acceptableshannonq  is the president worried though that every major doctors group  the american medical association the american academy of pediatrics the american college of physicians  have all come out and said they have serious concerns for all the talk of doctors and patients and choice the doctors groups are all so far unanimously coming and saying theyre not supportive of this is that concerning to the presidentmr spicer no i think when you look at a lot of doctors versus the associations here in washington we have had tremendous input from doctors themselves dr price himself a doctor is the one who crafted thisso you have a doctor in charge of the administrations effort to work with congress youve got several physicians and other medical professionals in congress that are talking about the experiences they have  in fact many of them ran for congress because of the concerns they saw in their own industryso while i have respect for some of the work that some of these washington dcbased associations do at the end of the day this is about patients and about the input from doctors who are on the front line of seeing patients and talking about the care that theyre able to give or not to give to peopleanita q  do you mind if i follow up on something else you saidmr spicer i do  i dont sorry q  youve talked about people having a card youve got a card but its a  deductible and theres only  doctors in your town that will see you lets say but thats better than nothing if you get cancer or hit by a car so maybe this makes access  right but it is better than no insurance so if this expands access to people and choice but it reduces the number of people who actually have health insurance mr spicer but i dont think q   so can it do bothmr spicer yeah of course it can and it will do both by ensuring that more people  right now youve got more people paying the penalty and saying i dont want healthcare im going to pay the penalty because costs are too high and was it probably five six seven years ago before obamacare went into place a single individual young individual person on the open market could get a premium  a plan with a premium of   bucks a month its in the high s nowand i think that theres a big difference youre not  for young people just entering the workplace for example your example  they go get into an accident right now youve got a lot of individuals that get off their parents healthcare and say im healthy i have no desire to go get healthcare its another few hundred dollars a month that i dont have or that id rather spend on something elseif we can get that cost down it makes a lot more sense  and get them plans that are tailored to them  yearold individuals dont need care thats for folks  that talks about certain things that  a plan that has certain things that are towards the end of life but right now youve got onesizefitsall governmentrun governmentmandated plans that offer people a suite of medical services that they do not need because theres no choice and its a governmentmandated systemi think offering more choice and more competition allows people to pick a plan that is more tailored to your needs and this goes back a second ago to what john was asking that if you can actually pick a plan and across state lines find one that suits you as an individual  as opposed to maybe theres a family plan thats more comprehensive it has dental and vision and all the things that your kids are going to need because of all the things you anticipate  thats a plan that a young family might need versus an older person thats single or a young person thats just entering the workforcebut right now theres no competition theres no choice so its not an eitheror situation were facing a situation where more and more people are getting less and less and paying more and more for it and thats the wrong way to go maraq  anita you actually  anitamr spicer my apologies anita then mara q  switching gears completely the military have recently conducted some kind of exercise at the naval base at guantanamo bay and it was preparing for a migrant crisis and there is a dhs migrant center there and i wondered if the administration has considered and what you all think about using that facility for immigrants has that come upmr spicer that particular exercise to the best of my knowledge is a rather regular exercise that occurs as do many of the exercises that the military prepares for on a whole host of contingency operations so that is a routine military operationq  is there any consideration thoughmr spicer it is a routine military operation as several of them do with our partners throughout the world where we plan for random contingencies that may or may not happen thats the job of the military  to practice for contingencies that may or may not happen on a whole host of issuesbut to try to ascertain q  okay so are you all considering using the facility for immigrantsmr spicer there is nothing to consider it for i think were fine right now there is nothing that we would need to use it forbut again i mean i think part of the goal of preparing the military going through various exercises is on a whole host of issues  on refugees they prepare for natural disasters were not anticipating a natural disaster but we prepare for them at the white house when we were coming in as an administration i think we briefed during the transition period  we did whats called a rightseat leftseat operation with the outgoing administration so we sat down and talked about cyberattacks and natural disasters and the wholeofgovernment response in some of these thingsit doesnt mean that we anticipate them it doesnt mean that we want them it means that were going to prepare for them in the same way that many organizations do fire drills its not that you anticipate or expect a fire but you prepare for them as many families do preparedness is the key to executing well and i think thats what all were doingq  and secondarily the louisville media is reporting that president trump will be there on saturday can you confirm that and is this about healthcare as you just said he was going to make the roundsmr spicer yeah ive seen that report we have nothing to announce with respect to the presidents schedule at this time but as i mentioned earlier to i think it was shannon that we will have  or is it jill i cant  somewhere in this area  we will have an update on the presidents schedule later this weekbut i do anticipate the president to be very active in his support for the repealandreplace effort and so this is what you should expectnow maraq  the cbo score is supposed to come out next week and you just called into question their credibilitymr spicer i didnt call into question  just so were clear im just q  its truemr spicer thanks matt i appreciate it i can answer their record is what im calling into question to  when you look at the number of people and the costs on what they scored the last obamacare bill on its way off thats a fact thats not anything more than thatq  well people base their votes on what they think is going to happen to the cost and the coverage  if they lose coveragemr spicer thats rightq  is there any analytic organization that you would accept a score frommr spicer well i think that theres  yeah i mean omb will probably put out a score on q  if not the cbo is there some organization  so omb is the mr spicer no no im not saying  but mara hold on all im saying is look at what the cbos record is on obamacare its vastly off i think they projected  million people to be on obamacare this year i believe the number is  theyre way off in terms of the millionsso its not a question of whether im questioning anything  anyone that can actually do basic math can understand that their projections for obamacare the last time were way way off the mark and so my only point is is that i think when they come out with this score we need to understand the track record when it comes to healthcareq   the track record is there any scoring organization that you think has a good track recordmr spicer theres probably a lot and i think members have to look at a lot of things to cast their vote on theyre going to have to look at the totality of the bill the support of their constituents the current state of things i think that theres no question  look when you look at the trajectory of the cost right now in terms of premiums you can either say  and not just the premiums but obamacare is going to collapse on its own weight very soon and the president made it very clear in his press conference and a lot of previous statements the politically easy thing to do is just let it collapse and let democrats come back to the tablei dont think thats the right thing and the president has made it clear he doesnt think thats the right thing this is an opportunity for him to show the american people that the right thing to do is to care about their healthcare options and the cost that theyre payingq  and just one last thing he mentioned deductibles before and how theyre going up under obamacare are you promising people that their deductibles will come down under this planmr spicer everything that we have been led to believe about how this is  yes this will drive costs down when you talk about opening up pooling when you talk about driving costs down because you can buy it over state lines everything that has driven up costs all of those market forces that will come in and i think every leading economist that has looked at this says it will drive costs downjohn gizziq  thank you sean the premier argument by democrats notably former president obama today is that enactment of the act that was illustrated yesterday would lead to many people losing their healthcare you certainly heard that from democrats but also several of the republican governors who were here for the national governors association including strong allies of the president  governor bentley of alabama governor hutchinson of arkansas voiced the same concern they did not want any plan that would lead to anyone losing their present healthcare what does the administration say to what is the leading argument against a new plan and then i have a followup questionmr spicer of course i would say that any governor that is concerned about people losing care right now should join us they are losing their care right now they are losing their options and they are paying too much so the answer is that if youre concerned about those principles then you should be concerned with what is happening right now and you should be concerned and want to join in this administration and work with this congressand again the big difference thats here is instead of us jamming a bill down congress and now allowing the american people to read it until it is passed as was done with obamacare with thenspeaker pelosi is that this bill is out in the open for every single person in the world to read it is open for people to let their member of congress share their thoughts share their ideas and its done out in the openi think that is a vastly different approach with how this is going about than the last time and that makes a big difference with the approach and it gives people an opportunity through the process what they call regular order to have input on this and if it can be made better then greatbut i think this time we recognized that theres a lot of work that needs to get done on behalf of the patients that are having trouble getting carealexisq  oh waitmr spicer im sorryq  my followup question is a followup question about the wall during the recent governors association meeting governor graco ramirez who is the chairman of mexicos association of federated governors warned that continued discussion about the wall and the presidents talk of building it might very well lead to the election of mr lopez obrador as the president of mexico and he is considered the most antiamerican most hostiletoamerica of any of the candidates are there any concerns that come up in the discussion of the wall namely the impact on mexican politicsmr spicer no laughter that was pretty good the presidents numberone concern is the safety of our country number two is the jobs that are impacted by this and the ability of americans to get the wage that they deservebut again this is a national security issue something that frankly when hes discussed this with president pea nieto of mexico that  there is a shared concern about drug cartels drug trafficking arms sales over the border there is a shared concern for the respect of the border because it means a lot to both sidesso this is something that we care about from a national security standpoint and then obviously the president is concerned on it both  as well as on an economic standpointalexisq  i want to follow up on what john was just  your answer was that if the healthcare bill could be made better the president is interested in that so could i just clarify when he meets with the congressional conservatives this evening who have misgivings about the legislation is he intending to talk to them about what they would like to change and is he open to making those changes is that what he  is that the mode hes in rather than a sell mode hes in a listening modemr spicer i think hes in a  very much of a sell mode the president and his team have worked very hard on this theyre very proud of the effort and the product that they have produced in consultation with the house and the senatebut obviously its going through the process and so if somebody has an idea  and that could be on the administrations side  that we believe that after a consultation with individuals or groups that theres a way to improve upon this  but thats the beauty of going through the process that we arebut make no mistake the president is very proud of the product that we have produced we are out in full sell mode all around the country talking about how we think this is the best way to solve the problem that the american people face and why we believe that the solutions that we put forward in this bill are the right ones and that will benefit themgo aheadq  and can i follow up and say  before the president meets with chancellor merkel next week is it possible that we could see the president for a more general multiquestion news conference hes been a little pressshy this week and from north korea to healthcare selling to cia leaks wed love to talk to him could we see him for a news conferencemr spicer i will ask alexis laughter q  would you ask him that laughtermr spicer is there anyone else i would be glad to ask  show of hands laughter okay thank you i appreciate it i would be glad to ask the president share your request with him and ill see what we can do on his schedule but as you can  he is very busy these days he has done a lot of sprays he will continue to interact with you guys but i will be glad to make your request knownkatieq  sean yesterday secretary price said that the bill that you guys have introduced both the repeal and the replace are starting points and on capitol hill there was a lot of talk of the starting point being a nonstarter so it seems like theres negotiations that need to be made does the president have any nonnegotiables in his bill that he will not take out even at the request of conservativesmr spicer well katie i mean i think as i was just saying to alexis that it is a starting point its going through regular order in the house and so part of that process as it goes through the committee markup hearing both in ways and means and house energy and commerce committee  that by its very nature allows for input through both of those committees and then ultimately on the floor before it moves over to the senate and the senate goes through a similar processso i think frankly were just acknowledging the reality of where the process is but were proud of the process were proud of the input that weve received from governors from senators from individuals associations companies and we feel very proud of the work that is encapsulated in this bill and the results that it will yieldand so that being said i think the president understands as a businessman that if someones got a really good idea that hes going to listen to it and if he can be part of the process to help make something better theres nothing thats going to preclude that we have been very open to listening to people were very proud of that were going to go out as i said in full sell mode but if theres an idea that comes across were going to entertain that to make it clear hallieq  sean two topics here first on healthcare then ill have a followup on that in the past you and others have accused democrats of rushing through the original healthcare law now there are some republicans including today who say this is simply moving too fast is the president willing to accept a delayed timeline if it pushes repeal and replace into later in the yearmr spicer going through the process cant be delayed  i mean by its very nature were going through the committee process there are two house committees q  but you said the timeline is being  maybe easter break  after that mr spicer but again thats subject  right but again i would argue its subject to how the house does its will and then how the senate does i think obviously we would like this to move forward theres a lot of stuff in the queue weve talked about tax reform this bill is attached to the fy budget reconciliation and i know that for a lot of americans that means nothing in terms of the phrase and the nomenclature that surrounds how congress does itbut its important to recognize that that vehicle allows congress to do certain things and not others with a vote  with a majority vote in the senate thats important there are certain things you can do through that that you cant do through other vehicles and that will take a  vote and  that you can do administrativelyso its actually  if you heard dr price talk yesterday about the three phases its actually multiphased its going through regular order but there is simply no contrast between how we are approaching this and how democrats approached it last timenumber one theres actually been input from across the aisle both from the governors who were here attorneys general outside groups house and senate democrats have been able to provide input to both staff to the senior administration officials and to the president and then secondly its actually going through the process so while we can predict a timeline ultimately its going to be up to the house and then the senate to determine how fast it goes but there are members on each of those committees and then ultimately every member on the floor that has the ability to give inputq  just one other question im just curious about this meeting with senator cruz tonight he has come out and expressed some skepticism on the bill as it stands now presumably that will be part of the topic of conversation but as you mentioned heidi cruz is coming too and im wondering if the president has any plans to apologize to her for the insinuations he made on the campaign trail mr spicer i think theyre looking forward to a great dinner he had dinner with the rubios a couple of days ago maybe a week ago he had lunch yesterday with senator graham as i stated weeks ago the president is going to continue to have outreach to members of congress of both parties hes meeting with congressman cummings today this is a president who wants to engage with members of both sides of the aisle in both houses but also groups business leaders union leaders the aflcio head richard trumka was here yesterday this is a president thats going to engage with everybody that can help join in proposing ideas and thoughts and opinions on how to move the country forwardso he looks forward to dinner tonight with senator and mrs cruz as he has with several others and i think youre going to see more  a continuation of this kind of effort to reach out and get peoples ideas margaretq  and then  i apologize i have a second topic which is does the president believe the cia has been compromised in any way mr spicer with respect to the disclosure is that what youre q  yeahmr spicer again im not going to  its us government policy not to confirm this i think he has obviously been very concerned as i stated about the disclosure of national security on any level it undermines our countrys national security and i think that  i just will say i think theres also been a big double standard when it comes to disclosures of classified information and the outrage that exists when one side has it happens versus anotherq  what do you meanmr spicer well i think that there has been a lot of disclosures about national security that occurred last cycle when there was potential that the fbi had leaked certain information the members of congress on the other side of the aisle hillary clinton and others talked about how there was so much concern about classified information  were seeing such silence and outrage from the media from others with the current disclosures now with things that may or may not have happened towards the  election when it comes to this sideso i think theres a vast difference when it comes to how the disclosures are approached yeahq  sean on north korea what is president trumps position toward north korea and what is his decision for the north korean policymr spicer on the which q  north korean policymr spicer on the politicsq  no policy q  policiesmr spicer oh policies well i mean were very troubled by the launch of missiles that have occurred from north korea i think thats why the thaad missile system that weve started to deploy into south korea is so important were continuing to work with the government of south korea to make sure that they have the defenses necessary to protect themselvesthe deployment of a thaad system is critical to their protection as witnessed by this weekends ballistic missile test china and the united states in particular both understand the threat that north korea poses to the region and i think that theres areas of concern that we can work together to protect the countrytreyq  you had called on meq  today was international womens day theres a lot of concern about access to healthcare for women will the president commit to reaching out to female democratic lawmakers as the next two phases of this healthcare bill continue and additionally what is the presidents stance on access to birth control for women across the countrymr spicer i think that question was asked and answered by secretary price yesterday with respect to womens health the president has also made it clear that he intends to have a substantial increase in funding towards women community centers that fund womens health services and that will be reflected in his budget margaretq  thank youmr spicer sorryq  sean is the president the target of a counterintelligence investigationmr spicer i think thats what we need to find out theres obviously a lot of concern i mean i mentioned to john there was considerable concern last cycle when a reporter was the target of one but part of the reason that we have asked the house and the senate to look into this is because of thatand i think it was interesting i think if you look at last week all of a sudden these stories that keep coming out about the president and his links to russia it has continued to be the same old same old played over and over again the president has made clear he has no interest in russia and yet a lot of these stories that come out with respect to that are frankly fake they are a series of fake allegations that at the bottom note while theres no evidence to substantiate any of this its the same unnamed sources associates that we get tagged with and yet there is no evidence that continues to be shown and every single person that gets briefed on this shows that  whether its senator cotton chairman nunes who has done a phenomenal job of trying to get to the bottom of thisbut its interesting i think the double standard that exists between the concern about getting to the bottom of the allegations that  with respect to the president that there are so many other issues when you talk about q  so he doesnt know whether he is the target of a probingmr spicer but i think thats one of the issues that we have asked the senate and house to look into i can tell you with respect to the other instances you look at former dni clappers comments he literally said the dni  he said the dni which includes the nsa fbi and cia did not find any evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russian agents senators rubio cotton burr chairman nunes  all of the people who have been briefed on this situation have come to the same conclusionand it is interesting how many times this fake narrative gets repeated over and over and over again and yet no evidence has ever been suggested that shows the president has anything to do with any of the things that are written its a recycled story over and over and over again and i think that theres a bit of  its amazing the president goes out last week does this joint session and then literally  hours stories start getting recycled about potential issues that come up that literally continue to offer no fact nothing but the unsubstantiated rumors over and over again and yet what is ignored is when you have someone like former dni clapper go out and literally say that they did not find any evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russian agents you have rubio cotton nunes all say the same thing that theyve been briefed that theres nothing  and yet this fake narrative q  sorry just want to make sure that im understanding you are you saying that there is a possibility he is the target of a counterintelligence probe involving russia because you just connected those two thingsmr spicer no no no i think what im saying is that there is a difference between that narrative and then the narrative that has been perpetuated over and over againthe concern that the president has and why he asked the senate and house intelligence committees to look into this is to get to the bottom of what may or may not have occurred during the  election but the interesting  margaret is that when you look at every single person thats been briefed theyve all come to the same conclusion  that nothing happened during the  election tying him to russia and yet the fake narrative continues over and over and over again and the idea that it has to  it continues to be recycled without any substance without any evidence needs to stopyesq  the president said he was tappedq  he said his wires were tappedq  he said this as a factmr spicer i understand that and thats why were q  so youre saying he doesnt know whether he was wiretappedmr spicer no no no thats not what i said was q  well he doesnt know hes the target of an investigation q  that his wires were tappedmr spicer hold on one at a time i said that the president made clear on sunday that he has asked the house and the senate intelligence committees to use their resources and their processes to examine the facts and come to a conclusionchrisq  since youre talking about whether things are true or not let me ask you  following up on something yesterday you seemed to acknowledge that the president was wrong when he tweeted that  prisoners released by the obama administration from gitmo had returned to the battlefield in fact it was mostly by the bush administration will he retract or even apologize for that given that he also called it a terrible decision by the obama administration and given that that was incorrect that there still has been no proof either of his tweets about widespread voter fraud or the wiretapping does the president have a credibility problemmr spicer no look i said yesterday  i think trey asked the question  that the president meant the total number of people q  but he said the obama administrationmr spicer i understand that im actually explaining it thats why you asked the question he meant that the total number of people released from gitmo was  what the president  but just to be clear theres a big difference  under the bush administration most of those were court ordered the obama administration took great steps  they talked about  it was a campaign promise frankly from day one to close gitmo this president is very clear that he understands the nature of the threat that the people in gitmo pose to our nation and the recidivism rate that there are among people that we have releasedthat is a concern that he shares the reason the bush administration did it was in many cases they were under court order the obama administration made it actually a priority to let people go and to actively desire to close that camp and to release more and more of those people especially in the waning days there is a huge contrast between the posture and the policy of the last two administrations on how they were dealing with gitmothis administration understands and the president has been very clear that he understands the people that are kept in gitmo pose a danger to our country and to the rest of the world theres a big big difference between the posture of those twoq  do you acknowledge that the tweet was wrongmr spicer i just said it i said that the tweet  he meant that it was  the totality of the people thats what i said to trey yesterday ill say it again to you todaydave boyerq  so can i just follow up on something else you said sean a totally different topic because you said that youre in full  youre in sell mode completely in sell mode and i wonder if the president sees this as a test of his ability to make a deal something that he really talked about something that voters responded to on the campaign trail is this essentially does he feel on him that this is him going to show the american people that he can get this deal donemr spicer well he gets  he is a dealmaker hes a negotiator hes a worldclass business leader and hes been highly successful at it so if anybody can get a deal on something its going to be donald trump thats part of the reason i think that the american people  what they saw in him that there was so much broken with washington that when it came to the big problems  whether it was domestically or internationally  that if somebody could come in and work across party lines work with another country to get a deal that was in the countrys best interest he had that skillset and thats why they frankly elected him president so i think he feels very good about the product that weve put out we are in sell mode we want to get this done but the president has an open mind he enjoys meeting with people and hearing ideas about how to make this country better how to create jobs how to create a better healthcare system how to create better schools and if theres someone that comes up with a better idea that will help lower costs and increase access hes certainly going to listen to itdave boyerq  sean yesterday in the presidents meeting with the deputy whips he was talking about his tax cut plan he said its going to be the biggest since ronald reagan maybe even bigger he said i know exactly what were looking at most of us know exactly the plan so my first question is really easy tell us about the planmr spicer what the plan isq  the tax cut planmr spicer well again im going to wait until  thank you i appreciate the layup dave laughter but ill leave it to him to work with congress when were ready to roll it out we will do just that were not there yet so lets go on with the next hopefully q  secondly building on these jobs numbers today that look very positive obviously theres a lot of ceos out there who are excited about the possibility of a tax cut plan and yet the president has also expressed a lot of concern about the national debt if youre going to get a tax cut on the level of ronald reagan a historicsized tax cut how are you going to do that balance the needs for continued job growth with the concerns about the debtmr spicer because i think that one of the best ways to get the national debt down is to grow the economy the more the economy is growing the more we can get it at three four five percent the more the deficit goes down thats just the best way to tackle the deficit is to grow the economy put people back to work create a deeper manufacturing base i mean that is  between that and some of the efforts that the president has put in to make government more efficient and effective and save money at that level those are the two things that i think combine to get the deficit downjennifermr spicer hi sean of the more than  syrian refugees who are in this country less than  of them are christian shia or yazidis  the same groups that the us government acknowledges are literally being at risk of being wiped off the map so i wonder now that secretary tillerson has had time to settle in and as you review the refugee program immigration policy is this something thats being discussed is this a priority to give these groups some reliefmr spicer well i think that you know that when we talked the first time about the executive order it was something that we acknowledged there is definitely an area where  in the executive order that we just passed one of the areas that we talked about was  and id have to go back and look at the exact phraseology but we recognize that certain groups and they can be religious in nature are being persecuted and i think that thats going to be a factor on how we look at that program its something that the president as you mentioned hes talked about in the past its something that secretary tillerson has acknowledged and thats not just refugees coming into this country but i think one of the reasons that we need safe havens in syria is to make sure that groups and individuals whether they be part of a group or religion who are being persecuted have a degree of safety that they can count onq  thanks sean appreciate it mr spicer no noq  mike mariaq  right here thank youmr spicer its international womens day mikeq  exactly thank you so much so the president is on the record saying that he supports some sort of legalization for many of the undocumented people in the country and you know theres a dreamer that was caught in the raids in seattle washington we dont know if he is going to be released or not does the president want to or plan to meet with dreamers to talk about whats on his mind about gathering ideas for some sort of legalization and if so when would that meeting occurmr spicer the president i think has talked about how he wants to tackle this holistically and back to chriss question a second ago i think he has made clear that if theres someone who has the ability to strike a deal to get people in a room and acknowledge well we have to stay true to our principles that we can get a deal on a way to fix our broken immigration problem it is himwe are not at that phase yet this is something that he has talked to senators about and i think that as we continue to move forward obviously the focus now is on obamacare repealing and replacing it with this program but it is something that were going to continue to move forward with and as a comprehensive thing  not just the illegal issue but the visa issue how we deal with the other folks that are in this country but stay tuned weve got more to go on this well go furtherwhats thatq  no meeting on the works with dreamersmr spicer there is nothing on the schedule at this pointq  im sure youre aware of reports that the president had ordered the pentagon to step up the attacks on al qaeda in yemen does this mark a new strategy rather and does the president delegate now to the pentagon attacks on either isis or al qaedamr spicer well i think the president talked about this a lot during the campaign about giving the authority and trusting the generals and the decisionmakers of his national security team with executing what they need to to prosecute the war on terror and the war against radical islamic terrorismso its not a question of delegating authority there are certain things  and we addressed this in the briefing in previous weeks  but theres a big difference hes not delegating the authority but making sure that they have the ability and the timeliness to act in an appropriate manner to prosecute the case and to go after terrorists in a way that they probably werent last timeso i mean there is a big difference between the approach of this president and the last administration in terms of giving the generals and the leaders in the national security team and the defense department the tools and authority they need to prosecute the case against isissarah gabby sorryq  thanks sean youll get it one daymr spicer i know you guys switchq  israels defense minister said yesterday that us officials had sent a direct warning to prime minister netanyahu against annexing parts of the west bank i wanted to know if that was at the request of president trump and then also if you could tell us where the white house is in terms of reaching a deal with israel on what they consider permissible settlement constructionmr spicer well as you know yesterday the president spoke with prime minister netanyahu that conversation largely had to deal with areas of regional security i dont have anything further to readout on that and i know that when they met here at the white house there was discussion of settlements and the president was very clear about what his desires and his wishes were i think as we continue to follow up with israel in the coming weeks we will have more on thatq  thank you ronica cleary with fox  i have a followup question to actually his asking about the thousands of women who have chosen to strike today and you saying that it is a free country but at channel  weve reported quite a bit on the schools and the districts that are closing because so many women chose to strike todayso it is a free country but what would be the presidents reaction to if you will what is more important the students being at school today or the womans right to strike and kind of make a statement if you will on this daymr spicer yeah thanks ronica i think its an important question i mean youve  i know locally this affects a lot of individuals throughout northern virginia and maryland and the district so look i think  i havent talked to the president specifically about this obviously as i mentioned people have a right to express themselves under our first amendment as the president is doing today by making sure that we appropriately salute the contributions that women make to this country but theres clearly an impact in the case of schools  localities throughout the country here in the greater washington dc area but i think that that concern is best utilized by parents through their local school boards and through their city councils and mayors whether or not they found it appropriate for that to occur i have not spoken to the president about this but i think theres a balance and i think that  i would hope that we should use this opportunity to recognize the role of women in the workplace in the family and throughout society for the contributions that they continue to make and have made in the past in making the country as great as it hasso with that one last thing just to clarify i think jill asked this but i just want to be really clear on one point which is there is no reason that we should  that we have to think that the president is the target of any investigation whatsoever im sorry that was margaret i apologizeq  specifically counterintelligencemr spicer right and there is no reason to believe that he is the target of any investigation i think thats a very important point to make and so q  so retract your previous mr spicer no no no it doesnt  what im saying is  hold on the one question dealt with whether or not the tweet dealt with wiretaps during the thing the other is an investigation they are two separate issues and there is no reason to believe that there is any type of investigation with respect to the department of justicethank you guys ill see you tomorrow thank you see you guys q   leaksmr spicer not that  i cant comment thank you guysend pm est

2017-03-07,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 3/7/2017, #18 ",james s brady press briefing room pm estmr spicer hey guys i brought a guest good afternoon first off at the top i want to acknowledge that theres been an additional wave of threats to jewish community centers and antidefamation league offices according to some reports there have been over a hundred bomb threats phoned in to jewish institutions since the start of this year alone as the president said at the beginning of his joint address were a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its forms we denounce these latest antisemitic and hateful threats in the strongest terms it is incredibly saddening that i have to continue to share these disturbing reports with you and i share the presidents thoughts that he fervently hopes that we dont continue to have to share these reports with you but as long as they will  as long as they do continue well continue to condemn them and look at ways in which we can stop themnow on to news of the day you saw president trump yesterday continue to deliver on two of his most significant campaign promises protecting the country against radical islamic terrorism and repealing and replacing obamacare with a patientcentric alternative we talked a lot about the executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorists entering the united states yesterday and so on to obamacare id like to introduce the secretary of health and human services dr tom price to come up and talk to you a little bit about the plan to repeal and replace obamacaredr pricesecretary price thanks sean good afternoon first let me just share with you what an honor it is to serve as the secretary of health and human services im the third physician out of  individuals whove had the privilege of serving as the secretary of health and human services and the mission at our department is to improve the health and safety and wellbeing of the american people and we take that mission very very seriouslyand for many americans right now their ability to gain healthcare or health coverage is a real challenge for most americans they receive their health coverage through their employer its about  million folks those individuals will see no significant change other than there wont be a penalty for not purchasing coverage for the folks in the medicare system there will be no changes at all in the current law but were talking about those people in the individual and smallgroup market the moms and pops the folks who run the corner grocery store the corner cleaners those individuals out there are having huge challenges gaining care and gaining coverageand then medicaid is a program that by and large has decreased the ability for folks to gain access to care and we want to make certain that we address thatthis is about patients this is not about money this is not about something else this is about patients and sadly the costs are going up for those folks in the individual and smallgroup market the access is going down and its only getting worse you know the stories premiums increased  percent over the last year on average arizona had an increase of  percent deductibles are going up for many many folks if youre a mom or a dad out there and you make    your deductible in this market in that individual and smallgroup market oftentimes is    a yearwhat that means is youve got an insurance card but you dont get care because you cant afford the deductible and we know that this is happening by talking to the folks who are out there trying to provide the carea third of the counties in the united states  onethird of the counties in the united states have only one insurer offering coverage on the exchange five states only have one insurer offering coverage on the exchange one insurer is not a choice so we need to make certain that we correct thatin tennessee this morning it was announced that there are a number of counties that have no insurer offering coverage on the exchange insurers are leaving the market on the exchange last year there were  insurers that were providing coverage  that were offering coverage on the exchange now there are  thats a loss of about  percent in one year alone and all of this means that patients are not getting the care that they neednow the principles that we have as our guiding star are affordability we want a system thats affordable for everybody accessibility we need a system thats accessible for everybody a system thats of the highest quality a system that incentivizes innovation in the healthcare system and a system that empowers patients through both transparency and accountabilitythe president spoke last week last tuesday to a joint session of congress and he laid out his principles first wanted to make certain that those with preexisting illness and injury were not priced out of the market nobody ought to lose their coverage because they get a bad diagnosisin terms of affordability health savings accounts  growing choices for patients is incredibly important tax credits that allow individuals to be able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want not that the government forces them to buy weve always talked about  in terms of what kinds of reforms need to be put in place that we need to equalize the tax treatment for the purchase of coverage those again in the employersponsored market they get a tax benefit for buying health coverage those folks that are out there in the individual and smallgroup market no tax benefit and thats what this plan would dostate flexibility its incredibly important that we allow the states to be the ones that are defining what health coverage is have the flexibility especially in the medicaid program to be able to respond to their vulnerable populationlawsuit abuse the president mentioned and its incredibly important that  the practice of defensive medicine wastes billions and billions of dollars every single year and we need to make certain that were addressing that as well the president also talked about a glide path an appropriate transition to this new phase for healthcare for our country and thats important as well so that nobody falls through the cracks buying across state lines buying insurance across state lines the president talked about this on the campaign over and over the american people understand the commonsense nature of purchasing across state lines and it increases competition and we need to make certain that that happens and then addressing the incredible increase in drug pricesthere are three phases of this plan one is the bill that was introduced last evening in the house of representatives thats the start of all of this second are the all the regulatory modifications and changes that can be put into place as you all well know the previous administration used regulations to a faretheewell  in fact there were  specific rules that were put out as they relate to obamacare over  letters of guidance and the like and we are going to go through every single one of those and make certain that if they help patients then we need to continue them if they harm patients or increase costs then obviously they need to be addressed and then theres other legislation that will need to be addressed that cant be done through the reconciliation processso the goal of all of this is patientcentered healthcare where patients and families and doctors are making medical decisions and not the federal government we commend the house for the introduction of the bill yesterday and we look forward to working with all individuals in this process and i look forward to a few questions yes sirq  mr secretary youre familiar from your time in the house with the clout that conservative groups like the club for growth and heritage action have with rankandfile members what does it say about this legislation that these groups are already out with opposition to itsecretary price well i think that this is the beginning of the process and we look forward to working with them and others to make certain that again we come up with that process that aligns with the principles that weve defined that they actually adhere to or agree with as well and that is that we need a system thats affordable for folks a system thats accessible for individuals thats of the highest quality that incentivizes innovation and that empowers patientsand so we look forward to working with them through this processq  secretary congressman chaffetz said today that americans may need to forgo a new iphone to pay for healthcare and theyll have to kind of make these choices does the administration agree with that will americans under this plan  will they need to maybe sacrifice other goods to pay for their healthcare secretary price this is an important question because whats happening right now is that the american people are having to sacrifice in order to purchase coverage and as i mentioned many individuals cant afford the kind of coverage that they have right now so theyve got that insurance card but they dont have care what our desire is is to drive down the healthcare costs for everybody and the way that you do that is to increase choices for folks increase competition return the regulation of healthcare where it ought to be which is at the state level not at the federal level all of these things that taken in their aggregate will in fact decrease the costs of healthcare and health coverage and that will allow folks to be able to purchase the coverage that they wantyes sirq  thank you dr price i have two questions for you first has to do with guarantees that you can make as the administrations point person on this legislation can you guarantee that whatever legislation emerges and makes it to the presidents desk will allow individuals if they like their doctor they can keep their doctor and the second guarantee is can you also guarantee that healthcare premiums for individuals will come down with this new legislationsecretary price again a remarkably important question because as youll recall the promise from the last administration was if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor if you like your plan you can keep your plan both of those promises turned out to be not truewe think its incredibly important for the american people to be able to select the physician and the place where theyre treated themselves that the government ought not be involved in that process and so our goal is absolutely to make certain that individuals have the opportunity to select their physicianin terms of premiums we believe strongly that through this whole process and as it takes effect that well see a decrease in not only the premiums that individuals will see but a decrease in the cost of healthcare for folks remember that was another promise that the previous administration made that youd see a decrease in  on average for families across this land in fact what theyve seen is an increase of  or so were going to go in the other direction were going to go in a direction that empowers patients and holds down costs yesq  mr secretary you are quite a distance away from conservatives with this plan in the central part of it which is tax credits which they see as yet another entitlement very similar to the entitlement of obamacare but different in form how do you convince them since its going to take tax credits to make this work that they need to swallow this and move forward with the bill i mean youre getting an awful lot of opposition on the central tenet of this whole thingsecretary price this is all about patients and in order to provide that transition and in order to make it so that nobody falls through the cracks weve got to have a system that allows for individuals to gain the kind of coverage that they want and we conservatives and others have said for a long long time that we believe its important to equalize the tax treatment for those purchasing coverage gaining coverage through their employer and those not and the tax credit is the opportunity to be able to equalize that tax treatment folks have talked about this for many many years actually so that theres not a distortion in the tax code for whos able to gain a benefit for being able to purchase coverage and notq  sir mr secretary you were talking about making sure people dont fall through the cracks the last administration with obamacare focused in on making sure the underserved were part of the equation what is the safety net or the safeguard that you have to make sure  to ensure people dont fall through the cracks beyond the tax incentives but also for the underserved who are now part of  many are now part of the program that werent before prior to obamacaresecretary price yes this is extremely important as well and the current system as you likely know for those vulnerable in our population especially in the medicaid population this is a system thats broken youve got a third of the physicians in this country  onethird of the doctors in this country that would be eligible to see medicaid patients who arent seeing medicaid patients right now and its not because theyve forgotten how to take care of patients its because of the rules that are in place that make it too onerous or too difficult for them to see medicaid patientsso we believe that its important to allow states to have that flexibility to fashion the program for their vulnerable population that actually responds to that population in a way that gives them the authority them the choices them the opportunity to gain coverage and the care that they believe most appropriateq  what if you find out that that is not happening when you give it to the states is there some type of punishment or some type of piece that youre going to put in place to make sure that that happens that they follow through on your intentsecretary price yes absolutely theres accountability throughout the plan that we have that would allow for the secretary and the department to be certain that the individuals that we believe need to be cared for are being cared for in the state at the appropriate level but we believe this is a partnership this is about patients and partnershipthe previous administration tended to make it about government we believe its about patients and partnership and we want to partner with every single person in this land who wants to make certain that we allow the kind of choices and quality to existq  the president tweeted earlier today he described this bill as our wonderful new healthcare bill theres been a little bit of confusion does this represent the administrations bill and is there anything in this bill that the administration cannot supportsecretary price this has been a work in progress as you know this has been going on for over a year the work that i had the privilege of participating in when i served in the house of representatives in the last congress was open and transparent and we invited folks in to give their ideas and tens if not hundreds of people had input into that processthis grew out of that and over the past number of weeks weve been having conversations with folks on the hill in the house and in the senate and other stakeholders and so this is a work product that is a result of all of that process the president and the administration support this step in the right  what we believe is in the right direction a step that repeals obamacare and gets us moving in the direction of those principles that i outlinedq  do you support everything thats in that bill thats sitting on the table sir do you support everything thats in the bill sitting on the table sirsecretary price this is a work in progress and well work with the house and the senate in this process as you know its a legislative process that occurs im glad you pointed out the bill is on the table there as youll see this bill right here was the bill that was introduced in  and  by the previous administration notice how thick that is some of you will recall that i actually turned the pages and went through that piece of legislation in a youtube the pile on the right is the current bill and what it means is that we are making certain that the process that the decisions that are going to be made are not going to be made by the federal government theyre going to be made by patients and families and doctorsone last q  mr secretary given the opposition that john and others have brought up here today does this plan already need to be salvaged in your view and how do you do itsecretary price oh no you know what happens with these things you start at a starting point people engage and they get involved in the process sometimes to a greater degree nothing focuses the mind like a bill thats currently on the table and that has a  as a work in progress  or in process and well work through itq  so this is a starting point heresecretary price this is an important process to be had the american people have said to their elected leaders that the obamacare process for them gaining coverage and care is not working thats what theyve said and so we believe its important to respond to the american people and provide a healthcare system that allows for them to purchase the kind of coverage and care that they desireyesq  you said in your letter to the house chairman that necessary technical and appropriate changes might need to be made for this bill to reach the presidents desk so what specific changes is the white house and the administration looking for in this billsecretary price well as i mentioned there are three different phases to this process one is this bill this legislation thats working through under the rules of reconciliation which is a fancy term to mean that there are only certain things that you can do from a budgetary standpoint has to affect either spending or revenue there are things that you cant do in this bill and those we plan on doing across the horizon in phase two which is the regulatory portion and then in phase three which is another piece of legislation that would be going through the house and the senate with a majority  supermajority in the senatethat process will incorporate all of the kinds of things that we believe are absolutely necessary to reconstitute that individual and smallgroup market and to get us in a position again where patients and families and docs are making these decisionsq  mr secretary bearing in mind that the cbo score isnt back yet can you guarantee that this plan will not have a markedly negative impact on deficit or result in millions of americans losing health insurancesecretary price what i can say is that the goal and the desire i know of the individuals on the hill is to make certain that this does not increase the cost to the federal governmentq  mr secretary two elements of the bill i have questions about how they control costs and how they help with access the medicaid percapita block grant through the states how is that sort of fundamentally different from the obamacare regime on medicaid in terms of expanding accessand then the second point why doesnt this bill do away with the costsharing community ratings regime that obamacare hadsecretary price so the percapita cap medicaid again is a system that doesnt work for patients youve got folks out there who need care who need to see particular physicians who arent able to see them all americans should be saddened by the situation that we have when there are patients out there that cant get the care that they need we believe one of the keys to providing appropriate care in the medicaid population is allowing the states to have the flexibility to address that medicaid populationremember medicaid population is four different demographic groups its those who are disabled its those who are seniors its healthy moms and kids by and large those are the four main demographic groups and we the federal government force states mostly to take care of those individuals in exactly the same way if you describe that to the folks back home on main street they say that doesnt make any sense at all you need a program thats different for the healthy moms and kids to respond to their needs thats different than folks who are disabled and seniorsand so what we believe is appropriate is to say to the states you know your population best you know best how to care for your vulnerable population were going to watch you and make certain that you do so but you know how to do that and that will decrease costs markedly in the medicaid program were wasting significant amounts of money  not that folks are getting too much care were wasting it because its inefficient and theres significant abuse in the systemso in terms of the costsharing i think that the costsharing measures are being addressed its important that we run through that process this is the process where we felt the previous administration was spending money that they didnt have the authority to spend and congress is working through that to make certain that the rightful holders of the authority to spend money in this nation which is the congress of the united states exercises that authorityq  how does the white house and you feel about the label trumpcaresecretary price ill let others provide a description for it i prefer to call it patient care this is about patients at the end of the day this isnt about politicians this isnt about insurance companies this is about patients and patients in this nation especially those in the individual and smallgroup market these are the folksi had the privilege of going to cincinnati last week with the vice president to a smallbusiness roundtable and one of the business owners one of the smallbusiness owners there said he had  employees last year at this time this year he has  employees  not because he doesnt have the work but because of the cost of health coverage for those individuals forced him  forced him  to let three people gonow theyre being forced to let three people go because the federal government has put in place rules and regulations that make it virtually impossible for folks in the individual and smallgroup market to provide coverage for their employees this is a system thats not working for people so if we focus on the patients  ill call it patient care if you focus on the patients well get to the right answerq  mr secretary a major complaint  sorry  a major complaint of conservatives with phase one of the obamacare repealandreplace is that it is missing a measure that would allow healthcare to be sold across state lines now the president said this morning that that would be in either phase two or phase three is that something that you believe the president could do through executive action and then you yourself could do or is that something that you believe has to be addressed legislativelysecretary price there are different aspects to the purchase across state lines that will allow individuals to gain again the kind of choices that they want some of this might be able to be done from a regulatory or a rules standpoint some of it will require legislation and thats where were going to need the assistance of our friends on the other side of the aisle the american people have demanded that they be able to purchase coverage across state lines purchase coverage that they want for themselves so whether its through association health plans which allows individuals who are in smallbusiness groups like the fellow that i just mentioned to pool together nationally to be able to purchase coverage or whether its mom and dad who dont gain coverage through their employer through something called individual health pools that allows folks to pool together solely for the purpose of purchasing coverage even though theyre not otherwise economically aligned that allows people  there are  million folks in that individual and smallgroup market that would allow those individuals to be able to purchase coverage and get the purchasing power of millions thats huge power and authority that we want to put in the hands of people that we want to put in the hands of patients and some of that may in fact require legislationyes sirq  mr secretary thank you two questions but first congressman john faso of new york has said that the issue of denying federal funds to planned parenthood should be separate from whatever healthcare bill finally emerges from congress and is signed into law by the president is that the administrations position as well and my second question is this you mentioned earlier the people who had their healthcare plans cancelled when they thought they could keep it i believe in your state of georgia more than a million people had that experience will some of the plans that were cancelled be able to come back under the new healthcare plansecretary price yeah in terms of planned parenthood we think its important that the legislature work its will on this process its incredibly important that we not violate anybodys conscience we want to protect the conscience provisions that exist its also important to appreciate that through community health centers the bill thats being proposed right now would allow greater access for women to healthcare in greater numbers of facilities across this land and theyve actually proposed more money for womens healthcare than currently exists so i think that theyre working their best to address that issuein terms of whether or not old plans that were available before might be available absolutely and we believe that the opportunity to provide a robust market robust choices for individuals across this land will be secured and again thats one of the keys to bringing down the premium costs of bringing down the cost for health coverage so were excited about that and look forward to that coming to passq  if the new plan calls for repealing the revenuegenerating taxes and penalties but keeping the entitlements how is that sustainablesecretary price thats the work that somebody mentioned over here  the congressional budget office score and once the congress receives that score then theyll be working through that to make certain that in fact it is fiscally responsible imagine if you would however a system where the incentives within the system are all to drive down costs to provide greater choices and competition for folks and respond to the specific needs of patients and in so doing what you do is actually get a much more efficient system for the provision and the delivery of healthcare its a system we dont have right now because the previous administration felt that the government  the federal government ought to do all of this and weve seen what came about when the federal government does all of that  that its increasing premiums increasing deductibles decreasing choices youve got a card that says youve got insurance and you walk in and you cant afford what it is thats trying to  for the doctor thats trying to take care of youso this is not a system thats working for folks in that individual and smallgroup market and in the exchangesq  mr secretary many have complained that obamacare resulted in higher wait times in the emergency room will this new bill cause that have you have any idea on thatsecretary price one of the things that the previous administration said was that they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of healthcare and that is the emergency rooms in fact they did just the opposite and much of that is because of again the rules and the regulations that they put in place so from our perspective we believe that if individuals are able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want then theyll have access to the kind of doctors and other providers that they desire and wont need to be able to be seen in the emergency room theyll already have the care emergency rooms ought to be for emergencies not for the standard care that individuals tend to receive right now so we believe that if you put in place the right system then emergency rooms and emergency physicians will be able to have the opportunity to care for those individuals that appropriately present to their departmentq  mr secretary im interested in following up on your comment that its important that no one vote on anything that violates their conscience federal funding already cant be used for abortions but are you saying that the administration has a position on provision of birth control at these community health centers and secondly is the administration looking to actively withhold funding to planned parenthood if they continue to provide abortions as has been reportedsecretary price were working through all of those issues as you know many of those were through the rulemaking process and were working through that so thats not a part of this piece of legislation right hereq  but you dont have a view on provision of birth control and access to it when youre talking about womens healthcare which you brought up and saying you wanted to expand more community fundingsecretary price yeah what were doing as i say is working through the rules and the regulations to see where the previous administration was see how they did it and whether or not it needs to be addressed with the understanding that what we believe is important when we look at the rules and regulations is to define whether or not that rule or regulation actually helps patients and decreases costs or harms patients and increases costs if it does the latter then we need to do away it if it does the former then we ought to accentuate it q  what was the issue of conscience you were talking about what was the issue of conscience you were talking about thensecretary price to make certain that individuals in the market are not forced to do things that violate their conscienceyes sirq  secretary thank you sir common people and the small businesses have been waiting for this new bill under president trump so any message sir for themsecretary price well i think that this is the culmination of years of work its the culmination of years of concern and frustration by the american people they knew at the time that the previous bill  the previous law passed that it wasnt going to help them they knew that costs were going to go up in fact we predicted at the time that costs would go up and that access would go down and so this is the culmination of years of hard work by the electorate by the citizens of this country to say that we want a system again that respects patients and families and doctors in these decisionsone moreq  thank you mr secretary the president tweeted out earlier today that he believes that hes working on a plan to have drug prices come down by spurring competition can you tell us a little bit about what that plan is going to be when it might be rolled out is it part of these phases and then the second question the bill also includes a tax break for insurance executives that make more than  you said this is about patients why is that tax break important for this legislationsecretary price to the latter im not aware of that ill look into thatdrug pricing is really important so many individuals are now having significant difficulty being able to afford the medications that theyve been prescribed and its not able to be addressed specifically in this phase one because its not a revenue or spending issue for the federal government so it cant be in this phase onebut in phase two and three  which may be concurrent along with this phase one  but in phase two and three then we look forward to bringing solutions to solve the remarkable challenge that patients have across this line with the increase in pricing of drugs ive got to run youve got a guy right here who is going to answer all the rest of the questions thank you so much god bless youmr spicer thank you dr pricelet me just kind of continue on the bottom line i think that the secretary was making is that obamacare sought to cover  million people and in the process it drove up costs for everybody whether or not you were in the exchange or not most people get their insurance through their employers older populations get their healthcare through medicare lowincome populations get their healthcare through medicaid and veterans get their insurance through tricare so what were talking about here is a very defined amount of individuals that were trying to address and not affect the entire systemobamacare turned our healthcare system on its head to address the pool of individuals who dont fall into any of the buckets that i mentioned our plan that were talking about today with the house will ensure that those individuals receive the care that they need if they want an affordable cost while not sending rates skyrocketingobamacare was an overcomplicated bill that served the special interests and not the american people these over  pages that were passed and then we were told we had to read them are filled with carveouts by over  billion of healthcare related lobbying that were spent on the year that obamacare was crafted our plan in far fewer pages   much smaller much bigger  so far were at  for the repeal plan and  pages for the replacement portion well undo this and remember half of it  of those pages are the repeal part so when you really get down to it our plan is  pages long half of what we actually even have there well undo the massive disaster and replace it with a plan to return healthcare back to the patientas the president outlined in his joint address he expects five core principles to guide congress through this healthcare process first ensure that the american people with preexisting conditions have access to coverage second ensure a stable transition for americans currently enrolled in the exchanges third provide more equitable tax treatment through tax credits for people who already dont receive taxadvantage healthcare from their employer and i know  something that secretary price was talking about  for the vast number of people who get their insurance through their employer theyre getting it tax free they are not taxed on that benefit which is something that is not afforded to people who are in the individual market who either run a small business or are sole proprietorsfourth we should expand the power of health savings accounts to return control to americans over their healthcare dollar and decisions they should be able to choose the plan they want not the plan thats forced on them by government and finally we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with medicare to make sure that no one is left out this is the obamacare replacement plan that everyone has been asking for the plan that the president ran on and the plan that will ultimately save the system its also a culmination of years of dedicated work and careful thought by republicans to find a replacement that will best undo the damage thats been caused by obamacare while ensuring that all americans have peace of mind during this stable transition periodthese are the principles for which conservatives have been fighting for for years president trump looks forward to continuing the dialogue between the administration and the hill on saving the healthcare systemwhats important to remember is that were not going to be able to do all of this on one bill as the secretary mentioned there are two other steps as well that allow us to get more of the presidents plan accomplished after we pass this first important major stepthe second piece is already underway and thats what secretary price can do through executive action he has already rolled out a handful of important actions including the major marketplace stabilization regulation to help bring stability to the collapsing insurance market hell continue to enact a number of policy changes in the regulatory and administration space  administrative space to achieve what the first step cannot because of the nature of reconciliationthe third piece of executing the presidents healthcare plan is on  requires  votes in legislation maybe more depending on what we can do and when thats how well move forward on the policies of purchasing across state lines lowering drug prices  that just came up  and repealing any of obamacares premiumspiking insurance market distortions that cant be done through this current billalso yesterday in addition to speaking with israeli prime minister netanyahu the president also had separate calls with prime minister of japan abe and south koreas acting president hwang during both of these calls the president reiterated the united states ironclad commitment to stand with japan and south korea in the face of the serious threat posed by north koreahe also

forfeiture ever levied by the us government in such a casethis settlement tells the world that the days of flouting the us sanctions regime or violating us trade laws are overpresident trump is committed to ending the disrespect of american laws and american workersso back to the schedule for a second this morning the president also received his daily intelligence briefing he had lunch with

but first next week chancellor merkel of germany will visit the white house and the following week the president will welcome prime minister alabadi of iraq with that ill kick it off with your questions jonathan karlq  sean its been a full mr spicer jonathanq  thank you laughter sean its been a full mr spicer youre out of practiceq  i know laughter its been a full three days since the president said that president obama had his wires tapped his phones tapped at trump tower in those three days has the white house come up with any evidence whatsoever to prove that allegationmr spicer i addressed this multiple times yesterday i think the president  we put out a statement on sunday saying that we would have no further comment and we were asking the house and the senate intelligence committees to look into this concern and report backq  cant the president just ask the fbi director if this happened has he asked himmr spicer look i think  no the president has not and i think that weve gone back and forth with you guys  i think there is clearly a role that congress can play in its oversight capabilities theyve made it very clear that they have the staff the resources and the process i think thats the appropriate place for this to handle i think if we were to start to get involved you would then write stories about how we were getting involvedso its a nowin situation i think the smartest and most deliberative way to address this situation is to ask the house and senate intelligence committees who are already in the process of looking into this to look into this and other leaks of classified information that are troubling to our nations national securityso as the president said in the statement on sunday we believe that that investigation as well as the investigation of other classified leaks and other important information that threatens our national security be looked into by the house and senate intelligence committees and then we encourage them to report backq  do you believe that president obama ordered something like thismr spicer i get that thats a cute question to ask my job is to represent the president and to talk about what hes doing and what he wants and he has made very clear what his goal is what he would like to have happen and so ill just leave it at that i think weve tried to play this game before im not here to speak for myself im here to speak for the president of the united states and our governmentzekeq  sean one followup on what secretary price said earlier i think he was asked by john about whether the administration was willing to make a  for the american people right now who like their doctor or like their health insurance plan is the white house willing to make a commitment then today that when this replacement bill is passed if it passes that they will at the end of that be able to keep their doctor and keep their healthcare planand secondly just changing gears radically onto  china overnight issued some strong rhetoric promising consequences for the deployment of the thaad missile system to south korea if you could respond to thatmr spicer so on the first piece i think  look one of the things thats important to understand about this process thats very different from when the democrats did it  youll recall thenspeaker pelosi said youre going to have to read the bill to know whats in it i think theres a big differencethis is the bill its right here its on the website were going through regular order if you go to the house of representatives website speaker paul ryans website its listed everybody can read it and its going to go through what they call regular order were not jamming this down anybodys throat its going to go through a committee process all parties involved all representatives in the house will be able to have input into it i think thats the way to conduct this process is to do it to allow people to watch the process happen in the committees allow members of congress to have their input in it to make amendments to see that we get the best bill that achieves the goal for the american peoplewhen it was done the last time it was jammed down peoples throat and look what happened you had  pages that people struggled to read afterwards and figure out what had just gotten passed and the consequences were frankly devastatingso to your point about keeping your doctor in a lot of cases youve lost your doctor for a couple of reasons one they may not participate in the plan they may not take insurance at all anymore two they may not take medicaid  or three they may not take medicaid and the list goes on and on about why they might not be there  or your plan the plan that you got is no longer accessible as the secretary mentioned onethird of all counties in the united states no longer take medicaid  or excuse me have only one plan that you can choose from so its a fact right now that you  in most cases you have no choice in many cases youve lost that ability our goal is to actually add more choice and more competition right now the government tells you you must have this plan or you will pay a penalty and within this plan heres what you have to have weve lost the element of choice and competition in healthcare and by bringing all of that back i think theres a higher degree of likelihood that youre going to get the plan that you want and youre going to get the doctor you want because it will be your choice not the governments choiceand thats a big big difference this plan was jammed down everybodys throat and the consequences took their plans away it took their doctors away and it drove up costs this plan allows more competition more people to enter it and the american people and patients to make a decision on what plan they want if they have a plan and a doctor they like then theyre going to choose a plan that allows them to continue with that doctor but theres going to be more competition and more choice not less and thats frankly what you have now with respect to china i think i addressed this yesterday we stand shoulder to shoulder with japan and south korea in doing what we can to protect that region in particular from an attack from north korea we understand the situation and we continue to work with them as ive mentioned the president spoke to both leaders yesterday we provided a readout of those calls but we obviously understand the concerns of china but  this is a national security issue for themhunterq  thank you sean how concerned is the president with the situation between north korea and malaysia right nowmr spicer well as i said i think were very well aware of the  whats going on in the region the president obviously had a conversation with in particular the leader  the acting president of south korea last night with respect to whats going on there and again ill refer that to the national security committee to give you further  cheryl bolenq  thanks seanmr spicer cheryl i know sorry i forgot you yesterdayq  i appreciate it so two questions one on healthcare if the cbo scores this bill and it does not provide the amount of coverage that the affordable care act did will the president still support itmr spicer well im not going to get ahead  secretary price mentioned this  lets not get ahead of the cbo going through this but i think as i mentioned to zeke one of the things thats important to understand theres  this is  this bill has to be done in the phases that it has to to address the repeal part of it and the replace part of itthere are only certain things that we can do through reconciliation i know theres the regulatory piece that we can do through actions that the secretary is empowered to do frankly under obamacare and then third is an additional piece of legislation that addresses thingsbut there are costsaving measures that  and competition aspects of this that have to be included in phase two or three because theyre not allowed in the reconciliation bill because of the nature of how reconciliation works on capitol hillso i think that one of the things that we have to understand is that how that score comes out from the congressional budget office will depend on whether they look at it specifically with just a phase one or whether they look at it in its totality but im confident that if you look at whats going on right now cheryl its unsustainable premiums in state after state as dr price mentioned theyre up  percent on average arizona is  percent i think oklahoma is the s minnesota is in the s this is unsustainable for a family to continue to pay the premiums that they have and for individuals smallbusiness owners et ceteraso the question is can we allow people to go on this trajectory where more and more of their paycheck is getting eaten up in a plan thats frankly not giving them choice doctors or plans that they want this plan i think clearly achieves those goals a lot better it gets the price  cost containment down it gets price control under it and it allows doctors and plans to reengage in the marketplace as they were prior to this and i think that is a major aspect of ithold on cheryl waitedq  thank you from yesterday i had a nominations question is there something thats preventing the white house from submitting the nominations of sonny perdue for agriculture and alex acosta for labormr spicer i believe alex acosta was sent up to the hill earlier today we should have an announcement officially out so sometimes theres a little bit of a lag i apologize between my office and  but that one is up and ill check on sonny perdue i think some of it is just in coordination with the senate so pardon my timeq  thanks sean i have two questions for you first will the president offer a correction to his tweet this morning that states that  prisoners were released from gitmo by the obama administration and then returned to the battlefield can you take that firstmr spicer yes i mean obviously the president meant in totality the number that had been released on the battlefield  that have been released from gitmo since  individuals have been released so that is correctq  then my second question is the white house concerned about this new information that came out in wikileaks today that us intelligence agencies are potentially purposely providing vulnerabilities to tech products here in the united statesmr spicer im not going to comment on that i think obviously thats something that has not been fully evaluated and if it was i would not comment from here on thatkevinq  yes sean i was going to ask about branding the president in the past put his name on buildings and different products when it comes to healthcare does the white house feel that the bill presented today should be known as trumpcare from here on out i know it was asked of the secretary and at what point do you think that the transition should go away from obamacare to the new administrationmr spicer well as soon as its repealed we can get rid of that i think that will happen quicklyand as secretary price mentioned i think were less concerned with labels right now and more in terms of action and results and i think thats what our focus has been is getting that cost down getting that choice back that we mentioned yeahq  sean dhs is reportedly considering separating families that cross the border illegally how does the president feel about thatmr spicer im going to  thats a dhs matter we dont get involved in either customs or ice enforcement so i think thats a question better reserved to both dhs and ice specificallyjimq  oh thanks sean on the obamacare question one of the criticisms on this is that there is still a de facto individual mandate because it allows insurance companies to increase premiums up to  percent of people  if theres a gap in coverage and i have one more mr spicer well thats not  the difference is under the current bill thats here if you dont buy insurance you pay a fine under the current bill you dont have  theres nothing that mandates you to buy insurance thats up to an individual so by its very definition it is not  cant be considered thatwhats your second oneq  well you dont think its a de facto mandate in the sense of theres a penalty mr spicer it cant beq   in place as there is now not by the government but is by the insurance companiesmr spicer right but theres no  i think you answered your own question on that one q  i have one moremr spicer okayq  another topic the president has blamed the democrats in the senate for blocking the cabinet last thursday the republicans actually called a recess early  adjourned on thursday early previously they called a recess the week before does the president have any plans to call for the senate to remain in session and the congress to stay in session until they approve the nominees and maybe even also repeal obamacaremr spicer this isnt a republican issue i mean its not republicans that are playing beat the clock on a lot of these nominees and weve discussed this since the transition time there were several nominees that frankly werent even considered controversial by the standards of senate democratic leadership and yet have been held up over and over again i dont think  thats a very different scenario than going back and being with constituents which was on the senate schedule so i dont think  thats a synonymous thingdo we have michael medved ready to go for a skype question michaelq  yes hello sean thank you very much obviously today there was a big emphasis on obamacare which is profoundly important to the american people but it seems that too often in the last several weeks the administration has gotten distracted and media have gotten distracted by talk of wiretapping at trump tower or the president calling his predecessor a bad and sick guy or criticizing the ratings of celebrity apprentice do you think the white house could do a better job of focusing on the issues that really matter the reforms that matter to the american people rather than getting distracted to these subsidiary conflicts as we move forward into the coming monthsmr spicer thanks michael respectfully i would say that we have been focused were here talking about obamacare and the need to drive down the cost and access for healthcare for every american i think thats a pretty significant thing to be focused onyesterday we were talking about the presidents effort to continue to keep the nation safe to make sure that people arent coming into the country who arent here for peaceful purposes the president has talked to almost  world leaders hes had plus executive actions on all sorts of stuff from regulatory aspects to things that will create more jobs i think thats a fairly focused effortthat being said i think look whether it was candidate trump presidentelect trump or now president trump the president has always made it very clear  or not he made it clear but i think the voters made it clear that one of the things that they appreciate about him is his ability to be authentic and to speak very forcefully and very directly with the american people and thats an aspect that i think was central to why he was elected is because hes not a canned politician thats going to give the same staid answers over and over againsaraq  going back to freds question conservatives have started to call this obamacare lite but president trump has promised to fully repeal obamacare but this bill leaves a lot of the structure of obamacare intact if this is the policy that passes is president trump confident in the future he can say that he fully repealed obamacaremr spicer yeah absolutely as i mentioned the first half of the bill that we put forward repeals it there are three things i mean  each phase that weve talked about phase one phase two and phase three theres a repealandreplace aspect in each one but republicans and conservatives have been talking about adding competition and driving costs down for decades now selling across state lines smallbusiness pooling all of those things have been part of conservative plans for a long time and i think instilling that competition in it allowing more access  i think there is a big difference there is no  we have for the longest time  if youre a conservative you think about this right now that you have  anyone who has an employerbased  their job comes from an employer that gives them healthcare theyre getting a subsidy theyre getting a credit they dont pay taxes on their healthcare and their employer doesnt either thats a huge disadvantage to anyone who is a sole proprietor or owns a small business and so frankly to allow the playing field to be leveled and allow small businesses which are frankly the job creators in this country to allow entrepreneurs and selfstarters to get the same tax treatment that a fortune  company gets you is a very conservative principleand again look one of the things thats important sara is for all of the people who have concerns about this  especially on the right  look at the size this is the democrats this is us you cant get any clearer in terms of this is government this is notand i think that part of the reason the visual is important is that when you actually look at the difference you realize this is what big government does it crowds out competition it drives up prices it stifles entrepreneurship and innovation doctors leaving the markets more and more people not taking medicaid or tricare that should concern people when youve got veterans that cant  because most of the time medicaid and tricare are tied together so when you have those systems not accepted by doctors that means the lowest of our  people on the lowincome scale and people who have served our country have fewer and fewer choices that alone should be a problem and concerning for many people but the premium spikes are another problem because again even if youre in the exchange now youre seeing over and over again that happen youre also seeing young people decide that theyd rather just pay a penalty because the cost of those basic programs is out of reach for a lot of young people who are just entering the job marketbut again i think the greatest illustration of the differences in the approaches is that size our bill which is a tenth of the size does repeal and replace in what their bill just did in massive government bureaucracy and that is a big difference jimq  just want to ask you  i mean you had the health and human services secretary out here you just talked about this is the republican bill this is the democrat bill is that the presidents bill is that his healthcare billq  that is a bill that we have worked with with congress we feel very good about where it is we are looking forward  as i mentioned earlier the president is meeting with the whip team to encourage them to support it and to build it out i dont think  and im not trying to be cute here  but i think its not his bill or their bill its a bill that we have worked on with them together were very proud of where it stands nowthe big difference jim is that unlike before as i mentioned when the democrats jammed it down peoples throat and said  waited to get that th vote with senator kennedy still around and then basically said literally you will have to wait and see what it looks like before we passed it  we not only posted it out there for everybody to look at but by sending it through regular order not just putting it up for a house vote but sending it through the committee process allows republicans democrats and independents alike to offer up amendments and suggestions and the house will work its willnow we will continue to give guidance and thoughts and suggestions but i think the presidents core principles are whats going to guide us as we head through the hill and then  the house and then to the senateq  and just one quick followup on jonathan karls question because the president made a very serious allegation over the weekend and i think we would all be remiss if we went through this briefing and not tried to get you on camera to at least offer us some evidence where is the evidence where is the proof that president obama bugged president trumpmr spicer well i answered this question yesterday on camera on your air so just so were clear  i know this is now  it will be twice but i think i made it clear yesterday q  but since yesterday since yesterday mr spicer nothing has changedq   is there any new proof mr spicer no and its not a question of new proof or less proof or whatever the answer is the same which is that i think that there is a concern about what happened in the  election the house and senate intelligence committees have the staff and the capabilities and the processes in place to look at this in a way thats objective and thats where it should be done and frankly if youve seen the response from  especially on the house side but as well as the senate they welcome thisand so lets let the senate do their job and the house  excuse me  intelligence committees and then report back to the american peopleq  will the president withdraw the accusation does he have any mr spicer why would he withdraw it until its adjudicated thats what were asking is for them to look at this and see if there is q  no regrets with him about raising this accusationmr spicer no absolutely not and i think that what he wants them to do is to look into wiretapping other surveillance and again as i mentioned before the other leaks that are threatening our national security youre seeing the leaks happen over and over again that come out throughout the administration throughout government and undermine national security and i think the appropriate thing to do is to ask the house and the senate to look into itglenn thrushq  to follow up on a followup in terms of  you were given the opportunity on air to say whether or not the president still supported director comey does the president support director comey and i have a quick followupmr spicer i have no reason to believe he doesnt he has not suggested that to me so now to the nonfollowup to the q  have you seen any evidence yourself has the evidence been shared with you or other senior members of the presidents staff as to why he made this particular accusationmr spicer as far as me no im not in a position that that would be regularly part of my daily duties for the president to sit down and go through that thats probably a level above my pay grade but as ive mentioned i think the president believes that the appropriate place for this to be adjudicated is for the house and senate intelligence committees who have the clearances the staff the processes to go through this look at it and report backq  did he share it with mr spicer im not going to get in  as the president made very clear glenn q   with his national security advisormr spicer as the president said in the statement that he issued on sunday were not going to have further comment on this until this matter is resolvedyesq  two quick questions so just to follow up on the followup so does the white house feel that its appropriate  you say that you want it to be adjudicated by the congressional committees but the president made declarative statements on twittermr spicer rightq  so i guess is the white house position that the president can make declarative statements about a former president basically committing a crime and then the congressional committees should look into that and basically prove it i mean how does that exactly mr spicer i take issue with  its not a question of prove it i think as i said now five times to a followup to a followup that its not a question of prove it its that they have the resources and the clearances and the staff to fully and thoroughly and comprehensively investigate this and then issue a report as to what their findings are q  but president trumps twitter statement shouldnt be taken at face value about what mr spicer sure it should of course it  i mean why no theres nothing  as i mentioned to jim its not that hes walking anything back or regretting hes just saying that they have the appropriate venue and capabilities to review thismargaret im sorryq  so on the obamacare replacement so you said that it will be in phases and that youre going to need additional legislation so just to clarify are the cost savings that you guys are projecting is that dependent on phase three of the national competition plan because if thats the case then  mr spicer yeah well its not dependent i think that in order to see it fully come to fruition yeah you have to see all parts of it but the way that it was passed doesnt allow for  the way that it was passed is almost the same way that were going through this now which is they pass certain things then the secretary of health and human services at the time was granted significant regulatory authority that allowed her to do certain things at the time to implement pieces of obamacare that we now have to act backwards and go almost in the same steps to do what they did to lay it out weve got to repeal it and then weve got to replace it with the plan thats going to do the samecertain things can be done in the same way and certain things cant it just  it literally depends on how that was donejohn frederickq  sean in the replacement plan it says that the states that accepted the medicare expansion money would continue to be funded so what is the message you have to republican state legislators that thought they were fiscally responsible in rejecting medicaid expansion in their states and now they didnt get the federal dollars on either end what is your response to themmr spicer i think what we need to do is to make sure as the president said in his statements as secretary price did weve got to make sure that we continue to protect people through this transition process let the bill work its way but this is the first time  as we address the medicaid portion of this this is probably the first time that weve really addressed an entitlement aspect of something in almost  years so i think weve got to let this piece of it work its way through the housebut there is  remember one of the things that happened through the medicaid expansion was the goal has always been about medicaid to help people who were disabled or poor or met a specific number of criteria for the first time in obamacare we expanded obamacare  or the obama administration did rather  to ablebodied individuals that  in a way that had never been done before and it was not a specific class thats led largely to the ballooning costi think a lot of the reforms that will be contained in this bill will address that but i think weve got to let it work its will through the processalexisq  sean i want to ask you two communications questions on two topics because the president gave himself a middling grade on communication let me ask you about the experience that the previous administration had when obamacare was going through its own phases the president  president obama said that the opposition to the legislation was able to seize the opportunity while it was being legislated to create public perceptions about what was in the legislation so my question is on aca what is the president going to do to improve his communications to be out there explaining what is in the bill to work with lawmakers thats the first question and then ill ask you the next onemr spicer okay thank you so on the first one as ive mentioned hes had and continues to have significant outreach to members of congress hes talked to health insurers i mean i think weve read out a lot of the activities of the last couple weeks and literally in just  within an hour hes going to sit down with the house deputy whip team to talk about the legislative piece of this in the houseso this is going to be a very aggressive laserlike focus of this administration over the next month or two to get this thing through the house and then moved over to the senate but theres a big difference alexis what were doing is vastly different they were expanding government promising people something and i think whats happened is there was a lot of difference with how they approach it right now the american people no matter where you are you understand the state of your healthcare the costs that youre seeing and the lack of choice that youve now been presented with and in many cases you realize that when you go in to see the doctor or a loved one is going to see a doctor that theyre not getting  theyre not either able to get in theyre not taking the medicare or the exchange insurance that they got the costs are going out of control and i think its really interesting  i mean one of the things that dr price mentioned that is so apropos of this is having a card does not mean you have insurance its like handing someone a blank check  it doesnt mean that you have money it means you have a check and i think what weve seen over the last few years with obamacare is you can have an insurance card but that doesnt mean someone is going to take it and it sure doesnt mean that its going to be affordable and theres a big difference between having a card and having healthcare thats affordable and thats the difference that were trying to solve right now so when it comes to communication i think one of the things thats really helpful is that part of the sell is done for us the american people understand the state of their healthcare they understand how much theyre paying for theyve gone to see a doctor or gone to a hospital or had a notice from their carrier saying we are no longer part of this or their employer says hey whatever your particular carrier is is no longer available were switching you into this and so for so many americans healthcare is a very very real part of their daily experience because theyre caring for themselves theyre dealing with an ailment or dealing with children or a loved one or someone else in their family where theyre seeing firsthand the devastation and disaster that obamacare has caused them in their personal life so i think theres a welcoming of this effort and i think its a lot easier for us to go in  because we dont have to explain the problem people are living it and i think for them to understand what were giving you is more choice greater competition were incentivizing more people to be part of the process and were going to be driving down the cost of those premiumsyou had a secondq  my second question on communications has to do with the presidents assertion about the wiretapping because the white house wants this now to be handled by the legislative branch and in confidence and in classification can we count on the president to himself while this investigation is going on to cease and desist using twitter or any other public venue to make accusations that are in public but he will not respond to in publicmr spicer with respect to this particular situation ill ask that and ill get back to you on thatjohn gizziq  thank you sean just getting back to the question about if one likes his or her healthcare they can keep it in  congressman fred upton then chairman of the house energy committee offered legislation that put precisely those words into law and it received the votes of every republican member in the house and between  and  democrats and then it died in the senate would the administration support a revival of the upton amendment in other words putting the right to keep ones healthcare plan and doctor if he or she liked it todaymr spicer i mean i think thats the goal i dont want to start talking about what were going to  as we go through the process weve now put our stamp on this and sent it to the house it will work its will as amendments come up through regular order our team will weigh in on those with their staff and again the president is meeting with the whip team todayi dont want to start saying were going to support this amendment or that amendment now but i think generally speaking obviously the goal is to make sure that people get a plan that they like thats affordable that meets what they need to have met that they shouldnt have to have a onesizefitsall governmentinstilled healthcare system that doesnt offer any choice or frankly isnt tailored to the needs that they have i think thats an important thingjohnq  sean right now youre two votes short of passing repealandreplace in the senate because youve got four republican senators who are saying they cant support the bill because of rolling back the medicaid expansion what do you say to those senators who are very concerned that people will lose coverage that this does not provide enough stability for those people who rely on medicaid for their healthcaremr spicer well theres two things john one is were at day one were going to go through the house first so weve got a little bit of time and i think as we go through that process these senators  and not just the additional two but i think and hope that well get additional ones  they recognize that those people as ive said over and over again here  if we do nothing theyre going to be in a very very worse scenario than they are nowmore and more people  if youre on medicaid which serves so many lowincome americans as i mentioned they have a card and that card does not allow them to go to doctor after doctor who are saying were not going to take medicaid or tricare anymore so i would ask those senators what are you doing to help us work on a bill that will get them insured again because for too many americans theyve got a card but they dont have insurance and i think thats a very very big thing to  a distinction to maketheyre the ones who have the problem right now theyve got a medicaid card and nowhere to go and what we need to do is to make sure that lowincome americans veterans small business owners individuals who desperately need healthcare have options and affordabilityq  one other piece of this you could bring down the cost of the insurance itself through efficiencies in the system selling across state lines but the biggest driver of the increase in health insurance cost is the skyrocketing cost of medicine what in this overall plan do you propose to do to either cap the rise or even bring it downmr spicer well i think you  the secretary mentioned this but i mean the cost of prescription drugs is q  thats one small mr spicer no its not its a big factor i think that q  but when youre paying  out of pocket to get a stent i mean its mr spicer again what is the biggest thing missing q   but its getting out of controlmr spicer fair enough but q  fair enough drugs is one part of it but  huge other part of itmr spicer okay when you talk about procedures or drugs the biggest thing thats missing in this whole equation is competition i mean were down to one plan in many places theres nothing for these places to compete q  theres plenty of competition between hospitalsmr spicer no theres  i mean thats fine but if they know theyre going to get the same reimbursement rate if they know that theres no other options that plans arent trying to get people  then thats a big difference right now theres a lack of competition in the industry and i think one of the presidents  i get it may be one part of that but youre right that allover medicine  procedures and such  theres a reason he met with drug executives and talked about getting those costs down that theres a multifaceted approach and how do we instill competition how do we drive down costs but youre right weve got to do more to get the cost of that down of the procedures to allow additional options everything that is  its the same way that again  think about your insurance one of the things that was driving up cost in the past was people were exercising the option of going to an emergency room over and over again for their primary care and what happened is that you saw all of these clinics pop up from around and insurance carriers actually made it cheaper in terms of copays to go see that than an emergency room driving people to somewhere that didnt continue to drive up cost clog insurance that competition alone starts saving the plans money and helping to keep cost down weve got to instill more aspects of competition in medicinejenniferq  sean can you give us an update on the effort to roll back regulations have the taskforce  regulatory reform taskforces identified any regulations to roll back and have any actually been repealedmr spicer i think that they have had their work cut out for them theyve started as they  the president has met with different industries and companies corporations associations that is a constant subject of discussion which is those regulatory aspects of our economy that are keeping companies from growing expanding and hiring and so i know that the domestic policy team and others have been working on that and if i can get further updates on specific legislation or excuse me specific regulatory action ill get back to youhallieq  thanks sean two topics for you im trying to get some clarity on something that my colleagues have tried to follow up on as well youve said that the president stands by his tweets saturday morning that president obama ordered this wiretap youve also said that the administration wants congress  let me just be clear  he found out this information youve also said that the president wants congress to investigate some members of congress by the way have asked the white house and asked the president to come forward with that information so bottom line why would the president want congress to investigate for information he already hasmr spicer i think theres a separationofpowers aspect here as i mentioned to jonathan that we think its q  talk about resources and time  why waste thatmr spicer well its not a question of waste it its a question of appropriateness q  but if the president has the info sean  and i guess thats what im trying to get to  if hes sitting on this information that he found out hes now directing or asking or recommending that the intelligence committees look into this and you talked about they have resources and staff which they do but why expend those resources and staff if the president found out this information and has itmr spicer i think theres a difference between directing the department of justice which may be involved in an ongoing investigation and asking congress as a separate body to look into something and add credibility to the look  adds an element that wouldnt necessarily be there if we were directing the department of justice for example but again i think weve made it very clear how he wants this done and where we go from thereq  second question then millions of americans are working on their tax returns right now will the president commit to releasing his tax returns for this year and is he still under audit for his past returnsmr spicer my understanding is hes still under audit and ill follow up on the questionq  question and quick followup how do you understand what weve seen on the growing number of cases at the canadian border of canadians born and raised in canada with valid passports being stopped at the border and told just to go back they wont let them come in and  in the usmr spicer im not aware of that i think thats something that probably should be addressed to the department of homeland securityq  do you think there might be a misunderstanding of the messages sent on the immigration mr spicer i dont know i think its a good question that is probably best directed towards the department of homeland security dr swanq  thank you is the white house going to keep its promise to withdraw from the paris climate agreement and our understanding is that there is some divisions of opinion  rex tillerson wants to stay in steve bannon wants to get out whats going on will you keep the promise if not why notmr spicer i think thats something id be glad to follow up with you and everyone i dont have anything on that right now im aware of the discussion of it so let me  if i can ill get back to youmikeq  i have an unrelated question but i also want to follow up on something mr spicer unrelated questions are my favorite laughterq  you talked about the communications strategy will the president play a public role in selling this bill will he speak to the public about it will he answer questions about itmr spicer thats a good question i think that we are going to have a very comprehensive strategy as i mentioned just a few minutes from now the president is going to engage with members of the house whip team to talk to them q   talking to members of congress  mr spicer i understand that but  and i understand that this is step one theres a lot of time  as i mentioned we expect to be dealing with this for the next several weeks there will be plenty of opportunities for the president to speak about that to engage with the public but its going to be a comprehensive plan that we will discusswe had i cant even begin to tell you how many administration folks members of congress flooding the broadcast and radio airwaves today both nationally and in local markets we were very very active throughout the country getting out the word on what were doing and why were doing it from national broadcast shows to cable to  i mean to radio we had a very very aggressive start to this effort were working with the house in particular were continuing to start really engaging with the senate but this is going to be a comprehensive effort working with the house and the senate to get this thing done and other partners  doctors and outside groups that share this concern as i mentioned earlier to one of the other folks theres a need by companies and corporations who are feeling the weight of additional cost to join us in this effort and i just want  this is obviously something that needs to get dealt with the escalating costs are having a significant impact not just on our economy but on the ability of people to get hired or frankly people who are hired leave their job because the cost of healthcare is not allowing especially people in the small and mediumsized businesses to keep up with those costswith that thank you guys very much i look forward to seeing you q   meeting tomorrow  congressmen coming to the meeting with the presidentmr spicer well have a readout q  sean i have that unrelated question which was mr spicer im sorry thats not fair mike gets his unrelated questionq  and answer mine after that pleaseq  will the trump administration continue the obama administrations practice of releasing publicly the visitor logsmr spicer were currently evaluating our procedures on that and well have some  and when we have an announcement ill let you knowand april ill have a readout on our schedule for tomorrow later q  hes meeting tomorrow with mr spicer once its confirmed i will let you know first and then everybody else thank you guys have a great dayend pm est

2017-03-07,Remarks by President Trump and Representative Steve Scalise in Meeting with the U.S. House Deputy Whip Team , pm estthe president thank you everybody and mike pence is going to be here in a few minutes we miss mike when hes not around laughterso i want to thank the members of the house deputy whip team it will be very important over the next number of months we have a great team and were going to have a lot of victories a lot of wins but we have a great teamtogether were going to do incredible things for the great citizens of our country as i said during my joint address to congress  and i think you mostly liked that right laughterparticipant we loved that laughterparticipant we liked it a lot laughterthe president were witnessing a renewal of the american spirit a surge of optimism and a new national pride which is sweeping across the land i see it  theres such spirit whether its for the business things were doing or whatever its such spirit that we havent seen in the country in a long time jobs are pouring back here you saw what happened with exxon where they just announced a massive job program so were going to have some funnow we have to remember obamacare is collapsing and its in bad shape and were going to take action theres going to be no slowing down theres going to be no waiting and no more excuses by anybody were all now  i can probably say im a politician laughter okay i am a politician but were going to get it done and youre the leaders that really will get it done for all of us and for the american people obamacare is in very bad shape i believe that if we wait two years it will totally implode its really pretty much imploding now steve when you think but it will implode and people will be like please help us please help us and that will be the democrats asking for help they already are asking for help in the true sense of the word because its a disaster the insurance companies are fleeing some states are up over  percent in costs the deductibles are through the roof  you dont even get to use itso were going to do something thats great and im proud to support the replacement plan released by the house of representatives and encouraged by members of both parties i think really that were going to have something thats going to be much more understood and much more popular than people can even imagine it follows the guidelines i laid out in my congressional address  a plan that will lower costs expand choices increase competition and ensure healthcare access for all americans this will be a plan where you can choose your doctor this will be a plan where you can choose your plan laughter and you know what the plan is  this is the plan and were going to have a tremendous  i think were going to have a tremendous success its a complicated process but actually its very simple its called good healthcare so i want to thank you folks for being with us today ladies and gentlemen and we will do something really really important and really good for the american people i think its going to go very quickly i hope its going to go very quickly and as you know after that we work on the tax cut were going to be planning a major tax cut i know exactly what were looking at  most of us know exactly the plan its going to put our country in great shape and were going to reduce taxes for companies and for people and i can use the word again  massively its going to be a big tax cut the biggest since reagan maybe bigger than reaganso i look forward  i really look forward to working on that but we cant really get to that unfortunately because of the way your system works we cant get to that until we take care of healthcare so well take care of the healthcare i appreciate your great support and lets get it done thank you thank you all fantastic thank yourepresentative scalise well mr president thank you for having our deputy whip team to the white house and thank you for your commitment on following through on what to most americans is probably one of the most important promises that was made not only by you but by all of us in getting this majority  both in the house and senate  and the white house and that is rescuing the american people from the failures of obamacare weve heard the message for years weve seen the dramatically skyrocketing costs youre seeing doubledigit increases every year in most part of the country in health premiums for families many families are seeing deductibles that rise about the  range which means people dont have access to healthcare people dont have the ability to choose their own doctoryou talked about this the other night in just one of the best speeches ive heard from a president standing at that well in the house chamber when you addressed the joint session and gave an inspirational speech to the country laying out the things that need to happen and that youre going to do to get this country back on track and to create jobs and to secure americabut one of the things you talked about is how its wrong that unelected bureaucrats in washington have the ability to tell you what you can and cant buy for your family in healthcare one of the most personal decisions families makethis bill finally starts the process of not only repealing obamacare but also replacing it with reforms that put patients back in charge of their healthcare decisions that lower costs for families let them actually choose the decisions between them and their doctor which are so personaland so as we start this process the people in this room the chief deputy whips are the ones that are going to be working directly with members to ultimately pass this bill to your desk so that we can quickly provide that relief from obamacare to the people of the united states and i know we are honored to have our former house colleague and now our vice president of the united states who has been involved in this fight from the beginning as well vice president mike pence joining us toothank you mr vice presidentthe president well thank you very much steve and again were going to work quickly its a great bill were going to have  i really believe were going to have tremendous support im already seeing the support  not only in this room im seeing it from everybody and im seeing it from the public and they want obamacare overi got elected to a certain extent  i would say a pretty good little chunk  based on the fact repeal and replace obamacare and many of you people are in the same boat very important so lets get it donethank you all very much for being here thank you okay thank you end pm est

2017-03-03,"Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders En Route Orlando, Florida ",aboard air force oneen route orlando florida  pm estms sanders all right ill walk through  ill keep the opening quick since i know were on tight time but the president is going to spend his day here in orlando florida speaking with students parents teachers and administrators on how we can improve our education system and the importance of school choice well be at the st andrew catholic school the president will then proceed to palm beach for a working weekend and returning on sunday night to the white housethe vice president will be wisconsin today for a listening session with wisconsin business leaders and their employees and attending with him are secretary price and speaker ryan also attending with the president today in florida secretary devos florida governor rick scott and senator marco rubio who is also on the plane with us today  as well as secretary devosand with that i will take your questionsq  is there any reaction from the white house to arrests in connection with the threats against jewish community centersms sanders is there any what im sorryq  reaction from the white house to the arrestsms sanders i know that happened just within the last few hours and so i will get back to you on that if theres anything specific from us but right now its still too early for us to say much about it let the process workq  can you see why the white house decided that its okay for the keystone xl pipeline not to be built with american steelms sanders well the way that the executive order is written is actually  and ill get you the exact language but you can probably all have it in your inboxes if you want to look back but its specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired and since this one is already currently under construction the steel is already literally sitting there it would be hard to go back but i know that everything moving forward would be  fall under that executive orderq  vice president pence in a new story out of indiana  it was revealed that he used a private email server ms sanders actually it was q   or a private email account ms sanders very differentq  sorry a private email account but it was hacked how is that different from what hillary clinton did whats the differencems sanders theres lightyears of difference number one he was a governor  he wasnt a federal employee which means the laws are different its subject to indiana law not federal law second hes a governor which means he wasnt handling classified information like she was and third all of his emails he turned over specifically to be archived which is why anybody even knows about the account he did everything to the letter of the law in indiana turned all of his emails over unlike hillary clinton who lost at least  who knows how many more had a private server and had classified information which he didnt have i mean thats an applestooranges comparisonq  sarah on russia and sessions is the president ms sanders i cant believe it took us that longq  i know rightms sanders goodnessq  is the president satisfied that recusal is enough for the attorney general he seemed to say in his statement he didnt even think that that should have happened and yet the attorney general took that step on his own and there are reports about other members of the presidents campaign staff that had also had connections ms sanders campaign volunteers but yesq   who have been volunteers i mean at what point is there a there there as sean said there wasnt i mean at what point is  i mean theres so much out therems sanders is there really i mean please explain to me how volunteers meeting at a conference where nearly  ambassadors attended is a story i guess that part is kind of lost on me where that would be newsworthy in any capacity i mean chuck schumer sitting having drinks with putin and thats not a news story but apparently a volunteer for a campaign bumping into one at a conference where theres again dozens of other ambassadors is newsworthy i guessq  jeff sessions was more than a campaign volunteer rightms sanders as a senator he obviously in his official capacity met with the ambassador but again that was a senator not as a campaign official and so to try to muddy the waters in that way is i think pretty unfair to the attorney general q  why is the administration just now telling people about the meeting with kislyak at trump tower it seems like a little late given that there was all this stuff about whether flynn had had conversations with himms sanders look i think this again was a courtesy meeting they were part of over a hundred different meetings during the transition this wasnt like a secret  it was just  frankly i didnt know about it and so i dont think anybody saw it as a big deal there was no policy discussion it was an introductory courtesy meeting which we did literally hundreds over the course of the transitionq  with other ambassadors how many other ambassadorsms sanders i would have to get a specific number but i know that there were dozens of other ambassadorsq  there were a number of reporters who are staked out at trump tower watching people go up the elevators no one saw the russian ambassador did he use a separate entrance and if so whyms sanders im not sure but ill check and find out and let you guys knowq  to go back to pence and the email issue for a second is the white house certain that hes not using personal email as vice president and has the white house sort of checked in with all the cabinet secretaries and people to talk to them about using personal email versus government emailms sanders yeah i know that weve all had the training on security and ethics training and im also  i will ask specifically that question but i know that the vice president is following the law as its required by himq  can you say one thing on the education event today  nancy devos and her q  betsyq  im sorry  betsy devos sorry and her support for school choice has obviously been controversial with teachers unions with a lot of the democrats is this a sort of kickoff for the president in his push to try to help her adopt school choice nationwidems sanders i think the point of today is exactly what it says  its a listening session its to talk about ideas and reforms that have worked particularly at this school which i think you guys will get the opportunity to see that look the numberone priority for education with the president has been consistent from day one it hasnt changed and thats to make the power and the central focus be more on the parents and the local level and less at the federal level and today is part of that processq  is there any legislation or anything that he is going to pushing on thatms sanders not as of today well certainly keep you guys posted if were making any legislative announcements or bill signingsq  there are reports that german chancellor angela merkel is visiting the white house later this month can you confirm that todayms sanders yes she will be there i believe the date is march th and that is confirmedq  what will they be discussingms sanders im not going to get ahead of their conversations but well certainly provide readouts after that meeting and i believe we plan to have a press conference with that and they can address that directlyq  the new york times story about the debate over climate change and the paris climate deal whether the president is going to pull the us out of that deal  can you tell us where the presidents mind is on that and if were expecting an announcement anytime soonms sanders again im not going to get ahead of the president and he hasnt made an announcement on that but you guys are always the first to knowq  can you talk a little bit about the rnc event tonight what the president is going to do or say there and anything else that hes going to do this weekendms sanders sure i know that its a fundraiser this will be the first fundraiser he has attended as president and its  as you would imagine  like pretty much every other fundraiser the goal is to raise money for the republican party and i dont expect tonight to be any differentq  is there any access for usms sanders i dont think so as of now i think the standard policy has usually been not to have press at fundraisers but ill check and let you guys know q  and anything else this weekendms sanders i know we have some other stuff stephanie who will be with you guys through the rest of the weekend will keep you posted throughout sundayq  any update on the travel ban eoms sanders we dont have an announcement yet but again well let you know when were ready to roll that outq  any portions of his schedule for next week that you can preview todayms sanders i think we will have a weekahead guidance later tonight and so well get that to you guys thenanything elseq  more on sessions and russia the president said he learned about this as the rest of us were learning through media reports same thing with flynn he didnt know about the calls and the fact that they were discussing sanctions does the president feel like he has a full understanding of what his campaign what his staffers what his administration has done in terms of its relationship with russia is there anything that the president feels that he doesnt know yetms sanders i dont think so and i think the big point here is that the president himself knows what his involvement was and thats zero and i think hes the primary person that should be held responsible and he had no interaction and i think thats what the story should be focused onthanks guysq  thank you sarahms sanders you betend  pm est

2017-02-27,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/27/2017, #17 ",james s brady briefing room pm estmr spicer wow thats a crowd i hope everyone had a great weekend good afternoon before i begin i wanted to introduce the director of the office of management and budget mick mulvaney to talk to you a bit about the presidents budget when director mulvaney is finished we will allow him to take a few questions and then resume the briefing and all the fun that goes with itso without any further ado director mulvaneydirector mulvaney thanks very much i want to talk for a few minutes about the budget blueprint that most of you know the president started speaking about this morning with the governors ill talk a little bit about what it is and what it isnt and then talk about where we are in the budget process and what it looks like from herefirst of all what this isnt this is not a fullblown budget that will not come until may so youre not going to see anything in here that has to do with mandatory spending entitlement reforms tax policies revenue projections or the infrastructure plan this blueprint was never going to be that as i made clear during my senate confirmation it is a topline number onlyas for what it is these are the presidents policies as reflected in topline discretionary spending to that end it is a true americafirst budget it will show the president is keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do when he ran for office it prioritizes rebuilding the military including restoring our nuclear capabilities protecting the nation and securing the border enforcing the laws currently on the books taking care of vets and increasing school choice and it does all of that without adding to the currently projected fy  deficitthe top line defense discretionary number is  billion thats a billion increase  its one of the largest increases in history its also the number that allows the president to keep his promise to undo the military sequester the topline nondefense number will be  billion thats a billion savings its the largestproposed reduction since the early years of the reagan administrationthe reductions in nondefense spending follow the same model  its the president keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do it reduces money that we give to other nations it reduces duplicative programs and it eliminates programs that simply dont work the bottom line is this the president is going to protect the country and do so in exactly the same way that every american family has had to do over the last couple years and thats prioritize spending the schedule from here  these numbers will go out to the agencies today in a process that we describe as passback review from agencies are due back to omb over the course of the next couple days and well spend the next week or so working on a final budget blueprint we expect to have that number to congress by march th that puts us on schedule for a full budget  including all the things i mentioned this one does not include  with all the larger policy issues in the first part of may so with that ill take a couple questionsyes sirq  mr director in order to get to your topline on the rest of the nondiscretionary  or rest of the discretionary budget if youre not going to touch veterans benefits you need to slice about  percent off of the rest of government cant you do that without affecting the services the government provides for director mulvaney and thats part of what this process is this week the numbers go out and the numbers  each agency will get its topline number along with recommendations from omb as to how we think they can hit that number and they may come back to us and say yeah we think thats a good way to reach that number or they may come back to us with other suggestions thats what this process isi think its fairly unusual for us to be coming to you this early in the process but we wanted to let everybody know exactly where we wereq  but were not talking about  or  percent  were talking about doubledigit reductions and thats a lotdirector mulvaney theres going to be a lot of programs that  again you can expect to see exactly what the president said he was going to do foreign aid for example  the president said were going to spend less money overseas and spend more of it here thats going to be reflected in the number we send to the state departmentq  thank you very much one quick follow on foreign aid that accounts for less than  percent of overall spending and i just spoke with an analyst who said even if you zero that out it wouldnt pay for one year of the budget increases that are being proposed right now so how do you square that amount so why not tackle entitlements which are the biggest driver especially when a lot of republicans over the years have said that they need to be taxeddirector mulvaney sure on your foreign aid its the same answer i just gave which is yes its a fairly part of the discretionary budget but its still consistent with what the president said when you see these reductions youll be able to tie it back to a speech the president gave or something the president has said previously hes simply going to  we are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars so we will be spending less overseas and spending more back home i forgot your second questionq  on entitlements why not address entitlements which is the biggest driver of spendingdirector mulvaney its very unusual to  this is a budget blueprint  what some folks used to call a skinny budget  and it would not be at all unusual for larger policy decisions including tax reform revenue projections not to be included in this budget that will come in q  down the lineq  sir q  hold on so down the line could we see some type of budget that deals with entitlementsdirector mulvaney the full budget will contain the entire spectrum of the presidents proposed policy changesq  director on rebuilding the military can you talk a little bit about more of the breakdown of that can you go into a little bit more detaildirector mulvaney no i cant  because again where we are in this process is that the numbers going to the dod today and over the course of the next  days to two weeks well be coming up with those types of detailsive got time for one moreq  will you be asking the military  youre going to increase the military budget but are you going to at least ask the people in the defense department to take a look at their budget and say hey where can we at least cut or at least look and make sure that were spending the right amount of money is part of that is going to be part of the processdirector mulvaney well absolutely thats part of what secretary mattis and i have already talked hes interested in driving more efficiencies into the defense department omb is also going to be involved with him on the procurement process all of that will be incorporated in our larger budget in mayq  so its not just like a blanket  here were going to throw money at you do what you wantdirector mulvaney no sir no sirlast oneq  does this account for spending for the presidents wall either in the  billion weve heard youre going to request for this year or the  billion increase does that include money for the wall how to pay for the walldirector mulvaney it would be more likely  excuse me a little bit of both we do expect to include some money in a future supplemental for  for the wall and a  budget will also contain some longerterm dollars for thatq  so it will be split up between the twodirector mulvaney i believe that to be the casethank you all very muchmr spicer thank you directorso let me get back to  ill be right there in a second april this morning the president dropped by the national governors association meeting where  governors from both states and territories joined cabinet members and senior white house staff to discuss where they can work together to rebuild the country and restart the economywhile at the meeting the president delivered a statement on his forthcoming budget proposal which hell submit march th as you just heard the director mention the presidents budget will first and foremost keep americans safe that means investing in both our nations physical and financial security we will rebuild the nations military an increase in defense spending including increased funding for our veterans and our border will be matched by equal reductions in nondefense programs the savings in our budget will come from looking at outdated and duplicative programs the reductions spending will be sensible and rational but they will also be tough with our nations debt spiraling out of control we simply must take a look at the way were spending taxpayers dollars families across the country are being forced to make difficult choices because for too long the federal government has not treated their money with the respect they deserve the national debt exploded under the last administration from  billion trillion on january th  to  trillion the day before  sorry those are both trillions  the day before the presidents  president trumps inaugural every child born in america this year will inherit an average of over  in debt and that frankly is too muchour budget will restore respect for taxpayers dollars while funding all the necessary programs to keep our country safe and prospering this meeting with the governors was a continuation of a weekend of engagement and discussion between the governors and the administration the president and the first lady welcomed the governors last night to the white house for the annual governors ball and yesterday the vice president had a very productive meeting with several governorsthe administration is proud to be working with the governors on rebuilding our nations infrastructure reforming our healthcare system and putting americans back to work i know that obamacare in particular was put into place without a lot of input from governors were committed to consulting and including them on this and so many other subjects as we solve the nations biggest issues togetherlater this morning the president had a listening session with some of our countrys leading healthcare insurance companies interestingly on yesterdays abc this week minority leader pelosi actually laid out a great outline of how to judge obamacares success based on what it was supposed to achieve she said it had three goals one to lower the cost the other to expand benefits and the third to improve and increase accessso lets go through her criteria lowering costs while this year all four tiers of obamacare insurance plans are facing doubledigit increases in average premiums just to take a look at one set of premiums for standard silver plans in the states  percent increase in tennessee  percent increase in oklahoma and a staggering  percent increase in arizonaon expanding benefits in reality the new laws mandates have led to max cancellations of coverage soaring outofpocket costs and declining enrollment figures millions are choosing to pay a tax over buying

today to defeat isis this plan has been delivered by secretary mattis who is currently briefing the principals on the option presented today in seeking their input and feedbackfinally i wanted to note the president continues to be deeply disappointed and concerned by the reports of further vandalism at jewish community  jewish cemeteries rather the cowardly destruction in philadelphia this weekend comes on top of similar accounts from missouri and threats made to jewish community centers around the country the president continues to condemn these and any other form of antisemitic and hateful acts in the strongest terms from our countrys founding weve been dedicated to protecting the freedom of our citizens rights to worship no one in america should feel afraid to follow the religion of their choosing freely and openly the president is dedicated to preserving this originating principle of our nationand while were at it i dont want to get ahead of the law enforcement but i was asked the other day about the story in kansas  the shooting in kansas and while the story is evolving early reports out of kansas are equally disturbingso with that ill be glad to take your questions jonq  sean theres a report this morning that you reached out directly to cia director pompeo did you directly contact director pompeo and ask him to knock down the new york times story on the russia connectionmr spicer thanks jon let me kind of if i may walk through the entire timeline i think its importantas i mentioned i think a week ago the new york times published a story about what they called contacts between members of the trump campaign and russian officials the fbi deputy director was at a meeting here at the white house that morning after the meeting concluded he asked the chief of staff to stand back a second he wanted to tell him that the report in the new york times was bs for viewers at home i think you can pretty much figure what that means but ill leave it at thatat that time the chief of staff said thank you for sharing that with me can we let other people know that the story is not accurate throughout the day they went back and forth to see what they thought was appropriate finally came to the conclusion that they did not want to get in the process of knocking down every story that they had issues with they then  we then were informed that other people had come to the same conclusions including  at that time chairman devin nunes had told us hey ive been knocking this down telling reporters we shared a number with him of a reporter that had contacted us and again when the reporters contact us and we said no thats not  to the best of our knowledge thats not true they were asking us can you point to anybody else that can substantiate this and i think we did a good job of saying sure we will share with reporters other people who have come to the same conclusion so i wont go into the specifics i will say that i think we did our job very effectively by making sure that reporters who had had questions about the accuracy and the claims made in the new york times that we were pointing them to subjectmatter experts who understood whether or not that story was accurate or not and i think just to continue to be very very clear on this  it was about the accuracy of the reporting and the claims that were made in there plain and simple  about whether or not a story that appeared in the new york times was accurate and individual after individual continued to say that as far as they knew they werent i think most of you probably saw chairman nuness comments this morning he was very clear number one that he reached out to us to say ive been telling people reporters that these allegations and descriptions in the new york times are not accurate and then we shared that information with him but he came to us to share that he equally had that issue brought up to him he was briefed and saw no evidence that the story was accurateso the answer is we have continued to give reporters information and sources that went to the accuracy or lack thereof of a report that was in a newspaper and i think chairman nunes also equally said its interesting how we literally were engaging with the press saying if you have a question about the sourcing on this  obviously when brought to our attention we said its not accurate as we know but then most of you and your colleagues who had inquired would say well thats great im sure youre saying this but who else can corroborate this so our job was to continue to  when informed  share sources who had equally come to the same conclusion that the times story was not accurateq  you dont think theres something strange about  something odd about the white house press secretary getting the cia director on the phone to knock down a story about an investigationmr spicer no no but see respectfully youre using words like knock down there was a story in a newspaper q  was it disputedmr spicer hold on no no  there was reporters coming to us saying there is a story out there whats your take on it and our answer was we dont believe its accurate we dont do believe its false but obviously thats our take on it and reporters were saying to us well is there anybody that you can point to to substantiate this claim now remember this all started with the fbi coming to us bringing to our attention saying that the story in the times was not accurate  in fact it was bs  and all we did was simply say thats great could you tell other reporters the same thing youre telling us and i would think that other reporters yourself included would think that that would be a helpful thing to get the story straight all we sought to do was to actually get an accurate report out and again i think chairman nunes this morning over and over and over and over again made it very clear that no evidence that has been brought to his attention suggests that that reporting was accurateso respectfully i think its interesting that im being asked whats appropriate when what were doing is actually urging reporters to engage with subjectmatter experts who can corroborate whether or not something is accurate or notq  should there be a special prosecutor darrell issa has called for a special prosecutor to look into thismr spicer and i guess my question would be a special prosecutor for whatq  to look into the whole russia connection the whole russia influencing mr spicer and heres my  right and i guess my q  i mean he was part of the campaign so  i mean sessions was part of the campaign the attorney generalmr spicer i understand but heres my question jonathan we have now for six months heard story after story come out about unnamed sources say the same thing over and over again and nothing has come of it right weve heard the same people the same anecdotes and weve heard reports over and over again and as chairman nunes made very clear today he has seen nothing that corroborates that so at what point  you got to ask yourself what are you investigatingq  well russian interference  i mean beyond the contextmr spicer no and i think that both the house and the senate have looked at it you know as well as i do that the intelligence community has looked at it as well theres a big difference i think that russias involvement in activity has been investigated up and down so the question becomes at some point if theres nothing to further investigate what are you asking people to investigate i mean chairman nunes spoke very clearly today when asked over and over and over again about all of this and said that he has seen nothing that leads him to believe that theres there the president has spoken forcefully time and time again that he has no interests in russia he hasnt talked to people in russia in years and yet you keep asking  and when i say you collectively  to try to find something that seemingly at least the reporting that im seeing in different organizations suggests that theres nothing new thats being reported its the same stuff over and over again that weve heard for literally six months and so the question becomes at some point what do you need to further investigate if there is nothing that has come outq  can you not categorically deny there were no contacts between the russians and anybody on the campaignmr spicer i cant deny  i cant  i guess my question is q  thats what the investigation would look atmr spicer right and i guess my point is is that youve had the intelligence community look at russias involvement in the election you had the house and senate both do the same and so what im trying to ascertain is that at what point  how many people have to say that theres nothing there before you realize theres nothing there i cant say unequivocally  all im saying is the people who have done the investigating about russia overall and its activities in the united states specifically now with respect to our election havent provided anything that leads me to believe or should lead you to believe  and i continue to see reports coming from  there were media sources saying when they checked in with law enforcement or intelligence community sources theres nothing more than has been previously reported over and over againso at some point you do have to ask yourself what are you actually looking for how many times do you have to come to the same conclusion before you take the answer and thats where i  maraq  just to be clear did you  just to follow up on that did you personally reach out to pompeo mr spicer im not going to discuss what we did internally im just going to say that when we shared  we did our job about making sure that when people had  reporters had questions we let them know what subjectmatter experts were available to discuss the accuracy of the newspaper storymaraq  yeah im sure people will come back to this but i actually have a budget question which is during the campaign the president said he was not going to touch medicare or social security his treasury secretary repeated that it sounded like the omb director was leaving that as an open question tbd im just wondering whats the state of the promise that we wont touch it for current retirees mr spicer what the omb director made clear is how it works the budget is dealing with the topline discretionary numbers policy decisions are not part of the budget that was what he was being asked and what he  so i just want to be clear in terms of what it was and again i think q   the state of the promise in other words what is the promise mr spicer right and i think the state of the promise is clear and i think as you point out he had made the promise he stands by the promise the treasury secretary q  but what is the promise current retirees people near retirement anybody paying into mr spicer i will follow up specifically on that but i think the president has made very clear that its not his intent to do  he wants to focus on the discretionary side that entitlement reform is not  that with respect to those programs that he mentioned he stands by his wordfredq  i wanted to ask a couple issues an executive order on religious freedom had previously been in the works will that still come and if it does will it extend beyond religious freedommr spicer im sorry fred whatq  will it extend beyond the johnson amendmentmr spicer i think weve discussed executive orders in the past and for the most part were not going to get into discussing what may or may not come until were ready to announce it so im sure as we move forward well have somethingolivierq  thanks sean q  im sorry just one more the issue of types of reforms will there be  how committed is the administration to a border adjustment tax and is there any concern that there wont be enough conservative support for that that it could block any meaningful tax reform longtermmr spicer well im not going to get into the specifics of tax reform today the president has made clear that well have an outline of the plan very soon but what i will say is that i think he has talked about the concerns that he has with current regulatory and tax policy that benefit people from moving out of the country and shipping jobs  or products back in while shedding american workers he will continue to fight for policies that promote manufacturing and job creation in the united states and supports american workers so i dont want to get ahead of the exact nature of the policy he has been seeking a lot of input as i mentioned earlier hes going to talk today with speaker ryan and senator mcconnell i know that both the joint session the status of repeal and replace and im sure some discussion of tax reform will probably come up but theres a lot  were continuing to move forward and work with themolivierq  thanks a couple on the isis strategy can you just get to the timetable from now now that you received it  what happens and theres a report that youre asking for  billion in emergency defense spending on top of the  billion in the budget is that true does that cover the new isis strategy can you explain whats different between the twomr spicer thank you right now literally that principals meeting  or principals meeting that i mentioned at the beginning is happening as we speak so secretary mattis was coming over to brief the principals as far as the isis plan and again part of it was to make sure that he fully discusses the recommendations that hes making and seek the input and feedback of the other principals downstairs that can help guide where we go from here how we go with respect to the funding i think director mulvaney noted that there will be a supplemental at some point right now the focus is on the budget and then well go from therejohn gizziq  thank you sean two brief questions first i read your statement at the thursday briefing to governor malloy of connecticut during the nga meeting and he responded  and i quote  sean didnt read a thing that i said he said that he  in connecticut they are already working to get criminals who are in the country illegally out his objection was to going into warming centers or schools where officials might frighten children your response to the governor on thatmr spicer well again i was asked specifically what his stance  what the comments were with respect to sanctuary cities and again i would reiterate with all due respect to the governor im not here to pick a fight with the governor i enjoyed my time going to school in the state of connecticut i have a kind affection of the nutmeg state but the reality is i think that theres a difference whether or not what he wants to do is state funds maybe  without knowing the exact nature of how hes funding what hes funding its difficult the question i was asked at the time was on how we would be handling it and i think the answer whether its connecticut or california is that the presidents executive order and the presidents commitment is to make sure that tax dollars are not used to support programs that are helping people who are not in the country legally and who are not citizens entitled to themq  one more question seanmr spicer okay starting early laughter q  for  years when presidents have gone to rome theyve always met the pope going back to when president eisenhower met pope john xxiii now one year ago this week candidate trump had a disagreement with this pope and an exchange of words when he goes to rome in may for his first european trip will he meet with this popemr spicer thats a great question obviously i would be a huge fan of that but im not going to  i dont think were at that place in the planning process to make an announcement on any visits with the popeblakeq  sean thank you two budget questions if you dont mind mr mulvaney i believe just said that what the administration plans on putting forward doesnt add to the current deficit projection which the cbo says is about  billion but he didnt say that it would significantly draw from that either so my first question is is the administration comfortable putting something forward that might rack up deficits of potentially hundreds of billions of dollarsmr spicer well i think  im trying to understand the question a little if you can help me with this because he q  he said it wasnt going to add to itmr spicer rightq  so my question is he didnt necessarily say it was going to cut from it either if it doesnt cut from it potentially it could be hundreds of billions in deficit and im curious mr spicer right no but i think  correct me if im wrong  i mean he basically made it very clear it doesnt add to the projected baseline deficit so that continues to be the goal and i think as we continue to work through this process the passback you know it can work both ways we could identify further savings and reductions through working with the agencies and departments but were going to make sure that the topline number we maintain is as close to that as possibleand as we go through this  i mean this is the beginning of the process as the director noted we send the number to the department or the agency give them some ideas how we came up with this and then they come back to us and either justify why a particular program or office or what have you needs to stay in existence or why maybe not the reduction that is offered but its a backandforth process that will occur over the next few weeks so to get ahead of it is the problemq  let me ask you what nancy pelosi  to just get a quick reaction to nancy pelosi she put out a statement and said the following five weeks into his administration president trump has not introduced a single jobs bill your reaction to that would be whatmr spicer hes created a lot of jobs i think thats  hes continuing to work with congress on both repealing and replacing obamacare tax reform and fundamentally both of those two items alone i think can help spur a lot of economic growth the meetings that weve had with the ceos the health insurers  there are so many things that are both jobkilling and that can be done to help promote a better regulatory and tax climate that lead to job creationi think thats one of the biggest problems right now is that people in washington arent necessarily talking to job creators and saying what is the impediment that you have to hiring more american workers what are the impediments that you have to manufacturing more to building herethe meetings and the actions that the president has taken on both regulatory and other matters have helped spur job creation youve heard these companies come in over and over again  the automakers airlines sprint  i mean the list goes on and on and on of people saying to the president because of your agenda because of your vision were willing to commit to hiring additional people to manufacturing more thats how jobs are created  its not through the government and too often its the government regulations that stifle and prevent job creation and i think the president as a businessman fully appreciates and understands how this works and what some of those impediments do to creating jobs and to growing the economyand so i would just say that you havent seen anything yet its going to continue to be the casetreyq  thanks sean is there concern in the administration that a largescale military buildup will appear threatening to other countries around the world and lead to some sort of arms race with other countriesmr spicer no i think when you look at the state of some of the infrastructure in our military whether its the age of our ships or our planes or some of the other hardware that exists you recognize that we need to rebuild a lot of these things the size of our navy has gone down significantly and there are new needs and new  and when you look at the commitment that you have to make not just in one year but in several years for a lot of these programs  ships and tanks even weapons systems  they dont get built in a month or a day you have to make a commitment early on to make the investment because of the time that it takes to procure them to build them the research and development that goes into itand so i would just suggest to you that this is the first step in making sure we make the commitment to a military that through especially through the sequester the last few years has not gotten the funding it needs to get off life support there are a lot of things that are being taken care of for the military where theyre just continuing to  theyre not putting the systems and the projects in place to allow the military to keep up with the times and thats a problemmajorq  sean one investigation question and one budget question as you may be aware bill owens the father of william ryan owens gave an interview with the miami herald over the weekend and he said the government owes my son an investigation on behalf of the president of the united states is the president open to an investigation to the raid in yemen and the father of ryan owens called that a stupid mission is there something that youd like to communicate to him about that mission that might persuade him otherwisemr spicer yeah thank you thats multipart so let me kind of walk through it slowlyfirst of all i cant possibly imagine what hes going through in terms of the loss of his son i can tell him that on behalf of the president his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid as ive said before is going to safe american lives its going to protect our country moreso he made a sacrifice to this country he was on his th deployment and i know that his wife when she spoke to the president knows that he did this because he loved it he cared about our nation and the mission was successful in helping prevent a future attack or attacks on this nation it obtained a lot of information that will help us keep safewith respect to his request it is standard operating procedure for the department of defense to undergo what they call a  review that review in this case is threepronged because there was a fatality and a loss of life theres that because there were civilians involved thats another and then third is because there was hardware  a helicopter that was damaged that is a separate so in fact there will be three reviews done by the department of defense because of the nature of this but again i cant stress enough that on behalf of the president on behalf of this nation we express our condolences extend our prayers to him during this timeq  as you said that is standard procedure is there anything the president is particularly curious about with this mission in that it was brought to him he authorized it quickly does he believe in the main it was carried out well and theres nothing that hes particularly curious about in the way either the helicopter was damaged fatality the civilian casualties  anything of the likemr spicer well number one ive walked through the timetable previously in terms of how long this had been planned for dating well back into the previous administration and as you know their recommendation at the time was to wait for a moonless night that night wasnt going to occur during president obamas administration and so when general mattis got into the department of defense he was briefed up on the status of the thing made aware of when the next time was go we went through the process to ensure that we continued to believe that the mission  the way it was going to be conducted and the results of the mission would be worthy of action the conclusion continued to be as it was prior that we should move forward as i mentioned before i think you cant ever say that when theres most importantly loss of life and people injured that its  percent successful but i think when you look at what the stated goal of that mission was  it was an information and intelligencegathering mission and it achieved its objectivesso again i would express our thoughts and our prayers and our condolences to all of the people in chief owenss family and his friends his shipmates but its something that as a seal and as somebody who deployed  times he knew that this was part of the job and he knew what he was doing and so were very comfortable with how the mission was executed and well let the department of defense go through that review process and then see where that leads usbut i think to get ahead of the three separate reviews that are being done by the department of defense would be probably a little irresponsible at this timeq  sean mr spicer major gets two too q  just real quick on the budget as youre aware to undo the defense sequester you have to get  votes in the senate because you have a separate domestic sequester number and defense are you confident with these numbers and with this kind of heavy discretionary spending cut proposed you can get the  votes to change the law because without that change in law the proposal is just that  it doesnt become operationalmr spicer i think that when it comes to our nations security specifically our nations military i dont think that its a partisan issue i think that senators from across the country  whether youre talking about florida or whether youve got an army installation or a navy base you understand the state of repair that many of our planes ships and other hardware is in and i think that there is a bipartisan commitment to give the military and its members the equipment and the tools it needs to succeed and protect this country so i do feel confidentaprilq  sean i have a couple of budgetary questions for you one at the press conference president trump talked about the fix for inner cities what is the investment in this budget when it comes to a fix for inner citiesmr spicer its a good try i think the director was very clear q  thats one mr spicer i mean part of the process today was to start that passback process that he talked about where were going to the various departments whether its hud or dot and giving them that topline number and then hearing back so i dont want to get into a specific number with you before we get too far down the process i think thats a conversation that were going to have with the agencies and then we will have subsequently with congress when they start drafting their resolutionsq  okay a followup on this but i do have a question on hbcus see he talked about healthcare he talked about education and he talked about crime he needs to talk about chicago and law enforcement so you dont have any kind of budgetary numbers when it comes to it and healthcare is a piece that is one of the line items for this budgetmr spicer thats right and im not saying that we dont have numbers im saying that were not giving them out thats a big differenceq  inaudiblemr spicer i know laughter youre going to do a good job trying laughterbut as the director noted on this that they have come up with topline numbers based on their going through each of these agencies budget and saying hey theres a duplicative program here in some cases maybe they give them more maybe they give them less part of it is to begin that conversation that process with the departments and agencies to figure out what those investments are maybe its repurposing existing funds in a different way so its not necessarily a zerosum game there is a way that a department can reallocate money to a program that might end up benefitting because there is a duplicative or outofdate program or office that that savings could be applied to something but i dont want to get ahead of the process right now only to say that we are at the very beginning of itq  and one on hbcusmr spicer yesq  the president is going to see the plus presence of hbcus with the vice president today some of them are very concerned as to what this executive order looks like and they are waiting to hear the commitment before they say im all in what is the commitment that this president is trying to make when it comes to hbcus to ensure i guess their future or deal with funding for research projects what have you or moving it out of the department of education to the purview of the white house what is the commitment that hes going to give to themmr spicer so look i dont generally speak about executive orders until theyre finalized i will just say that one of the things that i think theres commitment from this white house to do is to look at the various resources throughout the federal government that support hbcusso for example the department of defense has rotc and nrotc programs are they being properly  is that funding being properly executed and spent theres programs within each of the departments  the department of education the department of housing and urban development  that affect grants or programs or direct funding that go to hbcus for various different things whether its construction projects or teaching programs or mentorship programs whatever it is they span throughout the entire government and i think that what we are committed to doing is ensuring that there is a high level of understanding and commitment that goes straight to the president of how we harness those resource within the government and make sure that theyre doing what theyre supposed to be doingso its one thing to have them right spread throughout the different departments its another thing to make sure that theres a direct pipeline to the president of the united states that those programs are being executed in a way thats benefitting the future of hbcus and the various projects and teaching that goes on thereq  and so what are you saying  theres going to be a piece that is going to basically go throughout all the agencies to make sure that there is some kind of commitment to hbcus and contract of like lets say engineering for some schools or in research for other schoolsmr spicer yeah i would say  i think im going to stick to waiting until we announce it to get out a lot more q  is that today or tomorrowmr spicer i anticipate it very soon how is that i want to give myself a little wiggle roomphil ruckerq  yeah sean thanks a budgetrelated question but on infrastructure the president has repeatedly including today again called for a major infrastructure plan to the tune a trillion dollars  roads bridges tunnels you name it can you explain where that money is going to come from how it fits into the budget thats under review right now and what the timeline for that project would bemr spicer so i think that would be part of a longerterm discussion that were having with congress as you know the president got in office someodd days ago the idea of getting a budget is  you know its commonly referred to as a skinny budget  is to get the government to continue to be funding and it will be something that well work with congressi understand your point the president continues to talk about the status q   a priority for himmr spicer it is absolutely but i think that weve got to make sure that its done right and that we work with congress i think as you correctly mention theres obviously a funding mechanism to this and weve already talked about things like comprehensive tax reform that could add to that discussion and so i just  i understand what youre asking in terms of how this would be funded and when it will be coming and the payfors but were working with congress to have that discussion i think that comes probably outside of the budget discussionq  and so how does he square that with the need to tighten the belt which he also talked about today  weve been spending too much as a government and we need to cut our spendingmr spicer right but i think  but in the same manner that were presenting the budget so were talking about adding  million   trillion rather  a billion dollars to  thank you appreciate the help here laughterbut were looking to add that to defense and so what it means is that we have to look through other programs to find reductions in savings i think that same kind of discussion would happen with respect to infrastructure not necessarily the savings piece but the funding piece that theres several ways  and i know that theres a lot of discussion privatepublic partnerships that he is started to have a discussion with in terms of the funding mechanismand so all im trying to get at is that there are various ways to do this funding without just relying on the american taxpayer in terms of additional taxes there are spending reductions there are other funding mechanisms and i think in due course we will get around to that discussionq  and just related to that he mentioned in his remarks about infrastructure today that as he drives through the queensmidtown tunnel and the lincoln tunnel he worries about ceiling tiles falling is there a specific incident he was talking about where people have been injured or is that just a fear of hismr spicer i dont know ill ask laughter but im sure secret service will take care of the  alleviating the medium concernshold on alexisq  sean i have two questions first one on healthcare because the omb director was signaling that the complete budget would be made ready early may and the president today described how complicated he had discovered that the healthcare repeal and replace has become can you describe when it is that the president would present his framework for an overhaul of healthcare is it going to be included in the budget so we would see it before maymr spicer i dont think youre going to see it in the budget no thats not the appropriate vehicle for it i think ive mentioned it before i think you would drive  or at least the leading option before i get locked into something is to add obamacare to the fy budget process and put it through reconciliation so that would happen outside of the current budget structurebut i think he has also been very clear that he wants this outline within a matter of weeks and that we continue to have these discussions with house and senate leadership with ways and means and energy and commerce and then similar on senate finance on the senate side so when he talks to speaker ryan and leader mcconnell today im sure that conversation will continue q  just to follow up on healthcare because not every ingredient in the affordable care act can be handled in reconciliation thats why i was asking about the elements of it that we see in the budgetmr spicer thats rightq  so we will see some of thosemr spicer well theres several pieces of obamacare some can be done by executive order some get done with  votes some have to be done specifically in reconciliation i think counter to majors point on a previous question that there are certain things that have to be done in certain ways legislatively and to create a comprehensive and holistic approach to both repealing it and replacing it and were aware of that were working with the house and the senate to make that happenq  and my second topicmr spicer of courseq  all right the immigration executive order the travel ban  is the president going to address the american people and congress in his speech tomorrow night and specifically describe and defend the immigration ban and when will we see the revised executive ordermr spicer so were not going to  i would not anticipate the speech being a defense of legislation and executive orders i dont think many previous presidents have gotten through and used that as a legislative walkthrough but you will hear about his commitment to immigration and his desire for border security and what it means not just about keeping the nation safe but what impact its having on the economy so you will hear a lot about immigration tomorrow night and he will talk about why it matters and the goal that we have and why we should come together on areas like thisq  can i follow up on that seanmr spicer hold on katelynq  wheres the next ordermr spicer oh im sorry the next order i think we should have it out probably middle of this week looking towards the middle of the week and well have further updates as we get through the schedule i think obviously our priority right now today was the really get the budget process kicked off and then continue to prepare for the joint sessionkatelynq  thank youq  sean can i follow on thatmr spicer you will in a secondq  an internal report in  identified  billion in wasteful pentagon spending so how can you justify adding  billion to the defense budget is that going to go to hiring soldiers or bureaucrats or contractors and is the president concerned with wasteful spending at the dodmr spicer of course hes concerned hes concerned with wasteful spending throughout the government but i think theres also a big difference between rooting out waste and fraud in various programs and offices and understanding that when youre talking about adding to the fleet or increasing airplane costs that that cant be driven just through those and the commitment that you have to make to purchase some of those veryneeded upgrades to our infrastructure and to our arsenal and to planes and ships doesnt just come through that because even if you could start to really identify you really wouldnt be able to make the financial commitment that needs to be done to rebuild some of the ships and planes in particular that need a substantial investment on the front endjohnq  if i could just follow on alexiss question the th circuit court of appeals has just denied your request to suspend proceedings in regard to the initial executive order that order came out just within the last few minutes so do you plan to continue defending your first executive order in court and whats the purpose of doing that as opposed to simply rescinding it and then rendering that case mootmr spicer well i havent been able to read my phone while this has happened so i q  thats why i read mr spicer laughter thank you i appreciate it so with all due respect i would ask that i be able to get back to you tomorrow on that after we consult with the counsels office and go through the briefing and the  excuse me the reading of what the court has said but give me a little time let me get off the podium q  i mean the rescinding it question still stands regardless of the mr spicer i understand that and i think that the president has made a commitment right now to continue to defend what we didq  for what reasonmr spicer hold on because this is the strategy that  he believes that we have the authority vested in us code ive talked about this extensively in the past and i think that if youll allow me once we get done with the briefing i will follow up with the counsels officeq  but the point that some of us are trying to understand is if you have a new executive order that you believe addresses the concerns of the many courts who have weighed in on this why continue to defend an executive order that  mr spicer because hes  i mean because we were right the first time and i think that q  are you trying to prove a pointmr spicer hold on  no but i think that its not a question of proving a point its that the manner in which it was done in the first place was what we believe and continue to believe was the right way to address this problemand while the second executive order attempts to address the courts concerns that they made the goal is obviously to maintain the way that we did it the first time because we believe that the law is very clear about giving the president the authority that he needs to protect the countryso just dropping that is not necessarily the most prudent thing and i think part of it is for us to recoup right now figure out what the court has said and then reassess the strategy but i dont want to get ahead as you point out youre reading it to me now  i would like the opportunity to maybe go read it and actually have a lawyer read it  since that wont do very muchgo aheadq  sean thank you on antisemitism that was a good strong statement is there anything that the federal government can do to protect jewish institutions are there any leads who is doing this and also on sequester when can sequester be liftedmr spicer when can it be liftedq  yesmr spicer i think weve got to go through the process to lift the sequester and so well deal with thatwith respect to some of the activity that weve seen at jewish cemeteries in particular  look i think we have to work with law enforcement at a local and state level ill leave it to the department of justice to comment further on what additional steps can be made but i think  as has been pointed out multiple times i think one of the things that we can do is speak from this podium in particular and other places to make sure that every american understands what our values are and that that kind of behavior and activity is wrong and wont be tolerated and the highest levels of government denounce itso i think it starts at that and then i think theres a law enforcement component that i would ask you to touch base withq  sean two on the budget mr spicer yesq  i understand this is a blueprint i understand the president has previously said he doesnt want to touch entitlements but why does he think its the right move to break with years of republican orthodoxy house speaker paul ryan who have said that any sensible longterm budget needs to include entitlement reformmr spicer look im just going to  i think the president understands the commitment that was made to seniors in particular and that its a sacred bond and a trustand i think  look mara asked this earlier  i think let me get back to you on the specifics but i think he made a commitment to the american people and one of the things that i think the president continues to get high marks on is that regardless of whether you voted for him or not or you agree with his policies hes a man of his word and he has followed up on the promises that he made to the american people and i think thats importantnow again i think that we will continue to work with congress but the president understands that we have commitments that weve made on the entitlement side in particular and especially on the senior side with respect to social security that need to be maintained and so hes going to keep this word to the american people q  but if you talk to some economic analysts they say social security medicare wont be there in a number of years if we dont address the fundamental problemsmr spicer and i think that  right and so for right now i think the budget that were laying out deals on the discretionary side youve heard the presidents priorities and commitment especially when it comes to protecting this country and if we have anything further ill let you knowq  and one more  sean one more is there an internal leak inquiry right nowmr spicer not that im aware ofq  thank you very much sean i have two questions on uschina relationship if i maymr spicer you mayq  thank youmr spicer everyone else gets twoq  first of all since president trump took office china sends it very first senior official state counselor yang jiechi to visit washington dc today will there will be a meeting with in the white house and whats the white houses expectation of his visitmr spicer so the state counselor and for those of you not schooled in the chinese government is basically the equivalent of our nsa director  nsc director correct q  yesmr spicer so the ambassador and the state counselor came today they had a meeting with hr mcmaster jared kushner and i think some others sat in on the meeting they had a delegation of six people here after the meeting ended i believe the state counselor was taken and had an opportunity to say hi to the president before he left this is an opportunity to begin that conversation and talk to them on shared interests of national securityq  sean mr spicer sorry hold on he gets one more everybody else did q  can i have a follow upmr spicer hold on hold on hold on let me just  everybody else got twoq  yes just this morning president trump mentioned about his pick for ambassador to china governor mr spicer branstadq  branstad governor branstad apparently has a really positive view on china mr spicer yeahq  so how confident the president is on the governors confirmation to get all the support in the senatemr spicer oh i think hell receive tremendous support  bipartisan support governor branstad has been  is a true  he has huge ties on both sides i think hes one of the longest serving governors ever definitely in iowa and i think that he has tremendous respect from both sides of the aisle not just for how hes handled himself as a governor in iowa but his deep understanding and ties to china and to chinas economy and to chinese officials and i think hes going to do a phenomenal job representing our nationhe starts with a deep understanding of the chinese economy the chinese government and that is going to really serve our nation wellmaraq  can i just have a followup on china thank you because i know i got one beforemr spicer you did q  i appreciate that a lot of people voted for donald trump because they felt  they agreed with him that the us was getting ripped off by china and after the election he made the call to taiwan which he was praised for then he told fox news  he said i dont know why we have to be bound by a onechina policy unless we make a deal with china having to do with other things including trade then he reaffirmed the onechina policy so what did he get in return from china for doing thatmr spicer well he had a conversation with president xi im not going to get into the details of it but at the presidents  president xis request and after a discussion the president reaffirmed the onechina policy the president is not one to discuss his negotiating tactics so i q  but did he get something can he assure the american people he got somethingmr spicer the president always gets something ryanq  well what was it what was it q  sean two quick followups first of all i noticed earlier today there were a lot of republican governors out here but not very many democratic governors is this administration actively attempting to reach out to the other side of the aisle for compromisemr spicer yeah i think if you saw the remarks during this pool opportunity the president talked about some of the conversations he had with governor mcauliffe in virginia in particular but they were here last night they had dinner with their wives and husbands it was an opportunity to really talk to the cabinet and get to know each other and talk about prioritiesi will say that  its interesting i mentioned obamacare when one of the things that was brought up by the governors  and ive got to be honest i wasnt picking which governors and thinking of party  but it came up over and over again that they actually  several of them commented on how appreciative they have been in terms of seeking their input on not just healthcare but infrastructure and medicaid in particular and other areas that fall into their thing  to their wheelhouseso i think  just so were clear the dialogue that exists between this administration and this president and governors i think is a very refreshing move forwardq  and then my point  a followup a quick followup i want to clarify a little bit of something that happened thursday and friday about the public enemy statement are you saying that all of the press is the public enemy people who didnt vote for the president just the people in this room or  is it just bill maher and maybe warren beatty can you clarify what were talking aboutmr spicer i think the president made clear in his tweet that he was referring to the fake news and people who ascribe to pushing fake stories is where his target wasq  thanks a lot sean as you know more than  democrats either boycotted or skipped the presidents inauguration what kind of reception do you think the president will get tomorrow evening from democrats in the house and senate when he gives his joint addressmr spicer well i hope a very robust and applausefilled reception the speech as i mentioned breaks down a lot of barriers that have traditionally been political barriers in terms of areas where i think we should find agreement that reaffirm the presidents desire to unite the country and unite our parties in areas of shared common groundand i think the things that hes talking about  increasing the support to our military our veterans helping children get an education  those are things that hopefully we can all come together and think are shared american values regardless of party i hope that we see a tremendous amount of support for the president and his policies and his vision tomorrow night he recognizes the problems that our nation faces but he also charts a vision forward and i think its one that if people are honest that they will agree that it really isnt a political agenda as much as an agenda for this country and one to move us forwardso i think that well have to wait and see but i can tell you that i think it will be a positive move forwardzekeq  thanks sean couple followups to oliviers question earlier about the isis review its day  the memorandum the president signed  days ago said that he was supposed to be briefed can you give us a more  a timeline on when specifically president trump will be involved  i know you mentioned theres a principals meeting earlier today  what the timeline of the review is and then separately

county has said that its costing  a day in overtime pay every time the president comes to visit west palm beach hes slated to go there again this weekend according to some reports is the president taking any steps to ensure that taxpayers arent saddled with tremendous costs in his travel habits considering he was so critical of his predecessor on that mattermr spicer well gabi the security for the president and the first family is set by the secret service as you know they determine the security measures that need to be taken to protect the president  frankly any president so im going to leave it up to the secret service to decide what security measures and steps are taken to protect the presidentand as you know i mean this  depending on  it transcends administrations wherever the president goes they need to make sure that the president and the first family is safe thats something that i think  we rely on the secret service to make those determinations they continue to do a phenomenal job making sure that the first family and the president and the vice president are protected and we have full confidence in the decisions that they makeso thank you guys very much well have

worstaudience usa usa usa applausethe president so  sit down laughter donald trump did not get a standing ovation they leave out the part they never sat down they leave that out so i just want to thank  but you know my first major speech was at cpac and probably five or six years ago  first major political speech and you were thereand it was  i loved it i love the people i love the commotion and then they did these polls where i went through the roof and i wasnt even running right but it gave me an idea and i got a little bit concerned when i saw what was happening in the country and i said lets go do it so it was very exciting i walked the stage on cpac ill never forget it really i had very little notes and even less preparation so when you have practically no notes and no preparation and then you leave and everybody was thrilled i said i think i like this businessi would have come last year but i was worried that i would be at that time too controversial we wanted border security we wanted very very strong military we wanted all of the things that were going to get and people consider that controversial but you didnt consider it controversial applauseso ive been with cpac for a long time all of these years weve been together and now you finally have a president finally took you a long time took you a long time applauseand its patriots like you that made it happen believe me  believe me you did it because you love your country because you want a better future for your children and because you want to make america great again applausethe media didnt think we would win audience member they knew laughterthe president the pundits  youre right they had an idea the pundits didnt think we would win the consultants that suck up all that money oh they suck it up theyre so good laughter theyre not good at politics but theyre really good at sucking up peoples money especially my opponents because i kept them down to a minimumthe president but the consultants didnt think we would win but they all underestimated the power of the people  you and the people proved them totally wrong never  and this is so true and this is whats been happening  never underestimate the people never i dont think it will ever happen againand i want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news its fake  phony fake applause a few days ago i called the fake news the enemy of the people  and they are they are the enemy of the people because they have no sources they just make them up when there are none i saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed there are no nine people i dont believe there was one or two people nine people and i said give me a break because i know the people i know who they talked to there were no nine people but they say nine people and somebody reads it and they think oh nine people they have nine sources they make up sourcesthey are very dishonest people in fact in covering my comments the dishonest media did not explain that i called the fake news the enemy of the people  the fake news they dropped off the word fake and all of the sudden the story became the media is the enemy they take the word fake out and now im saying oh no this is no good but thats the way they are so im not against the media im not against the press i dont mind bad stories if i deserve them and i tell you i love good stories but we wont  laughter  i dont get too many of thembut i am only against the fake news media or press  fake fake they have to leave that word im against the people that make up stories and make up sources they shouldnt be allowed to use sources unless they use somebodys name let their name be put out there let their name be put out applause a source says that donald trump is a horrible horrible human being let them say it to my face applause let there be no more sources and remember this  and in not all in all cases i mean i had a story written yesterday about me in reuters by a very honorable man it was a very fair story there are some great reporters around theyre talented theyre honest as the day is long theyre great but there are some terrible dishonest people and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people a tremendous disservice they are very dishonest people and they shouldnt use sources they should put the name of the person you will see stories dry up like youve never seen beforeso you have no idea how bad it is because if you are not part of the story  and i put myself in your position sometimes because many of you youre not part of the story and if youre not part of the story then you sort of know if you are part of the story you know what theyre saying is true or not so when they make it up and they make up something else and you saw that before the election  polls polls the polls they come out with these polls and everybody was so surprised actually a couple of polls got it right i must say los angeles times did a great job shocking because  you know they did a great job applause and we had a couple of others that were rightbut generally speaking i mean i can tell you the network somebody said a poll came out and i say what network is it and theyll say a certain  lets not even mention names right should wewell you have a lot of them look the clinton new network is one applause totally take a look honestly take a look at their polls over the last two years now you would think they would fire the pollster right after years and years of getting battered but i dont  i mean who knows maybe theyre just bad at polling or maybe theyre not legit but its one or the other look at how inaccurate  look at cbs look at abc also look at nbc take a look at some of these polls theyre so bad so inaccurate and what that does is it creates a false narrative it creates like this narrative thats just like were not going to win and people say oh i love trump but you know im not feeling great today he cant win so i wont go and vote i wont go and vote it creates a whole false deal and we have to fight it folks we have to fight it theyre very smart theyre very cunning and theyre very dishonestso just to conclude  i mean its a very sensitive topic and they get upset when we expose their false stories they say that we cant criticize their dishonest coverage because of the first amendment you know they always bring up the first amendment laughter and i love the first amendment nobody loves it better than me nobody applause i mean who uses it more than i dobut the first amendment gives all of us  it gives it to me it gives it to you it gives all americans  the right to speak our minds freely it gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news and criticize it strongly applause and many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda and its not your agenda and its not the countrys agenda its their own agenda they have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly but as you saw throughout the entire campaign and even now the fake news doesnt tell the truth doesnt tell the truthso just in finishing i say it doesnt represent the people it never will represent the people and were going to do something about it because we have to go out and we have to speak our minds and we have to be honest our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before applause and im here fighting for you and i will continue to fight for you the victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in

blocks there is such love in this country for everything we stand for you saw that on election day applause and youre going to see it more and more applause so were all part of this very historic movement a movement the likes of which actually the world has never seen before theres never been anything like this theres been some movements but theres never been anything like this theres been some movements that petered out like bernie  petered out laughter but it was a little rigged against him  superdelegate superdelegate she had so many delegates before the thing even started i actually said to my people how does that happen laughter not that im a fan of bernie but a lot of bernie people voted for trump you know why because hes right on one issue trade he was right about tradeour country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals so he was right about that but weve got a lot of bernie support so actually i like bernie okay i like bernie applause but im here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the republican party and for the future of america first we need to define what this great great unprecedented movement is and what it actually represents the core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first applause for too long weve traded away our jobs to other countries  so terrible weve defended other nations borders while leaving ours wide open anybody can come in audience member a wallthe president oh were going to build the wall dont worry about it were building the wall were building the wall in fact its going to start soon way ahead of schedule way ahead of schedule applause way way way ahead of schedule its going to start very soon general kelly by the way has done a fantastic job fantastic job hes done applause and remember we are getting the bad ones out these are bad dudes were getting the bad ones out okay were getting the bad  if you watch these people its like oh gee thats so sad were getting bad people out of this country people that shouldnt be  whether its drugs or murder or other things were getting bad ones out those are the ones that go first and i said it from day one basically all ive done is keep my promise applause weve spent trillions of dollars overseas while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay in the middle east weve spent as of four weeks ago  trillion think of it and by the way the middle east is in what  i mean its not even close  its in much worse shape than it was  years ago if our presidents would have gone to the beach for  years we would be in much better shape than we are right now that i can tell you applause yeah a hell of a lot better we could have rebuilt our country three times with that money this is the situation that i inherited i inherited a mess believe me we also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophenow ive been watching  and nobody says it  but obamacare doesnt work folks i mean i could say  i could talk  it doesnt work and now people are starting to develop a little warm heart but the people that youre watching theyre not you theyre largely  many of them are the side that lost you know they lost the election its like how many elections do we have to have they lost the election laughter but i

safe in this administration the epa will no longer spend unnecessary taxpayer dollars on an outofcontrol antienergy agenda the president is glad to finally have him officially onboard as you know we just came from boeing where the president talked jobs with company executives and celebrated the rollout of the amazing  dreamliner that airplane is an incredible example of what american ingenuity and initiative can create president trump is committed to unleashing us businesses so that we can create imagine inventive  and building in this country againunder the presidents ambitious jobs plan american industry will come roaring back hes already started ending jobkilling regulations and will be working to lower taxes on american businesses and the results are already on their way from intels incredible announcement last week to automakers keeping and bringing back thousands of jobs businesses across the country are responding to the presidents progrowth plansthe trip to boeing is the perfect cap on a week of tremendous progress on the presidents economic agenda and just yesterday he signed house joint resolution  nullifying the jobkilling streamprotection rule which went into effect on the very last day of the obama administration this rule was just the left again imposing an antiamerican energy agenda on the people without considering the significant cost it took power away from state and local governments in order to grow the federal bureaucracy ignoring the extremely negative impact it would have on hardworking americans and their families and the support by putting upward pressure on energy costs president trump is committed to ending the previous administrations war on coal which is really a war on our coal miners an october  economic analysis by the national mining association found that this rule jeopardizes as many as  jobs rolling back this rule is a significant step towards fulfilling the presidents promise to restore americas coalmining industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports the president is bringing back jobs at both the plant and mine level and the spirit of optimism rising across this country is only going to grow as the president signs more and more bills just like this one just look at the stock market which hit record numbers this week due to a surge in optimism in the business world and spurred by anticipation of the presidents impending progrowth agenda these sentiments were echoed during the presidents meeting on wednesday with a group of ceos from some of americas largest retailers the retail sector supports roughly  million jobs according to the national retail federal more than any other sector of the economy its also saddled with some of the most burdensome tax and regulations of any industry president trumps progrowth tax and regulatory reform plans will simplify our tax code and lower rates for hardworking americans and their companiesretail leaders thank the president for hosting them at the white house and noted that they were optimistic about the future because no previous president had ever been so willing to hear from them directly on the issues that impact their business and customers the president pledged to take appropriate action in the executive branch to address their concerns and to work closely with congressional leaders to pass legislation that will help create a dynamic booming economy that works for all americanstomorrow the president will be back in front of the people at a rally at the orlando melbourne international airportq  where is it  the international airportms sanders president trump just as he did so effectively throughout the campaign is going to continue taking his message directly to the american people i know hes looking forward to being back in florida a state that holds a special place in his heart where the winter white house is as well as a place that was so instrumental in his historic electoral victory in november and with that ill take a few of your questionsq  sarah can you talk about the expectations this weekend in terms of who hes going to meet with to fulfill the role of the national security advisorms sanders we dont have any announcements at this time but i know that obviously thats something the president takes very seriously and wants to make sure hes got the right person in the jobq  who is he consideringms sanders again we dont have any announcements or specific details to release at this timeq  can you give us a sense of his timetable we know he had hoped to try to fill this position by today thats obvious its not going to happen but do  is the expectation within the next two daysms sanders i dont know if we have a specific timetable but if we do ill get back to you on itq  are you thinking about redefining the job or changing the job description to make it more appealing or to make sure that people that its offered to will take itms sanders not to my knowledge but again i can check on thatq  while the president was at boeing did he express his commitment to funding the exim bankms sanders i dont know if that was specifically addressed are you talking about in the private meetingq  yeahms sanders yeah im not sure if that was specifically addressed i wasnt in the room for the private meetingq  generally does he support funding the exim bankms sanders you know i think thats a question that ill let him answer down the lineq  sarah the president yesterday said that he was going to be reintroducing the executive order  a different version of the executive order on immigration and refugees what is the white house doing differently this time around to ensure that the new order could withstand any legal challengems sanders the president was pretty specific yesterday when he talked about it in terms of that it would match and address the concerns that were part of the legal complications it ran into previouslyq  are different people involved is there a different signoff process  anything like thatms sanders no i mean again all of the people that needed to know the last time that would be part of this process would be involved in this process againq  has the president seen a complete order at this pointms sanders  i dont know if an order is finalized but i know theyre working on it and expect to have that at the first part of next weekq  has he looked at it in progress or will he wait until its finalized in its proposed form to take a look at itms sanders i know the president has been involved in the process but i dont know if he has seen the most uptodate versionq  sarah can you say if the administration has ever considered having the national guard help round up undocumented immigrantsms sanders the president and the white house have never had that as part of any plan to use the national guard in any capacity for thatq  why did kelly draft this memoms sanders im sorryq  why did kelly draft this memo if that was never consideredms sanders secretary kelly q  yeahms sanders secretary kelly did not draft that memoq  were now on day  q  who drafted it then wait who drafted itms sanders im not aware of the specific person but i know that it wasnt secretary kelly or at his directionq  were now  you know the president was inaugurated four weeks ago today why does he feel the need tomorrow to go back onto the stump and what should we expect to hear from him tomorrowms sanders i think its real simple the reason he wants to go back i think in large part its because his message when filtered through  unfortunately people standing in this circle dont always do the best job delivering his message and nobody does it better than he does and so he can do that very easily by taking the stage and talking directly to the people of america addressing their concerns and being able to properly express exactly what hes doing what his administration has done over the last month and what they plan to do in the coming weeksq  is this a campaign rally for  or is it a campaign rally for another candidate or how do you portray itms sanders i think its most likely a campaign rally for america i think its  again its the presidents time to be able to speak directly to people across this country in an unfiltered way and in a way that doesnt have any bias thats been expressed through the reporting that usually happensq  but its being funded by a political organization not the white house is that rightms sanders correctq  can you explain the fundingq  who is paying for the plane tomorrow going to and from the rally how thats being donems sanders specifically on the plane ill have to doublecheck i know the rally itself and i guess staging and everything to do with the rally is covered by the campaign but im not sure about the plane specifically so id have to q  so just to clarify when you say the campaign this is the campaign for whatms sanders well president trump still has a campaign in existence that can help pay for things that arent specific to the white house q   the donald j trump for president correct ms sanders yes thats still fully operationalq  so thats a  committee not a  committee because that committee is now defunctms sanders im not sure if its officially been transferred over from a  to a  focus but we can check on that and let you knowq  with increasing enforcement that weve see in this administration if you are not looking into having  national guard im curious if you think you have to change the immigration infrastructure at all add more judges or  youve already said you want to add more agents but with increased enforcement are you happy with what you have nationally and infrastructurewisems sanders thats probably a question that those departments  ice might be better able to answer whether or not they need additional support but right now were just glad that they have the opportunity to actually go out and do their job something they havent probably been allowed to do over the past eight yearsq  the president saying that he loves the daca kids and a couple have already been swept up in this increased enforcement will there be anything in terms of  besides that the president has talked about keeping daca going or not thats still up for debate  will you do anything for the daca kids who are not swept up in increased enforcementms sanders look i think the president addressed that yesterday he wants to make sure that thats done correctly obviously theres a compassion piece in that and hes looking at those options and seeing what the best path is on thatq  sarah just to be clear you dont know who authored the executive orderms sanders i dont specifically know who put pen to paper but i know that it was not secretary kelly and it wasnt at his directionq  did it happen during the transitionms sanders im not aware on the exact timeline of when it happened but what i do know is that this white house and this president is not and has had no plans in any capacity to use the national guard to round up peoplethanks guysend pm est

2017-02-16,Remarks by President Trump in Press Conference  ,east room pm estthe president thank you very much i just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the department of labor will be mr alex acosta he has a law degree from harvard law school was a great student former clerk for justice samuel alito and he has had a tremendous career hes a member and has been a member of the national labor relations board and has been through senate confirmation three times confirmed  did very very well and so alex ive wished him the best we just spoke and hes going to be  i think hell be a tremendous secretary of laborand also as you probably heard just a little while ago mick mulvaney former congressman has just been approved  weeks late i have to say that weeks weeks late office of management and budget and he will be i think a fantastic addition paul singer has just left as you know paul was very much involved with the antitrump or as they say never trump and paul just left and hes given us his total support and its all about unification were unifying the party and hopefully were going to be able to unify the country its very important to me ive been talking about that for a long time but its very very important to me so i want to thank paul singer for being here and for coming up to the office he was a very strong opponent and now hes a very strong ally and i appreciate thati think ill say a few words and then well take some questions and i had this time  weve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening and weve done some really good work were very proud of that and then right after that you prepare yourselves and well do some questions  unless you have no questions thats always a possibility im here today to update the american people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration we have made incredible progress i dont think theres ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what weve done a new rasmussen poll in fact  because the people get it much of the media doesnt get it they actually get it but they dont write it  lets put it that way but a new rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago and it has our approval rating at  percent and going up the stock market has hit record numbers as you know and there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world which is  to me means something much different than it used to it used to mean oh thats good now it means thats good for jobs very different plants and factories are already starting to move back into the united states and big league  ford general motors so many of them im making this presentation directly to the american people with the media present which is an honor to have you this morning because many of our nations reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve and i hope going forward we can be a little bit different and maybe get along a little bit better if thats possible maybe its not and thats okay toounfortunately much of the media in washington dc along with new york los angeles in particular speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very very obviously broken system the press has become so dishonest that if we dont talk about it we are doing a tremendous disservice to the american people  tremendous disservice we have to talk about it to find out whats going on because the press honestly is out of control the level of dishonesty is out of controli ran for president to represent the citizens of our country i am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well i am talking and really talking on this very entrenched power structure and what were doing is were talking about the power structure were talking about its entrenchment as a result the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort  not all the time  and some of the media is fantastic i have to say theyre honest and fantastic but much of it is not  the distortion and well talk about it and youll be able to ask me questions about itbut were not going to let it happen because im here again to take my message straight to the people as you know our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy to be honest i inherited a mess  its a mess  at home and abroad a mess jobs are pouring out of the country you see whats going on with all of the companies leaving our country going to mexico and other places  lowpay lowwages mass instability overseas no matter where you look the middle east a disaster north korea  well take care of it folks were going to take care of it all i just want to let you know i inherited a mess beginning on day one our administration went to work to tackle these challenges on foreign affairs weve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders  much of it youve covered  to move forward toward stability security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world which there are manyweve had great conversations with the united kingdom  and meetings  israel mexico japan china and canada really really productive conversations i would say far more productive than you would understand weve even developed a new council with canada to promote womens business leaders and entrepreneurs its very important to me very important to my daughter ivanka i have directed our defense community headed by our great general now secretary mattis  hes over there now working very hard  to submit a plan for the defeat of isis a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world it used to be a small group and now its in large sections of the world theyve spread like cancer isis has spread like cancer another mess i inherited and we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of iran whos totally taken advantage of our previous administration and theyre the worlds top sponsor of terrorism and were not going to stop until that problem is properly solved and its not properly solved now its one of the worst agreements ive ever seen drawn by anybody ive ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the united states military ive had great support from the senate ive had great support from congress generally weve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military and i will tell you that is my  i would be so happy if we never had to use it but our country will never have had a military like the military were about to build and rebuild we have the greatest people on earth in our military but they dont have the right equipment and their equipment is old i used it i talked about it at every stop depleted  its depleted it wont be depleted for long and i think one of the reasons im standing here instead of other people is that frankly i talked about we have to have a strong military we have to have strong law enforcement also so we do not go abroad in the search of war we really are searching for peace but its peace through strength at home we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many many years in each of these actions im keeping my promises to the american people these are campaign promises some people are so surprised that were having strong borders well thats what ive been talking about for a year and a half  strong borders theyre so surprised  oh youre having strong borders well thats what ive been talking about to the press and to everybody else one promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected they lie to the american people in order to get elected some of the things im doing probably arent popular but theyre necessary for security and for other reasons and then coming to washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politiciansim here following through on what i pledged to do thats all im doing i put it out before the american people got  electoral college votes i wasnt supposed to get  they said theres no way to get   is impossible two hundred and seventy which you need that was laughable we got  because people came out and voted like theyve never seen before so thats the way it goes i guess it was the biggest electoral college win since ronald reagan in other words the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and theyre not happy about it for whatever reason but a lot of people are happy about it in fact ill be in melbourne florida five oclock on saturday and i heard  just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there i turn on the tv open the newspapers and i see stories of chaos chaos yet it is the exact opposite this administration is running like a finetuned machine despite the fact that i cant get my cabinet approved and theyre outstanding people like senator dan coates whose there  one of the most respected men of the senate  he cant get approved how do you not approve him hes been a colleague highly respected  brilliant guy great guy everybody knows it  but waiting for approvalso we have a wonderful group of people thats working very hard thats being very much misrepresented about and we cant let that happen so if the democrats who have  all you have to do is look at where they are right now  the only thing they can do is delay because theyve screwed things up royally believe melet me list to you some of the things that weve done in just a short period of time i just got here i got here with no cabinet again each of these actions is a promise i made to the american people so well go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming weve withdrawn from the jobkilling disaster known as transpacific partnership were going to make trade deals but were going to have oneonone deals  bilateral were going to have oneonone dealsweve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for america and american infrastructure and that means plants equipment roads bridges factories people take    years to get disapproved for a factory they go in for a permit  its many many years and then at the end of the process  they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense  and at the end of the process they get rejected now they may be rejected with me but its going to be a quick rejection its not going to take years but mostly its going to be an acceptance we want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs we dont want the jobs going to other countries weve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers weve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations weve issued a gamechanging new rule that says for each one new regulation two old regulations must be eliminated makes sense nobody has ever seen regulations like we have if you go to other countries and you look at industries they have and you say let me see your regulations and theyre a fraction just a tiny fraction of what we have and i want regulations because i want safety i want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of its very important to me but you dont need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thingweve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence weve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in america including the horrendous situation  take a look at chicago and others  taking place right now in our inner cities horrible weve ordered the department of homeland security and justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the united states with drugs were becoming a druginfested nation drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars and were not going to let it happen any longer weve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border met with general now secretary kelly yesterday and were starting that process and the wall is going to be a great wall and its going to be a wall negotiated by me the price is going to come down just like it has on everything else ive negotiated for the government and were going to have a wall that works were not going to have a wall like they have now which is either nonexistent or a joke weve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens and weve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border no more release no matter who you are  release weve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens gang members drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety we are saving american lives every single day the court system has not made it easy for us and weve even created a new office in homeland security dedicated to the forgotten american victims of illegal immigrant violence of which there are manyweve taken decisive action to keep radical islamic terrorists out of our country though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judges in my opinion incorrect and unsafe ruling our administration is working night and day to keep you safe  including reporters safe  and is vigorously defending this lawful order i will not back down from defending our country i got elected on defense of our country and i keep my campaign promises and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result they already are i can tell you thatextreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places in fact we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number ive heard  percent  i find that hard to believe thats just a number i heard  that theyre overturned  percent of the time i think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil but we are appealing that and we are going further were issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country so well be going along the one path and hopefully winning that at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people and that will be done some time next week toward the beginning or middle at the latest partweve also taken steps to begin construction of the keystone pipeline and dakota access pipelines  thousands and thousands of jobs  and put new buy american measures in place to require american steel for american pipelines in other words they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen we want them to use american steel and theyre willing to do that but nobody ever asked before i came along even this order was drawn and they didnt say that and im reading the order im saying why arent we using american steel and they said thats a good idea we put it into drain the swamp of corruption in washington dc ive started by imposing a fiveyear lobbying ban on white house officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government weve begun preparing to repeal and replace obamacare obamacare is a disaster folks its a disaster you can say oh obamacare  i mean they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there but theyre not the republican people that our representatives are representing so weve begun preparing to repeal and replace obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back were bringing our jobs back to this country big league its already happening but big leagueive also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of senate democrats youve seen what theyve done over the last long number of years that will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in american history you look at rex tillerson  hes out there negotiating right now general mattis i mentioned before general kelly we have great great people mick is with us now we have great peopleamong their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens now look fair trade  not free  fair if a country is taking advantage of us were not going to let that happen anymore every country takes advantage of us almost i may be able to find a couple that dont but for the most part that would be a very tough job for me to do jobs have already started to surge since my election ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in mexico and will instead invest  million in michigan creating many many jobs fiatchrysler announced it will invest  billion in ohio and michigan creating  new american jobs they were with me a week ago you know  you were here general motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its american manufacturing operation keeping many jobs here that were going to leave and if i didnt get elected believe me they would have left and these jobs and these things that im announcing would never have come here intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with and that will result in at least  american jobs walmart announced it will create  jobs in the united states just this year because of our various plans and initiatives there will be many many more many more these are a few that were namingother countries have been taking advantage of us for decades  decades and decades and decades folks and were not going to let that happen anymore not going to let it happenand one more thing i have kept my promise to the american people by nominating a justice of the united states supreme court judge neil gorsuch who is from my list of  and who will be a true defender of our laws and our constitution  highly respected should get the votes from the democrats  you may not see that but hell get there one way or the other but he should get there the oldfashioned way and he should get those votesthis last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country again i say it  there has never been a presidency thats done so much in such a short period of time and we havent even started the big work that starts early next week some very big things are going to be announced next week so were just getting started we will be giving a speech as i said in melbourne florida at  pm i hope to see you there and with that id just say god bless america and lets take some questionsmara mara go ahead you were cut off pretty violently at our last news conferenceq  did you fire mike flynnthe president mike flynn is a fine person and i asked for his resignation he respectfully gave it he is a man who  there was a certain amount of information given to vice president pence who is with us today and i was not happy with the way that information was given he didnt have to do that because what he did wasnt wrong what he did in terms of the information he saw what was wrong was the way that other people including yourselves in this room were given that information because that was classified information that was given illegally thats the real problem and you can talk all you want about russia which was all a fake news fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the democrats and the press plays right into it in fact i saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this  they know nothing about it they werent in russia they never made a phone call to russia they never received a phone call its all fake news its all fake newsthe nice thing is i see it starting to turn where people are now looking at the illegal mara  and i think its very important  the illegal giving out classified information and let me just tell you it was given out like so much ill give you an example i called as you know mexico it was a very confidential classified call but i called mexico and in calling mexico i figured oh well thats  i spoke to the president of mexico had a good call all of a sudden its out for the world to see its supposed to be secret its supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case same thing with australia all of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place the same thing happened with respect to general flynn everybody saw this and im saying  the first thing i thought of when i heard about it is how does the press get this information thats classified how do they do it you know why because its an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves but more importantly the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves really ashamedyes go aheadq  why did you keep your vice president in the dark for almost two weeksthe president because when i looked at the information i said i dont think he did anything wrong if anything he did something right he was coming into office he looked at the information he said huh thats fine thats what theyre supposed to do theyre supposed to be  and he didnt just call russia he called and spoke to both ways  i think there were someodd countries hes doing the jobyou know he was just doing his job the thing is he didnt tell our vice president properly and then he said he didnt remember so either way it wasnt very satisfactory to me and i have somebody that i think will be outstanding for the position and that also helps i think in the making of my decisionbut he didnt tell the vice president of the united states the facts and then he didnt remember and that just wasnt acceptable to me yesq  president trump since you brought up russia im looking for some clarification here during the campaign did anyone from your team communicate with members of the russian government or russian intelligence and if so what was the nature of those conversations the president well the failing new york times wrote a big long frontpage story yesterday and it was very much discredited as you know it was  its a joke and the people mentioned in the story  i notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to russia they werent even a part really  i mean they were such a minor part  i hadnt spoken to them i think the one person i dont think ive ever spoken to him i dont think ive ever met him and he actually said he was a very lowlevel member of i think a committee for a short period of time i dont think i ever met him now its possible that i walked into a room and he was sitting there but i dont think i ever met him i didnt talk to him ever and he thought it was a jokethe other person said he never spoke to russia never received a call look at his phone records et cetera et cetera and the other person people knew that hed represented various countries but i dont think he represented russia  but knew that he represented various countries thats what he does i mean people know that thats mr manafort whos by the way  whos by the way a respected man hes a respected man but i think he represented the ukraine or ukraine government or somebody but everybody  people knew that everybody knew that so these people  and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with russia and he said that very forcefully i saw his statement he said it very forcefully most of the papers dont print it because thats not good for their stories so the three people that they talked about all totally deny it and i can tell you speaking for myself i own nothing in russia i have no loans in russia i dont have any deals in russia president putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election he then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration which was terrific but so did many other leaders  almost all other leaders from almost all other countries so thats the extentrussia is fake news russia  this is fake news put out by the media the real news is the fact that people probably from the obama administration because theyre there  because we have our new people going in place right now as you know mike pompeo is now taking control of the cia james comey at fbi dan coats is waiting to be approved i mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and hes still waiting to be approved but our new people are going in and just while youre at because you mentioned this wall street journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing new timess story yesterday and it talked about  you saw it front page so director of national intelligence just put out  acting  a statement any suggestion that the united states intelligence community  this was just given to us  is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not trueso they took this frontpage story out of the wall street journal  top  and they just wrote the story is not true and ill tell you something ill be honest  because i sort of enjoy this back and forth and i guess i have all my life but ive never seen more dishonest media than frankly the political media i thought the financial media was much better much more honest but i will say that i never get phone calls from the media how do they write a story like that in the wall street journal without asking me or how do they write a story in the new york times put it on front page that was like that story they wrote about the women and me  front page big massive story and it was nastyand then they called they said we never said that we like mr trump they called up my office  we like mr trump we never said that and it was totally  they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women i have to tell you  totally misrepresented i said give us a retraction they never gave us a retraction and frankly i then went on to other thingsgo ahead q  mr president the president you okayq  i am just wanted to get untangled very simply you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since ronald reagan with  or  electoral votes in fact president obama got  in the president well im talking about republican yesq  president obama  george hw bush  when he won as president so why should americans trust  the president well no i was told  i was given that information i dont know i was just given we had a very very big marginq  i guess my question is why should americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when youre providing information thats fakethe president well i dont know i was given that information i was given  actually ive seen that information around but it was a very substantial victory do you agree with thatq  youre the president the president okay thank you thats a good answer yesq  mr president thank you so much can you tell us in determining that lieutenant general flynn  there was no wrongdoing in your mind what evidence was weighed did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with russian officials particularly ambassador kislyak who he was communicating with what evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing and further than that sir youve said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaksthe president we areq  can we ask what youre doing to do and also weve heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by stephen feinberg what can you tell us about thatthe president well first of all about that we now have dan coats hopefully soon mike pompeo and james comey and theyre in position so i hope that well be able to straighten that out without using anybody else the gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man very successful man and he has offered his services and its something we may take advantage of but i dont think well need that at all because of the fact that i think that were going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its ownas far as the general is concerned when i first heard about it i said huh that doesnt sound wrong my counsel came  don mcgahn white house counsel  and he told me and i asked him and he can speak very well for himself he said he doesnt think anything is wrong he really didnt think  it was really what happened after that but he didnt think anything was done wrong i didnt either because i waited a period of time and i started to think about it i said well i dont see  to me he was doing the job the information was provided by  who i dont know  sally yates  and i was a little surprised because i said doesnt sound like he did anything wrong there but he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and i thought that was not acceptable as far as the actual making the call  in fact ive watched various programs and ive read various articles where he was just doing his job that was very normal at first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong after they thought about it it turned out he was just doing his jobso  and i do  and by the way with all of that being said i do think hes a fine man yes jonq  on the leaks sir the president go ahead finish off then ill get you jonq  sorry what will you do on the leaks you have said twice today the president yes were looking at it very very seriously ive gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and were  ive actually called the justice department to look into the leaks those are criminal leaks theyre put out by people either in agencies i think youll see it stopping because now we have our people in you know again we dont have our people in because we cant get them approved by the senate we just had jeff sessions approved in justice as an example so we are looking into that very seriously its a criminal act you know what i say  when i was called out on mexico i was shocked because all this equipment all this incredible phone equipment when i was called out on mexico i was  honestly i was really really surprised but i said you know it doesnt make sense that wont happen but that wasnt that important to call it was fine i could show it to the world and he could show it to the world  the president who is a very fine man by the way same thing with australia i said thats terrible that it was leaked but it wasnt that important but then i said what happens when im dealing with the problem of north korea what happens when im dealing with the problems in the middle east are you folks going to be reporting all of that very very confidential information  very important very  i mean at the highest level are you going to be reporting about that tooso i dont want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test so im dealing with mexico im dealing with argentina we were dealing on this case with mike flynn all this information gets put into the washington post and gets put into the new york times and im saying whats going to happen when im dealing on the middle east whats going to happen when im dealing with really really important subjects like north korea weve got to stop it thats why its a criminal penaltyyes jonq  thank you mr president i just want to get you to clarify just a very important point can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the russians during the campaign and on the leaks is it fake news or are these real leaksthe president well the leaks are real youre the one that wrote about them and reported them i mean the leaks are real you know what they said  you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real the news is fake because so much of the news is fake so one thing that i felt it was very important to do  and i hope we can correct it because there is nobody i have more respect for  well maybe a little bit  than reporters than good reporters its very important to me and especially in this position its very important i dont mind bad stories i can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as its true and over a course of time ill make mistakes and youll write badly and im okay with that but im not okay when it is fake i mean i watch cnn  its so much anger and hatred and just the hatred i dont watch it anymore because its very good  hes saying no its okay jim its okay jim youll have your chance but i watch others too youre not the only one so dont feel badlybut i think it should be straight i think it should be  i think it would be frankly more interesting i know how good everybodys ratings are right now but i think that actually would be  i think that it would actually be better people  i mean you have a lower approval rate than congress i think thats right i dont know peter is that one right because you know i think they have lower  i heard lower than congress but honestly the public would appreciate it id appreciate it again i dont mind bad stories when its true but we have an administration where the democrats are making it very difficult i think were setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet i mean the numbers are crazy when im looking  some of them had them approved immediately im going forever and i still have a lot of people that were waiting forand thats all theyre doing is delaying and you look at schumer and the mess that hes got over there and they have nothing going the only thing they can do is delay and you know i think theyd be better served by approving and making sure that theyre happy and everybody is good and sometimes i mean  i know president obama lost three or four and you lose them on the way and thats okay thats finebut i think they would be much better served jon if they just went through the process quickly this is pure delay tactics and they say it and everybody understands ityeah go ahead jimq  the first part of my question on contacts do you definitively say that nobody the president well i had nothing to do with it i have nothing to do with russia i told you i have no deals there i have no anythingnow when wikileaks which i had nothing to do with comes out and happens to give  theyre not giving classified information theyre giving stuff  what was said at an office about hillary cheating on the debates  which by the way nobody mentions nobody mentions that hillary received the questions to the debatescan you imagine  seriously can you imagine if i received the questions it would be the electric chair okay he should be put in the electric chair you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty okay maybe not you jonyes well do you next jim ill do you next yesq  thank you mr president i just want to clarify one other thingthe president sureq  did you direct mike flynn to discuss the sanctions with the russian ambassadorthe president no i didnt no i didnt q  inaudible off micthe president no i didnt q  did you fire him because inaudible the president excuse me  no i fired him because of what he said to mike pence very simple mike was doing his job he was calling countries and his counterparts so it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it i would have directed him to do it if i thought he wasnt doing it i didnt direct him but i would have directed him because thats his joband it came out that way  and in all fairness i watched dr charles krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and i agreed with him and since then ive watched many other people say thatno i didnt direct him but i would have directed him if he didnt do it okay jimq  mr president thank you very much and just for the record we dont hate you i dont hate you if you could pass that along the president okay well ask jeff zucker how he got his job okayq  if i may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far sir the president well not too many we do have other people you do have other people and your ratings arent as good as some of the other people that are waitingq  theyre pretty good right now actuallythe president okay go ahead jimq  if i may ask sir you said earlier that wikileaks was revealing information about the hillary clinton campaign during the election cycle you welcomed that at one pointthe president i was okay with itq  you said you loved wikileaks at another campaign press conference you called on the russians to find the missing  emails im wondering sir if you the president well she was actually missing  and then that got extended with a whole pile after that but thats okayq  maybe my numbers are off a little bit toothe president no no but i did say  but it was actually higher than thatq  if i may ask you sir it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaignthe president okay fair question readyq  so if i may ask you that  if i may ask a followup the president no no but are you  let me do one at a time do you mindq  yes sirthe president all right so in one case youre talking about highly classified information in the other case youre talking about john podesta saying bad things about the boss i will say this if john podesta said that about me and he was working for me i would have fired him so fast your head would have spun he said terrible things about her but it wasnt classified information but in one case youre talking about classified regardless if you look at the rnc we had a very strong  at my suggestion  and i give reince great credit for this  at my suggestion because i know something about this world i said i want a very strong defensive mechanism i dont want to be hacked and we did that and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failedthe dnc did not do that and if they did it they could not have been hacked but they were hacked and terrible things came and the only thing that i do think is unfair is some of the things were so  they were  when i heard some of those things i said  i picked up the papers the next morning i said oh this is going to front page it wasnt even in the papersagain if i had that happen to me it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers i would have been the headline in every newspaper i mean think of it they gave her the questions for the debate and she should have reported herself why didnt hillary clinton announce that im sorry but i have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall and i feel that its inappropriate and i want to turn in cnn for not doing a good jobq  and if i may follow up on that just something that jonathan karl was asking you about  you said that the leaks are real but the news is fake i guess i dont understand it seems that there is a disconnect there if the information coming from those leaks is real then how can the stories be fakethe president well the reporting is fake look look q  and if i may ask  i just want to ask one other question the president jim you know what it is heres the thing the public isnt  they read newspapers they see television they watch they dont know if its true or false because theyre not involved im involved ive been involved with this stuff all my life but im involved so i know when youre telling the truth or when youre not i just see many many untruthful things and i tell you what else i see i see tone you know the word tone the tone is such hatred im really not a bad person by the way no but the tone is such  i do get good ratings you have to admit that the tone is such hatred i watched this morning a couple of the networks and i have to say fox  friends in the morning theyre very honorable people theyre very  not because theyre good because they hit me also when i do something wrong but they have the most honest morning show thats all i can say its the most honest but the tone jim if you look  the hatred i mean sometimes  sometimes somebody gets q  off micthe president well you look at your show that goes on at  oclock in the evening you just take a look at that show that is a constant hit the panel is almost always exclusive antitrump the good news is he doesnt have good ratings but the panel is almost exclusive antitrump and the hatred and venom coming from his mouth the hatred coming from other people on your networknow i will say this i watch it i see it im amazed by it and i just think youd be a lot better off  i honestly do the public gets it you know look when i go to rallies they turn around they start screaming at cnn they want to throw their placards at cnn i think you would do much better by being different but you just take a look take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening if a guest comes out and says something positive about me its brutal now theyll take this news conference im actually having a very good time okay but theyll take this news conference  dont forget thats the way i won remember i used to give you a news conference every time i made a speech which was like every dayq  off micthe president no thats how i won i won with news conferences and probably speeches i certainly didnt win by people listening to you people thats for surebut i am having a good time tomorrow they will say donald trump rants and raves at the press im not ranting and raving im just telling you youre dishonest people but  but im not ranting and raving i love this im having a good time doing it but tomorrow the headlines are going to be donald trump rants and raves im not ranting and ravingq  if i may just the president go aheadq  one more followup because the president should i let him have a little bit more what do you think peter q  just because of this the president peter should i have let him have a little bit more sit down sit down q  just because of the attack the president well get it q  just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network i just want to ask you sir the president im changing it from fake news thoughq  doesnt that undermine the president very fake news now laughterq  but arent you the president yes go ahead q  real news mr president real newsthe president and youre not related to our new q  i am not related sir no laughter i do like the sound of secretary acosta i must saythe president i looked  you know i looked at that name i said wait a minute is there any relation there alex acostaq  im sure you checked that out sirthe president no i checked it i said  they said no sir i said do me a favor go back and check the family tree q  but arent you concerned sir that you are undermining the peoples faith in the first amendment freedom of the press the press in this country when you call stories you dont like fake news why not just say its a story i dont likethe president i do thatq  when you call it fake news youre undermining confidence the president no i do that no no i do thatq   in our news mediathe president heres the thing q  isnt that importantthe president okay i understand  and youre right about that except this see i know when i should get good and when i should get bad and sometimes ill say wow thats going to be a great story and ill get killed i know whats good and bad id be a pretty good reporter  not as good as you but i know whats good i know whats bad and when they change it and make it really bad  something that should be positive sometimes something that should be very positive theyll make okay theyll even make it negative so i understand it because im there i know what was said i know who is saying it im there so its very important to me look i want to see an honest press when i started off today by saying that its so important to the public to get an honest press the press  the public doesnt believe you people anymore now maybe i had something to do with that i dont know but they dont believe you if you were straight and really told it like it is as howard cosell used to say right of course he had some questions also but if you were straight i would be your biggest booster i would be your biggest fan in the world  including bad stories about me but if you go  as an example youre cnn  i mean its story after story after story is bad i won i won and the other thing chaos theres zero chaos we are running  this is a finetuned machine and reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press i said to him yesterday this whole russia scam that you guys are building so that you dont talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks but i watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper and im saying heres my chief of staff a really good guy did a phenomenal job at rnc i mean we won the election right we won the presidency we got some senators we got some  all over the country you take a look hes done a great joband i said to myself you know  and i said to somebody that was in the room  i said you take a look at reince hes working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires theyre fake theyre not true and isnt that a shame because hed rather be working on health care hed rather be working on tax reform jim i mean that i would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right i sort of understand theres a certain bias maybe by jeff or somebody  for whatever reason and i understand that but youve got to be at least a little bit fair and thats why the public sees it  they see it they see its not fair you take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred and the public is smart they understand it okay yeah go ahead q  we have no doubt that your latest story is inaudible but for those who believe that there is something to it is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isnt fake news and secondly the president i think they dont believe it i dont think the public would thats why the rasmussen poll just has me through the roof i dont think they believe it well i guess one of the reasons im here today is to tell you the whole russian thing  thats a ruse thats a ruse and by the way it would be great if we could get along with russia just so you understand that now tomorrow youll say donald trump wants to get along with russia this is terrible its not terrible  its goodwe had hillary clinton try and do a reset we had hillary clinton give russia  percent of the uranium in our country you know what uranium is right its this thing called nuclear weapons and other things like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things nobody talks about that i didnt do anything for russia ive done nothing for russia hillary clinton gave them  percent of our uranium hillary clinton did a reset remember with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks here take a look he looked at her like what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button hillary clinton  that was a reset remember it said resetnow if i do that oh im a bad guy if we could get along with russia thats a positive thing we have a very talented man rex tillerson who is going to be meeting with them shortly and i told him i said i know politically its probably not good for me hey the greatest thing i could do is shoot that ship thats  miles offshore right out of the water everyone in this country is going to say oh its so great thats not great thats not great i would love to be able to get along with russianow youve had a lot of presidents that havent taken that tact look where we are now look where we are now so if i can  now i love to negotiate things i do it really well and all that stuff but its possible i wont be able to get along with putin maybe it is but i want to just tell you the false reporting by the media by you people  the false horrible fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with russia and probably putin said you know  hes sitting behind his desk and hes saying you know i see whats going on in the united states i follow it closely its got to be impossible for president trump to ever get along with russia because of all the pressure hes got with this fake story okay and thats a shame because if we could get along with russia  and by the way china and japan and everyone  if we could get along it would be a positive thing not a negative thingq  tax reform q  mr president since you the president tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly were doing obamacare  were in final stages we should be submitting the initial plan in march early march i would say and we have to as you know statutorily and for reasons of budget we have to go first its not like  frankly the tax would be easier in my opinion but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons we have to submit the health care sooner so well be submitting health care sometime in early march midmarch and after that were going to come up  and were doing very well on tax reformyesq  mr president you mentioned russia lets talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the united statesthe president okayq  you mentioned the vessel the spy vessel off the coast of the united statesthe president not goodq  there was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation the president not goodq   of the agreement between the two countries and a russian plane buzzed a us destroyer the president not goodq  i listened to you during the campaign the president excuse me excuse me when did it happen it happened when  if you were putin right now you would say hey were back to the old games with the united states theres no way trump can ever do a deal with us because the  you have to understand if i was just brutal on russia right now just brutal people would say you would say oh isnt that wonderful but i know you well enough then you would say oh he was too tough he shouldnt have done that look of all q  im just trying to find out your orientation to those the president wait a minute wait wait excuse me just one second q  im just trying to find out what youre doing to do about them mr presidentthe president all of those things that you mentioned are very recent because probably putin assumes that hes not going to be able to make a deal with me because its politically not popular for me to make a deal so hillary clinton tries to reset it failed they all tried but im different than those peoplego aheadq  how are you interpreting those moves and what do you intend to do about themthe president just the way i said itq  have you given rex tillerson any advice or counsel on how to dealthe president i have i have and im so beautifully represented im so honored that the senate approved him hes going to be fantasticyes i think that ive already q  is putin testing you do you believe sirthe president no i dont think so i think putin probably assumes that he cant make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal i cant believe im saying im a politician but i guess thats what i am now because look it would be much easier for me to be tough on russia but then were not going to make a dealnow i dont know that were going to make a deal i dont know we might we might not but it would be much easier for me to be so tough  the tougher i am on russia the better but you know what i want to do the right thing for the american people and to be honest secondarily i want to do the right thing for the worldif russia and the united states actually got together and got along  and dont forget were a very powerful nuclear country and so are they theres no upside were a very powerful nuclear country and so are they ive been briefed and i can tell you one thing about a briefing that were allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it nuclear holocaust would be like no other theyre a very powerful nuclear country and so are weif we have a good relationship with russia believe me thats a good thing not a bad thingq  so when you say theyre not good do you mean that they are the president who did i say is not goodq  no when i read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said theyre not goodthe president no its not good but they happenedq  but do they damage the relationship do they undermine this countrys ability to work with russiathe president they all happened recently and i understand what theyre doing because theyre doing the same thing now again maybe im not going to be able to do a deal with russia but at least i will have tried and if i dont does anybody really think that hillary clinton would be tougher on russia than donald trump does anybody in this room really believe that okaybut i tell you one thing she tried to make a deal she had the reset she gave all the valuable uranium away she did other things you know they say im close to russia hillary clinton gave away  percent of the uranium in the united states shes close to russia i gave  you know what i gave to russia you know what i gave nothingq  can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocationsthe president im not going to tell you anything about what response i do i dont talk about military response i dont say im going into mosul in four months we are going to attack mosul in four months then three months later we are going to attack mosul in one month next week we are going to attack mosul in the meantime mosul is very very difficult do you know why because i dont talk about military and i dont talk about certain other things youre going to be surprised to hear that and by the way my whole campaign id say that so i dont have to tell you q  there will be a responsethe president i dont want to be one of these guys that say yes heres what were going to do i dont have to do thatq  there will be a  in other words there will be a response mr president the president i dont have to tell you what im going to do in north korea wait a minute i dont have to tell you what im going to do in north korea and i dont have to tell you what im going to do with iran you know why because they shouldnt know and eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question so when you ask me what am i going to do with the ship  the russian ship as an example  im not going to tell you but hopefully i wont have to do anything but im not going to tell you okayq  thanksq  can i just ask you  thank you very much mr president  the trump the president where are you fromq  bbcthe president okay heres another beautyq  thats a good line impartial free and fairthe president yeah sureq  mr president the president just like cnn rightq  mr president on the travel ban  we could banter back and forth on the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government that finetuned the president yeah i do i do  and let me tell you about the travel q  were there any mistakes in thatthe president wait wait wait i know who you are just wait let me tell you about the travel ban we had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban but we had a bad court we got a bad decision we had a court thats been overturned  again maybe wrong but i think its  percent of the time a lot we had a bad decision were going to keep going with that decision were going to put in a new executive order next week sometime but we had a bad decision thats the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban you had delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports you had some people that were put out there brought by very nice buses and they were put out at various locations despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court we had a court that gave us what i consider to be with great respect a very bad decision very bad for the safety and security of our country the rollout was perfectnow what i wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing  and i said this to my people give them a onemonth period of time but general kelly now secretary kelly said if you do that all these people will come in in the month  the bad ones you do agree there are bad people out there right theyre not everybody thats like you you have some bad people out there so kelly said you cant do that and he was right as soon as he said it i said wow never thought of it i said how about one week he said no good you got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they dont have time to come in now nobody ever reports that but thats why we did it quicklynow if would have done it a month everything would have been perfect the problems is we would have wasted a lot of time and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would have come into our countrynow in the meantime weve vetting very very strongly very very strongly but we need help and we need help by getting that executive order passedq  just a brief followup and if its so urgent why not introduce the president yes go aheadq  thank you i just was hoping that we could get a yes orno answer on one of these questions involving russia can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with russia during the course of the electionthe president well i told you general flynn obviously was dealing so thats one person but he was dealing  as he should have been q  during the electionthe president no no nobody that i know ofq  so youre not aware of any contacts during the course of the electionthe president look look how many times do i have to answer this question q  can you just say yes or no on itthe president russia is a ruse yeah i know you have to get up and ask a question so important russia is a ruse i have nothing to do with russia havent made a phone call to russia in years dont speak to people from russia not that i wouldnt i just have nobody to speak to i spoke to putin twice he called me on the election  i told you this  and he called me on the inauguration and a few days ago we had a very good talk especially the second one  lasted for a pretty long period of time im sure you probably get it because it was classified so im sure everybody in this room perhaps has it but we had a very very good talk i have nothing to do with russia to the best of my knowledge no person that i deal with does now manafort has totally denied it he denied it now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while but not for russia i think he represented ukraine or people having to do with ukraine or people that  whoever but people knew that everybody knew thatq  but in his capacity as your campaign manager was he in touch with russian officials during the electionthe president i have  you know what he said no i can only tell you what he  now he was replaced long before the election you know that right he was replaced long before the election when all of this stuff started coming out it came out during the election but paul manafort whos a good man also by the way  paul manafort was replaced long before the election took place he was only there for a short period of timehow much longer should we stay here folks five more minutes is that okay five q  mr president on national security the president wait lets see whos  i want to find a friendly reporter are you a friendly reporter watch how friendly he is wait wait  watch how friendly he is go ahead go aheadq  so first of all my name is inaudible from inaudible magazine and inaudible i havent seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the  anyone on your staff of being antisemitic we have an understanding of inaudiblethe president thank youq  however what we are concerned about and what we havent really heard be addressed is an uptick in antisemitism and how the government is planning to take care of it there have been reports out that  bomb threats have been made against jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks there are people who are committing antisemitic acts or threatening to the president you see he said he was going to ask a very simple easy question and its not its not not a simple question not a fair question okay sit down i understand the rest of your question so heres the story folks number one i am the least antisemitic person that youve ever seen in your entire life number two racism  the least racist person in fact we did very well relative to other people running as a republican q  inaudiblethe president quiet quiet quiet see he lied about  he was going to get up and ask a very straight simple question so you know welcome to the world of the media but let me just tell you something  that i hate the charge i find it repulsive i hate even the question because people that know me  and you heard the prime minister you heard netanyahu yesterday  did you hear him bibi he said ive known donald trump for a long time and then he said forget itso you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like thatyeah go ahead go aheadq  thank you im lisa from the pbs the president see it just shows you about the press but thats the way the press is q  thank you mr president lisa desjardins from the pbs newshourthe president goodq  on national security and immigration can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week even its broad outlines will it be focused on specific countriesthe president its a very fair questionq  and in addition on the daca program for immigration what is your plan do you plan to continue that program or to end itthe president were going to show great heart daca is a very very difficult subject for me i will tell you to me its one of the most difficult subjects i have because you have these incredible kids in many cases  not in all cases in some of the cases theyre having daca and theyre gang members and theyre drug dealers too but you have some absolutely incredible kids  i would say mostly  they were brought here in such a way  its a very very tough subjectwe are going to deal with daca with heart i have to deal with a lot of politicians dont forget and i have to convince them that what im saying is right and i appreciate your understanding on thatbut the daca situation is a very very  its a very difficult thing for me because you know i love these kids i love kids i have kids and grandkids and i find it very very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know the law is rough im not talking about new laws im talking the existing law is very rough its very very rough as far as the new order the new order is going to be very much tailored to what i consider to be a very bad decision but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything in some ways more but were tailoring it now to the decision we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it and the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court okayq  mr president melania trump announced the reopening of the white house visitors office the president yesq  and she does a lot of great work for the country as well can you tell us a little bit about what first lady melania trump does for the country and there is a unique level of interest in your administration so by opening the white house visitors office what does that mean to youthe president now thats what i call a nice question that is very nice who are you withq  inaudiblethe president good im going to start watching thank you very muchmelania is terrific she was here last night we had dinner with senator rubio and his wife who is by the way lovely and we had a really good discussion about cuba because we have very similar views on cuba and cuba was very good to me in the florida election as you know the cuban people americans and i think that melania is going to be outstanding thats right she just opened up the visitors center  in other words touring of the white house she like others that shes working with feels very very strongly about womens issues womens difficulties very very strongly and shes a very very strong advocate i think shes a great representative for this country and a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned the things they say  ive known her for a long time she was a very successful person she was a very successful model she did really well she would go home at night and didnt even want to go out with people she was a very private person she was always the highest quality that youll ever find and the things they say  and ive known her for a long time  the things they say are so unfair and actually shes been apologized to as you know by various media because they said things that were liesid just tell you this i think shes going to be a fantastic first lady shes going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people and helping her and working with her will be ivanka who is a fabulous person and a fabulous fabulous woman and theyre not doing this for money theyre not doing this for pay theyre doing this because they feel it both of them and melania goes back and forth and after barron finishes school  because its hard to take a child out of school with a few months left  she and barron will be moving over to the white house thank you thats a very nice questiongo aheadq  mr presidentthe president yes oh this is going to be a bad question but thats okayq  no its not going to be a bad questionthe president good because i enjoy watching you on televisionq  well thank you so much mr president i need to find out from you  you said something as it relates to inner cities that was one of your platforms during your campaignthe president fix the inner cities yesq  fixing the inner cities what will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your hbcu executive order thats coming out this afternoon see it wasnt bad was itthe president that was very professional and very goodq  im very professionalthe president well be announcing the order in a little while and id rather let the order speak for itself but it will be something i think that will be very good for everybody concerned but well talk to you about that after we do the announcementas far as the inner cities as you know i was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign i think its probably what got me a much higher percentage of the african american vote than a lot of people thought i was going to get we did much higher than people thought i was going to get and i was honored by that including the hispanic vote which was also much higher and by the way if i might add including the womens vote which was much higher than people thought i was going to getso we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education having to do with crime were going to try and fix as quickly as possible  you know it takes a long time its taken  years or more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved many of them very badlybut were going to be working very hard on health and health care very very hard on education and also were going to working in a stringent way and a very good way on crime you go to some of these inner city places and its so sad when you look at the crime you have people  and ive seen this and ive sort of witnessed it in fact in two cases i have actually witnessed it they lock themselves into apartments petrified to even leave in the middle of the day theyre living in hell we cant let that happen so were going to be very very strongits a great question and its a very difficult situation because its been many many years its been festering for many many years but we have places in this country that we have to fix we have to help african american people that for the most part are stuck there  hispanic american people we have hispanic american people that are in the inner cities and theyre living in helli mean you look at the numbers in chicago there are two chicagos as you know theres one chicago thats incredible luxurious and all and safe theres another chicago thats worse than almost any of the places in the middle east that we talk about and that you talk about every night on the newscasts so were going to do a lot of work on the inner cities i have great people lined up to help with the inner citiesq  well when you say  when you say the inner cities are you going to include the cbc mr president in your conversations with your urban agenda your inner city agenda as well as your the president am i going include whoq  are you going to include the congressional black caucus

it might be bad for me politically i cant have that meeting i was all set to have the meeting you know we called him and called him and he was all set i spoke to him on the phone very nice guyq  i hear he wanted that meeting with you as wellthe president he wanted it but we called called called called  they cant make a meeting with him every day i walked in i said i would like to meet with him because i do want to solve the problem but he probably was told by schumer or somebody like that  some other lightweight  he was probably told  he was probably told dont meet with trump its bad politics and thats part of the problem of this countryokay one more go aheadq  yes mr president two questions the president no no one question two we cant handle this room cant handle two go ahead give me the better of your twoq  inaudible its not about your personality or your beliefs were talking about inaudible around the country some of it by supporters in your name what do you the president and some of it  and can i be honest with you and this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up some of it written by our opponents you do know that do you understand that you dont think anybody would do a thing like that some of the signs youll see are not put up by the people that love or like donald trump theyre put up by the other side and you think its like playing it straight no but you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side theyll do signs and theyll do drawings that are inappropriate it wont be my people it will be the people on the other side to anger people like you okaygo aheadq  you are the president now what are you going to do about itthe president who is that where is that oh stand up you can q  what are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussedthe president oh im working on it no im working on it very hard q  are you going to give a speechthe president no no look hey just so you understand we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that in all fairness to president obama long before president obama we have had a very divided i didnt come along and divide this country this country was seriously divided before i got here were going to work on it very hard one of the questions that was asked  i thought it was a very good question  was about the inner cities i mean thats part of it but were going to work on education were going to work on lack  you know were going to stop  were going to try and stop the crime we have great law enforcement officials were going to try and stop crime were not going to try and stop were going to stop crimebut its very important to me but this isnt donald trump that divided a nation we went eight years with president

2017-02-15,Remarks by President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel in Joint Press Conference  ,as prepared by white house stenographer in real timeeast room pm estpresident trump thank you very much thank you today i have the honor of welcoming my friend prime minister benjamin netanyahu to the white house with this visit the united states again reaffirms our unbreakable bond with our cherished ally israel the partnership between our two countries built on our shared values has advanced the cause of human freedom dignity and peace these are the building blocks of democracy the state of israel is a symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression  i can think of no other state thats gone through what theyve gone  and of survival in the face of genocide we will never forget what the jewish people have endured your perseverance in the face of hostility your open democracy in the face of violence and your success in the face of tall odds is truly inspirational the security challenges faced by israel are enormous including the threat of irans nuclear ambitions which ive talked a lot about one of the worst deals ive ever seen is the iran deal my administration has already imposed new sanctions on iran and i will do more to prevent iran from ever developing  i mean ever  a nuclear weaponour security assistance to israel is currently at an alltime high ensuring that israel has the ability to defend itself from threats of which there are unfortunately many both of our countries will continue and grow we have a long history of cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the fight against those who do not value human life america and israel are two nations that cherish the value of all human lifethis is one more reason why i reject unfair and onesided actions against israel at the united nations  just treated israel in my opinion very very unfairly  or other international forums as well as boycotts that target israel our administration is committed to working with israel and our common allies in the region towards greater security and stability that includes working toward a peace agreement between israel and the palestinians the united states will encourage a peace and really a great peace deal well be working on it very very diligently very important to me also  something we want to do but it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement well be beside them well be working with themas with any successful negotiation both sides will have to make compromises you know that right laughter prime minister netanyahu both sidespresident trump i want the israeli people to know that the united states stands with israel in the struggle against terrorism as you know mr prime minister our two nations will always condemn terrorist acts peace requires nations to uphold the dignity of human life and to be a voice for all of those who are endangered and forgotten those are the ideals to which we all and will always aspire and commit this will be the first of many productive meetings and i again mr prime minister thank you very much for being with us today mr prime minister thank youprime minister netanyahu president trump thank you for the truly warm hospitality you and melania have shown me my wife sara our entire delegation i deeply value your friendship to me to the state of israel it was so clearly evident in the words you just spoke  israel has no better ally than the united states and i want to assure you the united states has no better ally than israelour alliance has been remarkably strong but under your leadership im confident it will get even stronger i look forward to working with you to dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field  in security in technology in cyber and trade and so many others and i certainly welcome your forthright call to ensure that israel is treated fairly in international forums and that the slander and boycotts of israel are resisted mightily by the power and moral position of the united states of americaas you have said our alliance is based on a deep bond of common values and common interests and increasingly those values and interests are under attack by one malevolent force radical islamic terror mr president youve shown great clarity and courage in confronting this challenge headon you call for confronting irans terrorist regime preventing iran from realizing this terrible deal into a nuclear arsenal and you have said that the united states is committed to preventing iran from getting nuclear weapons you call for the defeat of isis under your leadership i believe we can reverse the rising tide of radical islam and in this great task as in so many others israel stands with you and i stand with youmr president in rolling back militant islam we can seize an historic opportunity  because for the first time in my lifetime and for the first time in the life of my country arab countries in the region do not see israel as an enemy but increasingly as an ally and i believe that under your leadership this change in our region creates an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen security and advance peacelet us seize this moment together let us bolster security let us seek new avenues of peace and let us bring the remarkable alliance between israel and the united states to even greater heights thank you thank you mr presidentpresident trump thank you again thank you well take a couple of questions david brody christian broadcasting davidq  thank you mr president mr prime minister both of you have criticized the iran nuclear deal and at times even called for its repeal im wondering if youre concerned at all as it relates to not just the national security advisor michael flynn who is recently no longer here but also some of those events that have been going on with communication in russia  if that is going to hamper this deal at all and whether or not it would keep iran from becoming a nuclear state and secondly on the settlement issue are you both on the same page how do you exactly term that as it relates to the settlement issue thank youpresident trump michael flynn general flynn is a wonderful man i think hes been treated very very unfairly by the media  as i call it the fake media in many cases and i think its really a sad thing that he was treated so badly i think in addition to that from intelligence  papers are being leaked things are being leaked its criminal actions criminal act and its been going on for a long time  before me but now its really going on and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the democrats had under hillary clinton i think its very very unfair whats happened to general flynn the way he was treated and the documents and papers that were illegally  i stress that  illegally leaked very very unfairas far as settlements id like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit well work something out but i would like to see a deal be made i think a deal will be made i know that every president would like to most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible and it wasnt possible because they didnt do itbut bibi and i have known each other a long time  a smart man great negotiator and i think were going to make a deal it might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand thats a possibility so lets see what we doprime minister netanyahu lets try itpresident trump doesnt sound too optimistic but  laughter  hes a good negotiatorprime minister netanyahu thats the art of the deal laughter president trump i also want to thank  i also want to thank  sara could you please stand up youre so lovely and youve been so nice to melania i appreciate it very much applause thank you your turnprime minister netanyahu yes please go aheadq  thank you very much mr president in your vision for the new middle east peace are you ready to give up the notion of twostate solution that was adopted by previous administration and will you be willing to hear different ideas from the prime minister as some of his partners are asking him to do for example annexation of parts of the west bank and unrestricted settlement constructions and one more question are you going to fulfill your promise to move the us embassy in israel to jerusalem and if so whenand mr prime minister did you come here tonight to tell the president that youre backing off the twostate solutionthank youpresident trump so im looking at twostate and onestate and i like the one that both parties like laughter im very happy with the one that both parties like i can live with either one i thought for a while the twostate looked like it may be the easier of the two but honestly if bibi and if the palestinians  if israel and the palestinians are happy im happy with the one they like the best as far as the embassy moving to jerusalem id love to see that happen were looking at it very very strongly were looking at it with great care  great care believe me and well see what happens okayprime minister netanyahu thank you i read yesterday that an american official said that if you ask five people what two states would look like youd get eight different answers mr president if you ask five israelis youd get  different answers laughterbut rather than deal with labels i want to deal with substance its something ive hoped to do for years in a world thats absolutely fixated on labels and not on substance so heres the substance there are two prerequisites for peace that i laid out two years  several years ago and they havent changedfirst the palestinians must recognize the jewish state they have to stop calling for israels destruction they have to stop educating their people for israels destructionsecond in any peace agreement israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the jordan river because if we dont we know what will happen  because otherwise well get another radical islamic terrorist state in the palestinian areas exploding the peace exploding the middle eastnow unfortunately the palestinians vehemently reject both prerequisites for peace first they continue to call for israels destruction  inside their schools inside their mosques inside the textbooks you have to read it to believe it they even deny mr president our historical connection to our homeland and i suppose you have to ask yourself why do   why are jews called jews well the chinese are called chinese because they come from china the japanese are called japanese because they come from japan well jews are called jews because they come from judea this is our ancestral homeland jews are not foreign colonialists in judeaso unfortunately the palestinians not only deny the past they also poison the present they name public squares in honor of mass murderers who murdered israelis and i have to say also murdered americans they fund  they pay monthly salaries to the families of murderers like the family of the terrorist who killed taylor force a wonderful young american a west point graduate who was stabbed to death while visiting israelso this is the source of the conflict  the persistent palestinian refusal to recognize the jewish state in any boundary this persistent rejection thats the reason we dont have peace now that has to change i want it to change not only have i not abandoned these two prerequisites of peace theyve become even more important because of the rising tide of fanaticism that has swept the middle east and has also unfortunately infected palestinian societyso i want this to change i want those two prerequisites of peace  substance not labels  i want them reinstated but if anyone believes that i as prime minister of israel responsible for the security of my country would blindly walk into a palestinian terrorist state that seeks the destruction of my country theyre gravely mistaken the two prerequisites of peace  recognition of the jewish state and israels security needs west of the jordan  they remain pertinent we have to look for new ways new ideas on how to reinstate them and how to move peace forward and i believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach from involving our newfound arab partners in the pursuit of a broader peace and peace with the palestinians and i greatly look forward to discussing this in detail with you mr president because i think that if we work together we have a shotpresident trump and we have been discussing that and it is something that is very different hasnt been discussed before and its actually a much bigger deal a much more important deal in a sense it would take in many many countries and it would cover a very large territory so i didnt know you were going to be mentioning that but thats  now that you did i think its a terrific thing and i think we have some pretty good cooperation from people that in the past would never ever have even thought about doing this so well see how that works outkatie from townhall wheres katie right there katieq  thank you mr president you said in your earlier remarks that both sides will have to make compromises when it comes to a peace deal youve mentioned a halt on settlements can you lay out a few more specific compromises that you have in mind both for the israelis and for the palestinians and mr prime minister what expectations do you have from the new administration about how to either amend the iran nuclear agreement or how to dismantle it altogether and how to overall work with the new administration to combat irans increased aggression not only in the last couple of months but the past couple of years as wellpresident trump its actually an interesting question i think that the israelis are going to have to show some flexibility which is hard its hard to do theyre going to have to show the fact that they really want to make a deal i think our new concept that weve been discussing actually for a while is something that allows them to show more flexibility than they have in the past because you have a lot bigger canvas to play with and i think theyll do that i think they very much would like to make a deal or i wouldnt be happy and i wouldnt be here and i wouldnt be as optimistic as i am i really think they  i can tell you from the standpoint of bibi and from the standpoint of israel i really believe they want to make a deal and theyd like to see the big deali think the palestinians have to get rid of some of that hate that theyre taught from a very young age theyre taught tremendous hate ive seen what theyre taught and you can talk about flexibility there too but it starts at a very young age and it starts in the school room and they have to acknowledge israel  theyre going to have to do that theres no way a deal can be made if theyre not ready to acknowledge a very very great and important country and i think theyre going to be willing to do that also but now i also believe were going to have katie other players at a very high level and i think it might make it easier on both the palestinians and israel to get something doneokay thank you very interesting question thank youprime minister netanyahu you asked about iran one thing is preventing iran from getting nuclear weapons  something that president trump and i think are deeply committed to do and we are obviously going to discuss that i think beyond that president trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks just coming into the presidency he pointed out there are violations iranian violations on ballistic missile tests by the way these ballistic missiles are inscribed in hebrew israel must be destroyed the palestinian  rather the iranian foreign minister zarif said well our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country no they write on the missile in hebrew israel must be destroyed so challenging iran on its violations of ballistic missiles imposing sanctions on hezbollah preventing them making them pay for the terrorism that they foment throughout the middle east and beyond well beyond  i think thats a change that is clearly evident since president trump took office i welcome that i think its  let me say this very openly i think its long overdue and i think that if we work together  and not just the united states and israel but so many others in the region who see eye to eye on the great magnitude and danger of the iranian threat then i think we can roll back irans aggression and danger and thats something that is important for israel the arab states but i think its vitally important for america these guys are developing icbms theyre developing  they want to get to a nuclear arsenal not a bomb a hundred bombs and they want to have the ability to launch them everywhere on earth and including and especially eventually the united states so this is something that is important for all of us i welcome the change and i intend to work with president trump very closely so that we can thwart this dangerpresident trump great do you have somebodyprime minister netanyahu moav phq  mr president since your election campaign and even after your victory weve seen a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents across the united states and i wonder what you say to those among the jewish community in the states and in israel and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tonesand mr prime minister do you agree to what the president just said about the need for israel to restrain or to stop settlement activity in the west bank and a quick followup on my friends questions  simple question do you back off from your vision to the end of the conflict of twostate solution as you laid out in barilan speech or you still support it thank youpresident trump well i just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had   electoral college votes we were not supposed to crack  you know that right there was no way to  but then they said theres no way to  and theres tremendous enthusiasm out there i will say that we are going to have peace in this country we are going to stop crime in this country we are going to do everything within our power to stop longsimmering racism and every other thing thats going on because lot of bad things have been taking place over a long period of time i think one of the reasons i won the election is we have a very very divided nation very divided and hopefully ill be able to do something about that and you know it was something that was very important to meas far as people  jewish people  so many friends a daughter who happens to be here right now a soninlaw and three beautiful grandchildren i think that youre going to see a lot different united states of america over the next three four or eight years i think a lot of good things are happening and youre going to see a lot of love youre going to see a lot of love okay thank youprime minister netanyahu i believe that the issue of the settlements is not the core of the conflict nor does it really drive the conflict i think its an issue it has to be resolved in the context of peace negotiations and i think we also are going to speak about it president trump and i so we can arrive at an understanding so we dont keep on bumping into each other all the time on this issue and were going to discuss thison the question you said you just came back with your question to the problem that i said its the label what does abu mazen mean by two states okay what does he mean a state that doesnt recognize the jewish state a state that basically is open for attack against israel what are we talking about are we talking about costa rica or are we talking about another iranso obviously it means different things i told you what are the conditions that i believe are necessary for an agreement its the recognition of the jewish state and its israels  israels  security control of the entire area otherwise were just fantasizing otherwise well get another failed state another terrorist islamist dictatorship that will not work for peace but work to destroy us but also destroy any hope  any hope  for a peaceful future for our people so ive been very clear about those conditions and they havent changed i havent changed if you read what i said eight years ago its exactly that and i repeated that again and again and again if you want to deal with labels deal with labels ill deal with substanceand finally if i can respond to something that i know from personal experience ive known president trump for many years and to allude to him or to his people  his team some of whom ive known for many years too can i reveal jared how long weve known you laughter well he was never small he was always big he was always tall but ive known the president and ive known his family and his team for a long time and there is no greater supporter of the jewish people and the jewish state than president donald

2017-02-14,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/14/2017, #12 ",james s brady press briefing room pm estmr spicer good afternoon happy valentines day i can sense the love in the room laughter first off last night the treasury departments office of foreign asset control  ofac  labeled the venezuelan vice president as a specially designated narcotics trafficker under the kingpin act before i continue with the briefing and look forward to your questions i want to turn it over for a short time to newly minted secretary of the treasury steven mnuchin to issue a brief statement on this and deliver a few questionssecretary mnuchinsecretary mnuchin pleasure to be here on my first busy day in office yesterday the department of treasurys office of foreign asset control known as ofac designated venezuelan national tareck el aissami as a specially designated narcotics trafficker pursuant to the foreign narcotics kingpin designation act for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking el aissamis primary frontman venezuelan national samark lopez bellow was also designatedthese designations follow a multiyear investigation into el aissamis criminal activities and president trump appreciates the hard work put into this case by the department of treasury the department of state as well as the national security council and many people throughout law enforcementfollowing the signing of the executive order last week designing to break the back of criminal drug cartels this action demonstrates the presidents seriousness about fighting the scourge of drugs in the united states in addition he wants to send a clear message to the people of venezuela that america stands with them and with that im happy to take two or three questions specifically about thisq  secretary mnuchin since sanctions are directly relevant obviously to the treasury department which is an agency that you now oversee can you talk a little bit about plans to sanction russia and if youll keep obamaera sanctions against russiasecretary mnuchin our current sanctions programs are in place and i would say sanctions are an important tool that we will continue to look at for various different countries but its a very important program within the treasury departmentq  and for russia specificallysecretary mnuchin the existing policies are in placeq  mr secretary are you contemplating any additional sanctions against iran and can you tell us what you think the bottom line will be at these particular sanctions you announced yesterday and are referring to today with the venezuelan vice president whats it going to meansecretary mnuchin well first let me just comment  again this is as a result of a very long effort q  did you inaudible the implication by the waysecretary mnuchin yes this was underway this was a very long effort but the implication is quite significant we expect that there will be frozen tens of millions of dollars and again that sanctions are a very important way of us sending a message that we will not stand for illicit activities whether theyre drug trafficking or terrorismq  on iran sirq  secretary including sanctions what other tools are you looking atsecretary mnuchin i cant comment on all the tools but again let me just reinforce that sanctions are a very important tool within the department and we will use them as appropriateq  what about freezing assetssecretary mnuchin in this case we did freeze assets  again as i mentioned tens of millions of dollars of assets and that will have a very big impact on thisso ill take one more question please yes in the backq  during the campaign the president had made comments about janet yellen and whether  basically inferring that she was being too political and that she should be ashamed of herself do the folks at the treasury department and within the administration feel confident with mrs yellen at the helm and to be able to set monetary policy going forwardsecretary mnuchin well let me just comment im really here today again to talk about the venezuelan situation but let me just say that there is a tradition of the secretary of treasury having ongoing meetings with the head of the federal reserve and i look forward to that now that im in office doing that and spending time with herthank you very much everybody its a pleasure to be here on my first day mr spicer all right lets get back to the fun weve been reviewing  and i want to address the events of last night first and foremost weve been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to general flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks trying to ascertain the truth we got to a point not based on a legal issue but based on a trust issue where a level of trust between the president and general flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a changethe president was very concerned that general flynn had misled the vice president and others he was also very concerned in light of sensitive subjects dealt with by that position of national security advisors  like china north korea and the middle east  that the president must have complete and unwavering trust for the person in that positionthe evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the president to ask for general flynns resignation immediately after the department of justice notified the white house counsel of the situation the white house counsel briefed the president and a small group of senior advisors the white house counsel reviewed and determined that there is not a legal issue but rather a trust issueduring this process its important to note that the president did not have his attorney general jeff sessions who he trusts immensely approved by the senate when the president heard the information as presented by white house counsel he instinctively thought that general flynn did not do anything wrong and the white house counsels review corroborated thatit is not ordinary unordinary for an incoming national security advisor to speak with his counterparts about the issues of concern to them in fact he spoke with over  of his counterparts throughout the transition as charles krauthammer said last night it is perfectly reasonable for him to do so the issue here was that the president got to the point where general flynns relationship  misleading the vice president and others or the possibility that he had forgotten critical details of this important conversation had created a critical mass and an unsustainable situationthats why the president decided to ask for his resignation and he got it the irony of this entire situation is that the president has been incredibly tough on russia he continues to raise the issue of crimea which the previous administration had allowed to be seized by russia his ambassador to the united nations nikki haley stood before the un security council on her first day and strongly denounced the russian occupation of crimea as ambassador haley said at the time the dire situation in eastern ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of russian actions president trump has made it very clear that he expects the russian government to deescalate violence in the ukraine and return crimea at the same time he fully expects to and wants to be able to get along with russia unlike previous administrations so that we can solve many problems together facing the world such as the threat of isis and terrorismthe president is currently evaluating a group of very strong candidates that will be considered to fill the national security advisor position permanently and is confident in the ability of general kellogg a decorated and distinguished veteran of the united states army until that person is ultimately chosenbefore i get into the presidents schedule for today a quick recap of the presidents activity over the last few days since we havent had the honor of spending so much time togetherthe president has been keeping a close eye on the oroville dam situation in california weve worked closely with doug lamalfa who represents californias first district where the dam is located and other state officials to help people who have been impacted the situation is a textbook example of why we need to pursue a major

overhaul of our nations crumbling infrastructurewe hope everyone remains safe as the evacuations continue and well be working alongside with fema and appropriate government entities to make sure that

regulations such as the sec rule addressed by hjr  inflict real cost on the american people and put our businesses especially small businesses at a significant disadvantage its a priority for the

boeing americas numberone exporter and the millions of american workers involved in aerospace this trip has been months in the making and were thrilled to celebrate the rollout of this amazing planewith that id be glad to take some of your questions jonathan karlq  back in january the president said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the russians now today can you still say definitively that nobody on the trump campaign not even general flynn had any contact with the russians before the electionmr spicer my understanding is that what general flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period  well we were very clear that during the transition period he did speak with the ambassador q  im talking about during the campaignmr spicer i dont have any  theres nothing that would conclude me  that anything different has changed with respect to that time periodq  and why would the president  if he was notified  days ago that flynn had misled the vice president other officials here and that he was a potential threat to blackmail by the russians why would he be kept on for almost three weeksmr spicer well thats not  that assumes a lot of things that are not true the president was informed of this he asked the white house counsel to review the situation the first matter was whether there was a legal issue we had to review whether there was a legal issue which the white house counsel concluded there was not as i stated in my comments this was an act of trust whether or not he actually misled the vice president was the issue and that was ultimately what led to the president asking for and accepting the resignation of general flynn thats it pure and simple it was a matter of trust we went through a very deliberative process a very thorough review the first part of it was clearly to understand the legal aspect of this and that was simply concluded there was no legal aspect and then what happened is the president evaluated the trust aspect of itmajorq  when the president was asked on air force one yesterday  i mean on friday rather traveling down to maralago about reports about conversations with the russians about sanctions he said i dont know about it ill look into that was he being truthful mr spicer what he was asked specifically is was he aware of a washington post story he hadnt seen that at the time of course he was involved i just said that he was aware of the situation right after the white house counsel informed him back in januaryq  and his inquiry to the white house counsel was strictly about the legalities involved not the propriety of the conversations between general flynn and the russian ambassador mr spicer well initially just to be q  do you have any criticism of the merits of those conversations about sanctions before the trump administration had been inauguratedmr spicer so just to be clear the acting attorney general informed the white house counsel that they wanted to give a heads up to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he had sent the vice president out in particular the white house counsel informed the president immediately the president asked him to conduct a review of whether there was a legal situation there that was immediately determined that there wasnt that was what the president believed at the time from what he had been told and he was proved to be correctthe issue pure and simple came down to a matter of trust and the president concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security advisor over q  but was it proper for the incoming national security advisor not part of an administration to be discussing an issue as sensitive as sanctions with the russian ambassadormr spicer his job is to discuss issues with his counterparts i mean charles krauthammer put it perfectly last night  thats what hes supposed to be doing i mean thats his job we would constantly read out throughout the transition who he was speaking to how he was getting ready the president was receiving congratulatory calls from around the world we would read out the world leader calls the job of the incoming nsa is to sit down with the counterparts and start that dialogue and thats exactly what he did so the question wasnt did he do anything improper or legal its a question of could he be trusted further and that trust or the erosion of that trust was frankly the issueq  did the president instruct him to talk about sanctions with the russian ambassadormr spicer no absolutely not no no no but that  no and theres no  thats never q  so would he have preferred he had not done thatmr spicer look i think the president had no problem with the fact that he acted in accord with what his job was supposed to be doing he had an ability to talk about issues that were important whether it was that or the  other countries that he spoke to that was part of his job as has been noted by many people thats what the national security advisor and frankly other positions do  they begin the process of preparing their incoming job by talking to counterparts people who have previously held the job et cetera if he had not done that there would be questions as to whether hes properly prepared on day one q  so he inaudible one conversation about sanctionsmr spicer no the issue isnt whether or not  what he discussed theres been a complete legal review of that and theres no issue with that the issue is whether or not he failed to properly inform the vice president  or not be honest with him or not remember itbut thats the plain and simple issue and when he lost trust with the president thats when the president asked for and received his resignationq  thanks a lot sean yesterday kellyanne conway counselor to the president said that the president continued to have trust in general flynn mr spicer rightq  what happened between yesterday morning and yesterday evening that led the president to lose confidence in general flynnmr spicer well im not going to get into the specifics of what the presidents thinking was but i will just say as i noted in the opening statement that it was an evolving and eroding process and so at the end of the day the president made a decision as he does on all subjects and asked for and received the national security advisors  but he is one of those people that weve noted before  when he is ready to make a decision he makes it whether its hiring somebody or asking for someones resignation once he has determined that hes made a decision on any subject thats when he informs his staffso going into the day it was an evolving situation he made a determination late in the day and he executed on ityes alexisq  hes an extremely loyal person general flynn was it a difficult decision for the president to let general flynn gomr spicer well sure i mean general flynn is a dedicated public servant hes headed the dia he has been an outstanding member of the army both as an officer and then as a flag officer hes served this country admirably and i think the president appreciated his service to his nation his commitment to his campaign and his service to this country so farbut at some point the decision came down on whether or not that that trust had eroded the important matters as i mentioned that are before the president when hes dealing with issues of world matters of all of the issues  friends and allies foes hot spots  he needs to rely on a national security advisor to give him sage advice and i think at a certain point that guidance that trust eroded and the president as he does on all matters ultimately decides that when hes ready to make a decision he executesalexisq  sean two questions does the president believe that anything that he discussed with general flynn during the transition might have been construed by the general as a request or an encouragement to discuss sanctions with the russian ambassador thats question number onemr spicer so  oh were going to pause so on the first again as i made clear theres nothing that the general did that was a violation of any sort he was well within his duties to discuss issues of common concern between the two countries i will say it again what this came down to is a matter of trust the president was glad that he was out there conducting his job preparing for his job going back and forth with his counterparts throughout the world much as the president had done with all of these world leaders calling the president congratulating him looking to set up calls for him once he was inaugurated similarly general flynn was beginning that process with his counterparts throughout the world that was never of a concern to the president from day one that he was briefed from the white house counsel the issue plain and simple came down to a matter of trust and once that occurred it was overq  on question number one just to clarify the president does not believe that any discussion that might have taken place  and we know from intel it did on sanctions  creates a problem for the president in any way  that that is not a problem that general flynn discussed sanctions with the russiansmr spicer no there is  i cant say it clearly enough there was nothing in what general flynn did in terms of conducting himself that was an issue what it came down to plain and simple was him misleading the vice president and others and not having a firm grasp on his recollection of that thats itq  question number two lawmakers on capitol hill from both sides of the aisle would like to investigate or probe or ask more questions about this does the president hope to cooperate with those investigations would he instruct members of his staff who worked for him here and in the administration to cooperate with those investigationsmr spicer well were going to comply with the law i think the president feels very confident the review that was conducted by white house counsel was very thorough and concluded very conclusively as he had first come to  instinctively come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong so people are free to do what they wish but i think that they will find exactly what the president first believed and what the white house counsel concluded and frankly i believe a couple publications even reported that there was no investigation for a reason  because there was not an issue of law it was an issue of trustgeorgeq  when do you expect to have a replacement in place and secondly on another topic there was a report yesterday that one of your colleagues said the white house is keeping dossiers on reporters can you say if thats true or notmr spicer that is absolutely not true there are no dossiers being kept its just a binder that i put right here thats about it that was a joke hold on one second and then im sorry george the first partq  timetable on a replacementmr spicer just like the way he handled this situation the president will meet with individuals and when hes ready to make a decision and he feels as though the person is qualified and can properly advise him on the issue hell make that decision but that as all decisions rests with himim just going to go to my first skype seat john huck of wkvvu out of las vegasjohnq  thank you so much on behalf of our viewers here in southern nevada for the opportunity to join you today as you know sean las vegas has suffered terribly in the last recession  more so than perhaps any other city in the country as the administration moves forward with repealing financial regulations and possibly rolling back doddfrank what guarantees can you make to nevadans that those actions wont lead banks and investments banks to reengage with the risky financial behaviors that tanked our economy the last time and left taxpayers here on the hook to bail those banks outmr spicer thanks john i think one of the things  if you look at the intent of doddfrank it was to make sure that we didnt have institutions that were too big to fail and frankly it has actually created institutions that are now too big to fail doddfrank actually did exactly the opposite of what it intended to do and i think when you look at the regulation hjr  that the president is signing today this is another example of the president taking decisive action to roll back regulations that are frankly creating more of a burden on our nations banks and businesses than helping themi think the president is going to be very clear with making sure that we do things that build up the goal of what doddfrank actually intended to do but right now we actually through doddfrank put taxpayers more on the hook than we let them off weve created more institutions and created more guarantees for the federal government to bail out some of these institutions if they exceed their authorityjohn robertsq  let me go back to what you said at the beginning you said the white house counsels office reviewed this and determined that there was nothing illegal what evidence did they look at in making this determination and secondly democrats up on the hill say that they want an investigation of this theyre looking into what did the president know and when did he know it so can you tell us what evidence you looked at the white house counsels office and what did the president know about all of this and when was he aware of itmr spicer well as i mentioned the first day that the department of justice made white house counsel available  or sought to notify white house counsel was january th the president was immediately informed of the situation as i said based on the information that was provided at the time the view was that this was not a violation he was proved instinctively correct and white house counsel at that time undertook an extensive review both of materials and questioning q  did they mr spicer im not going to get into the specifics what i will tell you is on multiple occasions they had an exhaustive and extensive questioning of general flynn on several occasions based on information that was provided to them or materials that were provided to them to review im not going to get into the details of that but i will just say that there was an exhaustive review and again the thing thats important to note is the vice president and myself  in fact i think the first time i brought this issue up was january   the department of justice didnt notify the white house or the white house counsel at that time in the transition phase until  days later so i think its important to understand something very very important this idea of why did it take so long  i think the first question should be where was the department of justice in this they were aware of this we were making statements based on what general flynn was telling us starting on january th the vice president went out on the th right they didnt notify the white house counsels office until january th at that time there was an immediate  the president was immediately informed of that and then asked the white house counsel to conduct a very very thorough review the first part of that review was focused on whether or not there was any legal issue  thats it once that became the issue then there was a  it shifted into phase two which is whether or not there was trust still maintained then that became a separate set of issues that were q  i understand im speaking to the actual evidence that the fbi has transcripts of these intercepts which i assume were done by the nsa via a fisa court order was there any communication between the white house counsels office and the fbi did those transcripts ever enter mr spicer i will say that obviously  there was obviously communication between the department of justice and the white house counsels office im not going to get into the specific nature of that i think it would be inappropriate because of the nature of the information that was being discussedyesq  why not dismiss the general on january th why if the question was of trust and immediately you have on the th hes on face the nation saying that  the vice president on face the nation saying that this is what general flynn told me and then january th you hear the opposite  why not immediately act why wait another two and a half weeksmr spicer i dont understand how thats a due process because what the  the attorney general didnt come  the acting attorney general  come in and say that there was an issue she said we wanted to give you a heads up that there may be information okay she could not confirm there was an investigation and so it would be unbelievably shortsighted and wrong to go in and dismiss someone immediately in fact what the president did was take decisive action to make sure that the white house counsel thoroughly reviewed and vetted the situation he took immediate decisive action and if you look at the timeline in terms of what he did and how that expanded the white house counsels first and foremost goal was to make sure that there was not a legal issue at hand once that was concluded then it became a phase of determining whether or not the generals action on this and a whole host of other issues undermined his trust in the president but the president from day one from minute one was unbelievably decisive in asking for and demanding that his white house counsel and their team review the situation first and foremost to question whether its a legal issue and what they immediately determined  not immediately but within several days was that after review that there was not a legal issue and then it moved into a second phasemaraq  so wait  because the president tweeted this morning that the real story is leaks  illegal leaksmr spicer it is leaks but if you think about this  understand that all of this information was leaked i mean i got to  and again i know weve got me lecturing you about what the story should be but i think that theres a real story here the idea that not just in this administration but the obama administration going back to the bush administration and back that we have an issue where classified information of which this would be is handled in such a way that it is being given out and i know in some cases its a good story and i understand that and thats to some degree your responsibility to write that but i think theres also a story here with the amount of leaks that are coming out of people that are entrusted with national security secrets and classified information are leaking it out thats a real concern for this president that when hes talking on the phone with a world leader that when hes making key decisions that are in the interest of protecting this country that we have to wonder whether or not people who work for our government who are entrusted with classified information and decisionbased materials are leaking that information out that i do believe is a big story that should be reported i also believe that the president is rightly so very very concerned about this because its not just something that is plaguing the current situation but it goes back through the obama administration the bush administration the clinton administration when we have government employees that are entrusted with this and then leak it out that undermines our national security franklytreyq  hold on mr spicer sorry i apologize maraq  i know you just forgot i have a question but i want you to clarify something you just said to john are you saying that no one has read the transcripts of the calls or you just dont want to tell us whether they mr spicer i said that im not going to comment on itq  okay so my question is about sanctions you were very specific in talking about the sanctions against crimea and that he doesnt want to lift them until crimea is returned but the sanctions that flynn was discussing were the sanctions for the election hackingmr spicer rightq  thats something the president could remove on his own if he wanted to is he committed to keeping thosemr spicer i think secretary mnuchin commented on that theres no change in our current sanctions strategy with russia and ive got nothing for you on thattreyq  given that the current story is leaks what is the president willing to do to investigate further to determine where these leaks are coming frommr spicer yeah again i think this goes back to the same way he negotiates telling people what were going to do to cover up additional leaks wouldnt be a very sound strategy when it comes to making sure that that doesnt happen again the president has been very clear whether hes negotiating or dealing with an issue like this you dont telegraph to people how youre going to handle itq  sean mr spicer hold on trey gets a followup everyone else got oneq  so he is going to take some sort of steps to investigate these leaks that the administration mr spicer i would just say that the president as i said is clearly upset about this he understands the threat that they pose to our national security and hes going to make sure that he continues to take action to make sure that that stopsyesq  thank you so youve mentioned time and time again that this is an issue of trust you also said that it was an evolving issue and that the issue of the trust that the president had for flynn came down to this deception that happened with the vice president but also a host of whole other  of other issues what were the other issues and was the vice president the only person that was misled by flynn were other people misledmr spicer i mean i think ive stood before you before and explained what general flynn had conveyed to me i think there were some others that he had similarly expressed that to as well so thats why its others because it wasnt just people who went out and made public pronouncements and a series of questioning that was rather exhaustive over a long period of time he continued to maintain that that had not occurred and i think thats where the president continued to  and thats why the president was very clear that it was an eroding issue because it was after a series of issues and a series of statements and pronouncements that the president came to that conclusionq  were there other issues outside of this call and the deception over that that led to the mistrust with flynnmr spicer i think the statement is very clear that it was this and a series of issues with that let me go to jason stevens of the federalist paper in ashland ohioq  thank you what our readers at the federalist papers project are most interested in is returning the country to the first principles of republican government as understood by the american founders one of those principles in the declaration of independence is the consent of the governed so my question is this what are the presidents future plans for rolling back the expensive and burdensome regulations of the administrative state most of which are the product of unelected unaccountable bureaucrats who never received the consent of the governed to do anything let alone make lawmr spicer thanks jason i think as i mentioned today the president in just a few minutes is going to be signing hjr  which is one of those attempts to roll back some onerous doddfrank regulations with respect to the sec in particular he is going to continue  last week we rolled out another one of those executive orders that ensures that for every new regulation two must be gotten rid of the presidents commitment to rolling back regulation and the overreach of government i think is unwavering and unquestionable so youre going to continue to see this president undo a lot of that government overreachjimq  yeah just a quick question you said earlier in your comments that the president has been incredibly tough on russia how is that possible he has made comment after comment over the course of the campaign the transition where he defended vladimir putin he had an interview with bill oreilly where he when he was asked if vladimir putin is a killer he said well america hasnt been that much better in this regard also to me it seems and i think to a lot of americans it seems that this president has not been tough on russia how can you say thatmr spicer because i just walked through it i think theres a difference between the president wanting to have an understanding of how a good relationship with russia can help us defeat isis and terrorism throughout the world look the obama administration tried to have a reset with russia they failed they tried to tell russia not to invade crimea they failed this president understands that its in americas national and economic interests to have a healthy relationship if he has a great relationship with putin in russia great if he doesnt then hell continue on but hes not going to just assume that because it wasnt able to happen in the past  i think youve seen with prime minister abe in particular and others that the reset that prime minister netanyahu talked about tomorrow  so many of these countries from around the globe are looking forward to resetting the relationships that this country has with them that they feel as though they were abandoned over the last eight years and that they are excited about the prospect of a new us relationship under a trump administrationbut with respect to russia i think the comments that ambassador haley made at the un were extremely forceful and very clear that until q  that was an announcement from haley not the presidentmr spicer she speaks for the president i speak for the president all of us in this administration and so all of the actions and all of the words in this administration are on behalf and at the direction of this president so i dont think we could be any clearer on the presidents commitmentkatie pavlichq  quick little followup because i havent had any followups or questions in a while but anyway mr spicer reallyq  no  the other question is just getting back to what was asked a few moments ago about trust and being misled are you saying that the national security advisor was intentionally misleading the president the vice president yourself when he made these comments to you about that conversationmr spicer no look the trust is given by the president its a relationship between he and any individual and so as i mentioned in the comments maybe it was because  i dont know that it was intentional he may have just forgotten but i think at some point trust isnt just q  isnt that kind of a weird thing to forget though in a conversation where you talk about mr spicer but thats the point jim is that at some point that trust eroded to a point where the president did not feel comfortable with him serving in that position and asked for and received his resignationkatie pavlichq  sean on the trust issue and the eroding of trust last night in general flynns resignation letter he said he inadvertently briefed the vice presidentelect and others with incomplete informationmr spicer rightq  considering his role in advising the president on national security matters is the white house concerned that he maybe briefed the presidentelect vice presidentelect with incomplete information on other matters of national security in addition to his phone calls with the russian ambassadormr spicer well when you look at the team its not one person in isolation katie its several youve got general kelly on the homeland security front general mattis on the dod front  hes got an entire national security staff and apparatus that briefs him  you know director pompeo at the cia and others from the dnis office that come in and brief him on a whole host of issues so its not a single positionq  so was his situation an isolated incident of giving incomplete mr spicer well yeah regardless of whether its a single situation its not as though theres one person briefing him and the president synthesizes a lot of information both written and stuff that is briefed to him and ultimately it is he who makes that decision based a lot on what he already knows what he is presented with so the president gets information from a lot of people  generals admirals people in the military community ambassadors people in the state department an exhaustive team at the national security council and then makes an ultimate decision based on that and what he already knows to be the caseq  sean youve been asked a couple times about these transcripts of calls will the white house declassify those and release themmr spicer looks it is inappropriate for me to comment on those at this time right now the focus is on some of the evolving issues that were going around the globe as you knowq  will you be open to itmr spicer let me answer the question it is not an issue that has come up i think the president right now is focused on replacing his national security advisor making sure that hes presented with the best possible information to make these key decisionsbut at this time we also have got to be careful that we were not involving ourselves in a matter of national security and the review as i mentioned was done and then immediately last night when the president felt as though it was time for a decision made it thats where we are in this iteration of the process if we have anything further for you we will update youi want to go to joyce kaufman of wftl talk news in palm beach floridaq  thank you so much for this opportunity im approximately six miles away from maralago right now and the president met with prime minister abe from japan at maralago this weekend and besides giving us traffic and security nightmares there were apparently conversations that took place by telephone and with the prime minister that were in a relatively insecure dining area there is already video of this surfacing will there be a scif put in place in these dining areas these public places and one last question when he meets with prime minister netanyahu tomorrow will they be discussing moving the embassy and settlementsmr spicer on the second one im not going to get ahead of the prime ministers discussion with the president well have a readout after that there will be a press conferencewith respect to the first there is a scif at maralago and just to be clear the briefing  the president was briefed in a scif ahead of dinner he went with his national security team they briefed him on the situation in north korea subsequently he had a dinner of which was attended exclusively by us and japanese delegation members at that time apparently there was a photo taken which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions about what may or may not be discussed there was simply a discussion about press logistics where to host the event and then after the dinner the president went back into the scif to get a further update from his teamso im not really sure where people jumped to conclusions there is a scif there it was utilized on two occasions that evening to convey to the president by his national security team the situation in north korea and then the president subsequently stood shoulder to shoulder with the japanese president to make sure that our commitment to their security and stand against north korea was fully made awaremargaretq  sean can you just clarify because i got a little turned around  did president trump or presidentelect trump at the time know of general flynns discussion of the sanctions while he was nscdesignate and if not when did he finally learn about them and if so why was he okay with thatmr spicer so no he was not aware as hes not backbriefed on every conversation that his national security team has or other staffers they were performing their duties as other people were in terms of getting up to speed conveying with counterparts and previous members of their team that being said when he was made aware of it once the white house counsel briefed him on concerns the department of justice had  and at that point as i mentioned what he asked and what he believed at the time and was confirmed by white house counsel was that there was no legal issue here discussing the issue didnt violate anything it was appropriate in the normal course of action to discuss that and he immediately asked the white house counsel to further confirm what his instincts were at the timethank you guys have a great one weve got everybody for a bill signing weve got a bill signingq  i didnt get my mr spicer oh hes got  margaret gets a followup but hes got q  are you  is the administration undertaking any sort of effort either cabinetwide or like inside the shop to make sure that everyone comes forward who had any communications with the russians about sanctions or otherwisemr spicer theres no other information i mean as far as we are aware that is an isolated incident that occurred and again the key point in this isnt that there were discussions there was nothing wrong or inappropriate about those discussions it purely came down to a matter of trust thats itthank you guys see you tomorrow happy valentines

2017-02-14,Remarks by President Trump at Parent-Teacher Conference Listening Session ,roosevelt room am estthe president well i am delighted to welcome everybody to the white house and betsy devos who has gone through  our new education secretary  she went through an interesting moment and youre going to do a fantastic job and i know you would have done it again if you had to do it again right laughtersecretary devos probablythe president she had no doubt that final night waiting for the vote so i just want to congratulate you you showed toughness and geniusas i said many times in my campaign we want every child in america to have the opportunity to climb the ladder to success i want every child also to have a safe community and were going to do that very much were going to be helping you a lot  a great school and some day to get a really wellpaying job or better or better own their own company and a lot of people are looking at that but it all begins with education and thats why were here this morning and im here also to celebrate a little bit with betsy because we started this journey a long time ago having to do with change and so many other good things with education and im so happy that that all worked outright now too many of our children dont have the opportunity to get that education that we all talk about millions of poor disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools and this crisis  and it really is a crisis  of education and communities working together but not working out and were going to change it around especially for the african american communities its been very very tough and unfair and i know thats a priority and its a certainly a priority of minethats why i want every single disadvantaged child in america no matter what their background or where they live to have a choice about where they go to school and its worked out so well in some communities where its been properly run and properly done and its a terrific thingcharter schools in particular have demonstrated amazing gains and results and you look at the results  we have cases in new york city that have been amazing in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of so many different schools that i can name throughout the country that i got to see during the campaign i went to one in las vegas it was the most unbelievable thing youve ever seen and theyve done a fantastic jobso there are many such schools and we want to do that on a largescale basis we can never lose sight of the connection between education and jobs im bringing a lot of jobs back were bringing a lot of big plants back into the country  everyone said it was impossible and before i even took office we started the process and tremendous numbers of plants are coming back into this country  car plants and other plants and i have meetings next week with four or five different companies big ones that are going to bring massive numbers of jobs back so were doing it from the jobs standpoint but education only makes it better our goal is a clear and very safe community great schools and we want those jobs that are highpaying jobs  weve lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries and were going to bring them back so im going to do my job and betsy at the education level will do her job and just to do it very very formally i want to congratulate you on having gone through a very tough trial and a very unfair trial and you won and theres something very nice about that and ill tell you the real winner will be the children  i guess a couple of adults inaudible  but will be the children of this country and i just want to congratulate yousecretary devos thank you mr presidentthe president perhaps well go around the room and

between neighbors are pretty complex and we wont always agree on everything but because of our deep abiding respect for one another were able to successfully navigate those complexities and still remain the closest of allies and friends make no mistake  at the end of the day canada and the us will always remain each others most essential partnerand todays conversations have served to reinforce how important that is for both canadians and americans as we know  us states list canada as their largest export market and our economies benefit from the over  billion in twoway trade that takes place every single day millions of good middleclass jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success and were going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that canadian and american families can get aheadas interpreted from french as we know  us states list canada as their largest export market and our economies benefit from the over  billion in twoway trade that takes place every single day millions of good middleclass jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success and were going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that canadian and american families can get aheadin english id like to highlight just a few of the specifics that president trump and i discussed today at the end of the day the president and i share a common goal we both want to make sure that hardworking folks can go to work at a good job put food on the table for their families and save up to take a vacation every once in a while thats what were trying to do heretoday we reiterated that our nations are committed to collaborating on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment and as we know investing in infrastructure is a great way to create the kind of economic growth that our countries so desperately need in that same vein we know that ensuring equal opportunities for women in the workforce is essential for growing the economy and maintaining american and canadian competitiveness on the world stage as such the president and i have agreed to the creation of the canadaunited states council for advancement of women entrepreneurs and business leaders this initiative is more than just about dollars and cents this is about ensuring that women have access to the same opportunities as men and prioritizing the support and empowerment of women who are senior business leaders and entrepreneurs in doing so well grow the canadian and american economies and help our businesses prosperas interpreted from french finally president trump and myself have agreed to work together to fight against the traffic of opioids across our border the rise of illegal use of opioids in our society is nothing less than a tragedy we will do everything we can to ensure the safety of canadians and americans ladies and gentlemen president trump i know that if our countries continue to work together our people will greatly benefit from this cooperation in english history has demonstrated time and again that in order to tackle our most pressing issues both foreign and domestic we must work with our closest allies learn from each other and stand in solidarity as a united voicewith a level of economic and social integration that is unmatched on the world stage canada and the united states will forever be a model example of how to be good neighbors winston churchill once said that long canadian frontier from the atlantic to the pacific oceans guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations is an example to every country and a pattern for the future of the world that my friends is the very essence of the canadaus relationshipi look forward to working with president trump over the coming years to nurture and build upon this historic partnership once again its a tremendous pleasure to be here in washington merci beaucoup president trump okay well take a couple of questions scott thuman scott q  thank you mr president you just spoke about the desire to build bridges although there are some notable and philosophical differences between yourself and prime minister trudeau im curious as you move forward on issues from trade to terrorism how do you see this relationship playing out and are there any specific areas with which during your conversations today you each decided to perhaps alter or amend your stances already on those sensitive issues like terrorism and immigrationand prime minister trudeau while only in its infancy so far how do you see this relationship compared to that under the obama administrationpresident trump well we just began discussions we are going to have a great relationship with canada maybe as good or better hopefully than ever before we have some wonderful ideas on immigration we have some i think very strong very tough ideas on the tremendous problem that we have with terrorism and i think when we put them all together which will be very very quickly  we have a group of very talented people  we will see some very very obvious results were also doing some crossborder things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster for tradewe have  through technology we have some really great ideas and theyll be implemented fairly quicklyprime minister trudeau one of the things we spoke about was the fact that security and immigration need to work very well together and certainly canada has emphasized security as we look towards improving our immigration system and remaining true to the values that we have and we had a very strong and fruitful discussion on exactly thattheres plenty that we can draw on each other from in terms of how we move forward with a very similar goal which is to create free open societies that keep our citizens safe and thats certainly something that were very much in agreement ontonda maccharlesq  good afternoon mr president and mr prime minister and mr prime minister could you answer in english and french for us pleasea little bit of a followon on my american colleagues question president trump you seem to suggest that syrian refugees are a trojan horse for potential terrorism while the prime minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms so id like to know are you confident the northern border is securepresident trump you can never be totally confident but through the incredible efforts  already i see it happening  of formerly general kelly now secretary kelly we have really done a great job were actually taking people that are criminals  very very hardened criminals in some cases with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems  and were getting them out and thats what i said i would do im just doing what i said i would do when we won by a very very large electoral college voteand i knew that was going to happen i knew this is what people were wanting and that wasnt the only reason that wasnt my only thing that we did so well on but that was something was very important and i said we will get the criminals out the drug lords the gang members were getting them outgeneral kelly who is sitting right here is doing a fantastic job and i said at the beginning we are going to get the bad ones  the really bad ones were getting them out and thats exactly what were doingi think that in the end everyone is going to be extremely happy and i will tell you right now a lot of people are very very happy right nowprime minister trudeau canada has always understood that keeping canadians safe is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any government and thats certainly something that were very much focused on at the same time we continue to pursue our policies of openness towards immigration refugees without compromising security and part of the reason we have been successful in doing that over the past year  welcoming close to  syrian refugees  is because we have been coordinating with our allies the united states and around the world to demonstrate that security comes very seriously to us and thats something that we continue to deal withas interpreted from french it is clear that if you want to have a healthy and secure society or safe society you have to make sure that you maintain  that you focus on security and we have welcomed refugees from syria we have been very successful but we have always taken our responsibility toward security very seriously and our allies including the united states understand this focus very well and they have done so since the very beginningpresident trump  caitlin collins ph pleaseq  thank you president trump now that youve been in office and received intelligence briefings for nearly one month what do you see as the most important national security matters facing us and prime minister trudeau youve made very clear that canada has an opendoor policy for syrian refugees do you believe that president trumps moratorium on immigration has merit on national security groundspresident trump okay thank you many many problems when i was campaigning i said its not a good situation now that i see it  including with our intelligence briefings  we have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are how serious they are not only internationally but when you come right hereobviously north korea is a big big problem and we will deal with that very strongly we have problems all over the middle east we have problems just about every corner of the globe no matter where you look i had a great meeting this weekend with prime minister abe of japan and got to know each other very very well  extended weekend really we were with each other for long periods of time and our staffs and representatives but on the home front we have to create borders we have to let people that can love our country in and i want to do that we want to have a big beautiful open door and we want people to come in and come in our country but we cannot let the wrong people in and i will not allow that to happen during this administration and people  citizens of our country want that and thats their attitude too i will tell you we are getting such praise for our stance and its a stance of common sense  maybe a certain toughness but its really more than toughness its a stance of common sense  and we are going to pursue it vigorously and we dont want to have our country have the kinds of problems that youre witnessing taking place not only here but all over the world we wont stand for it we wont put up with it were just not going to let it happen were going to give ourselves every bit of chance so that things go well for the united states and they will go well thank youprime minister trudeau canada and the united states have been neighbors a long time and canadians and americans have stood together worked together at home and around the world weve fought and died together in battlefields in world war i and world war ii in korea in afghanistan but there have been times where we have differed in our approaches and thats always been done firmly and respectfullythe last thing canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves my role and our responsibility is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects canadians approach and be a positive example in the worldrichard latendresse q  thank you mr prime minister ill ask my question in french first and then for you ill  again in english as interpreted from french mr prime minister if i heard you correctly you said that canadian businesses canadian workers are concerned for their businesses and for their work and jobs concerning the renegotiation of nafta so what guarantees did you get from this government that we will keep our jobs and our businesses in the renegotiation of naftain english mr president again during the last three months you have denounced nafta you have talked over and over about the mexican portion of the agreement very little about the canadian one my question is in two short part is is canada a fair trader and when you talk about changes to nafta concerning canada are you talking about big changes or small changes thank youprime minister trudeau as interpreted first of all richard thank you for your question it is a real concern for many canadians because we know that our economy is very dependent on our bonds our relationship with the united states goods and services do cross the border each way every single day and this means a lot of millions of jobs for canadians and good jobs for canadians so we are always focusing on these jobs but there are also good jobs millions of jobs in the united states that depend on those relationships between our two countriesso when we sit down as we did today and as our teams will be doing in the weeks and months to come we will be talking about how we can continue to create good jobs for our citizens on both sides of the border and during this exercise we continue to understand that we have to allow this free flow of goods and services and we have to be aware of the integration of our economies which is extremely positive for both our countries and this is the focus that we will have in the coming weeks and months to comein english canadians are rightly aware of the fact that much of our economy depends on good working relationships with the united states a good integration with the american economy and the fact is millions of good jobs on both sides of the border depend on the smooth and easy flow of goods and services and people back and forth across our border and both president trump and i got elected on commitments to support the middle class to work hard for people who need a real shot at success and we know that by working together by ensuring the continued effective integration of our two economies we are going to be creating greater opportunities for middleclass canadians and americans now and well into the futurepresident trump i agree with that  percent we have a very outstanding trade relationship with canada well be tweaking it well be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries its a much less severe situation than whats taking place on the southern border on the southern border for many many years the transaction was not fair to the united states it was an extremely unfair transaction were going to work with mexico were going to make it a fair deal for both parties i think that were going to get along very well with mexico they understand and we understandyou probably have noticed that ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country you saw intel the other day announce that because of what ive been doing and what im doing in terms of regulation  lowering taxes et cetera  theyre coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment and thousands of thousands of jobs general motors likewise is expanding plants and going to build new plants fiat chrysler was at a meeting where theyre doing the same jack ma  we have so many people that want to come into the united states its actually very exciting i think its going to be a very exciting period of time for the united states and for the workers of the united states because they have been truly the forgotten man and forgotten women its not going to be forgotten anymore believe meso our relationship with canada is outstanding and were going to work together to make it even better and as far as the southern border is concerned were going to get that worked out were going to make it fair but we are going to make it so that everybody is happy its very important to me thank you thank you very much thank you ladies and gentlemen thank you very much applause end pm est ,20412.160156,92.25,0.0045193648930333214,5763.959961,18.609863000000587,0.0032286593116396195,2328.25,9.330077999999958,0.004007335122946401

women executives who were phenomenal  phenomenal  and really helped me a great deal in business so it was really fantastic they play a tremendously important role women in our economy women are the primary source of income in  percent of american households and households with children under the age of  in order to create economic growth and lots of very good wellpaying jobs we must ensure that our economy is a place where women can work and thrive and i think thats happening in the united states much more so and ivanka is very much involved in this and i appreciate you being involved in it and i know justin in canada its happening big league and its very important we need policies that help to keep women in the workforce and to address the unique barriers faced by female entrepreneurs  and they are unique we need to make it easier for women to manage the demands of having both a job and a family and we also need to make it easier for women entrepreneurs to get access to capital and i guess pretty much all entrepreneurs we have to help them out because the system is not working so well for entrepreneurs getting capital but its in particular difficult for women so were going to get access to markets and access to networks and i look forward to hearing your advice were going to go around the table and i want to really learn something today and again its a great honor to be with you and justin i can say on behalf of our country its an honor to be with youprime minister trudeau thank you donald for welcoming us and im really excited about launching this sitting around the table here with a number of successful executives who just happen to be women one of the things that ive been lucky enough to do over the past year in new york and beijing and across canada is sit down with women ceos women executives to talk about both their successes and the challenges theyre facing that are particular but also how of course we create more paths to success for women across our community and across our societywhenever i sit down with a woman executive i know that she has had to overcome significant barriers that exist and therefore is likely to have greater insight into how to help reduce those barriers for others but also be a formidable contributor to the success of business and her economyso i think for me its not just about doing the right thing its about understanding that women in leadership positions is a very powerful leverage for success for business for communities and for our entire economy speaks in frenchits a great pleasure to sit with you now and to hear from your extraordinary leadership president trump thank you mr prime minister so how about we start with ivanka we go around the room ivanka you might just want to say a couple of

for over  years men and women from across our country have come to these grounds driven here by that call to serve that call to leadership  of duty honor countrythey came here separately in different

to give you the tools the equipment the resources the training and the supplies you need to get the job done and he promised to honor our sacred bond to those who serve these are the presidents promises to all of you and make no mistake about it those promises will be kept in this administration applause thats really why im here tonight on the presidents behalf honoring those who serve our country requires recognizing the men and women who achieve extraordinary things in the line of dutytheres a passage in the old book i try and open it up and read it every morning it says if you owe debts pay debts if honor then honor if respect then respect and tonight marks the th annual lieutenant henry o flipper dinner which is all about doing just that it commemorates a man who we just heard overcame extraordinary adversity  demonstrated leadership selfdiscipline and courage in service to this countrythe year  only twelve years before the horrible evil of slavery that great stain on our experiment in selfgovernment had finally been eradicated in the fires of the civil war and out of those ashes emerged hope  hope that americas founding promise of equality and freedom would finally be made real for all americansit was in this hope that spurred henry flipper to write his congressman james freeman to request an appointment to the finest military academy in the world henrys skill with the written word impressed freeman we are told who determined that he was indeed worthyso came henry flipper to where we stand today all who attend west point face many trials but henry flipper faced many more that we all understand by virtue of his willingness to challenge the status quo challenge the injustices of his dayhe persevered through four years making history as the first african american ever to graduate from the united states military academy but as we just heard his struggles would continue he was ejected from the army only four years later after being accused of a crime he did not commitafter henry passed away a band of patriotic americans took up his cause and thanks to their efforts the army righted this wrong by retroactively awarding henry flipper an honorable discharge in  and you heard that president clinton pardoned him in the years that followedthe following year after he was honorably discharged his alma mater began to celebrate his accomplishments with the first installment of the dinner we have here tonight fittingly im told the first henry o flipper dinner was held  years after his groundbreaking graduation from west point altogether fittingbut the purpose of tonight im told is not just to remember henry flipper and his extraordinary courage and accomplishment but its held every year in the midst of african american history montha week ago today president trump signed a proclamation honoring this occasion and declaring that the history of african americans exemplifies the resilience and the spirit that continue to make our nation greatwe need only look at henry flippers life to see this truth in this statement but we should also look back to the generations of african americans who have defended and died for this country as far back as the very hour of our nations birthwhen i think of these brave men and women i cant help but think of that famous painting its known as washingtons crossing it depicts george washington and his band crossing the delaware if you look closely if you havent looked at that painting and its one of my favorites youll see someone who is sometimes overlooked next to general washington himself immediately to his left is a young african american soliderthe symbolism is profound the painting was rendered by a german abolitionist who was determined to recognize the countless african americans who fought side by side with our founders in the pursuit of a free america  of liberty and equality for allmen like crispus attucks who perished in the boston massacre or lemuel hayes who fought at lexington and concord or the dozens who enlisted in the first rhode island regiment just to name a fewin new england some african american patriots rose as high as the rank of colonel yet no matter their rank they were all of them every bit as freedomloving and dedicated to independence as george washington himselftonight i think of them  but of course not only them i think of the nearly  african americans who fought for the union in the civil war and for the new birth of freedom that followed iti think of the buffalo soldiers we learned tonight that henry flipper was among them who actually helped tame the west i think of the tuskegee airmen who flew for freedom in world war two  men like general benjamin o davis jr whose strength of character carried him through four difficult years at west point and who is now honored for his resolve with a barracks that bears his name i think of all these heroes in this month and many more i havent mentioned because they are the best of usand during this month african american history month but not only this month we remember them and we thank them for what they did their names and their sacrifices will never be forgotten for they understood the promise of america  the timeless ideals that bind us together as a people and give us purpose as a nationthats why we are here tonight we know in our hearts that america is extraordinary and that our sacred birthright must be defended no matter the cost this gift has always inspired our fellow americans to step up and serve and i believe it always willit certainly inspired henry flipper and all those that we reflect on tonight he persevered not just through four years at west point but over injustice itself we remember and honor him tonight for his unyielding tenacity in the face of hardshiphenrys life always be a model for those who find towering barriers standing before them waiting to be overcome for  years now the united states corps of cadets has chosen one of its own who has embodied henrys courage his leadership his determination to let no obstacle stand in his way and tonight that honor falls to cadet lars lofgren applause cadet lofgren personifies the legacy of henry flipper and all the other previous recipients of the flipper award as all of you know two years ago cadet lofgren was tragically injured during a training exercise at fort campbell kentucky since that day he has been paralyzed from the waist down but he didnt let it stop him less than  months later he participated  i had to read this twice  he participated in the  warrior games where he won an astounding seven medals applausenot only that he then returned to west point to complete his final year  such is his love for america for this great institution and his sense of dutycadet lofgren you are an inspiration to us all you are truly a worthy recipient of the henry flipper award and im honored to be here tonight to be a part of watching you receive it and tonight you will receive it from none other than one of henrys descendants ken davis and we thank him so much for being with us todayi know everyone joins me in congratulating cadet lofgren and the honor he gives us by being here tonightthe legacy of henry flipper lives on in many others including two distinguished guests we have with us tonightpat locke who retired from the army as a major is here with us this evening shes a trailblazer cut from the same cloth as henry flipper himself in  she departed from these grounds  stand up and take a bow would you please applause thank you major in  she departed from these grounds as the firstever female african american graduate of west pointwe also have with us cadet christian nattiel he is the first african american from west point to receive the prestigious rhodes scholarship and will soon head to oxford to teach them a thing or two applauseall those whom i have recognized are heirs of a long and proud tradition that stretches back into the mists of american history but they are not the only ones it is this same tradition that really brings all of us here tonight and togethernow weve not come to west point nor did our forefathers because of the color of our skin or the creed we profess we gather because of our country  a country that has given us so much and to which we are now called to give in returnone of my late fathers favorite versus was to whom much is given much will be required and i know that every one of you that has stepped forward to be a part of this incredible tradition to serve your country feels that in your heart you cadets before me have answered that call youve stepped up and soon you will go forthlast night was post night im told when the graduating seniors learned where they will be stationed you will all of you do our country proud so that future generations may yet call themselves sons and daughters of america lets give all of those who participated in post night a round of applause applause your accomplishments here at west point your leadership speaks louder than anyone could at a dinner like tonightand your service is needed now more than ever beyond our nations borders lies a world riven by conflict and oftentimes wracked by chaos evil abounds across the globe old enemies have reared their ugly heads once more and new ones have arisen toothe forces of radical islam terrorism seek to destroy not only our people but our very way of life the barbarians known as isis are brutally killing anyone who stands in the way of their attempts to establish a global caliphate they will not stop until we stop them and we will stop them applausethe threats facing america have never been more numerous it seems sometimes more sophisticated more zealous in their adherence to failed ideas that belong in the ashheap of history but make no mistake about it president trump and this administration and this country will not rest until these enemies are destroyed and our nation is safe again applauseand i promise you  i promise you those of you that are preparing to enter the service of the united states of america on your graduation of west point we will not relent in our effort until we have rebuilt the arsenal of democracy and ensured that our soldiers sailors airmen marines and coast guard have the resources and the training they need to

that the general just shared with me we took a stroll didnt we general down a block to see that macarthur statue and i polished his boot laughter before i left the oval office this afternoon the president told me you have to go down to the macarthur statue we didand i read those words that were i think first spoken in this very room and theyre words that really represent the foundation of the past present and the future of this extraordinary institution and the tradition that youve embraced  duty honor countrymacarthur said those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be what you can be and what you will be they are your rallying points to build courage when courage seems to fail to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith to create hope when hope becomes forlornstirring words on a cold night they warmed my heart because i knew id be looking out on a roomful of men and women who were living out that every single dayyou know to serve with president trump is to serve with someone who has boundless confidence in the american people and boundless optimism about americas future and its an honor to be with you tonightbut let me say what the

of individuals is really important to usthe president well you know the vetting is much much tougher now and we need this court case it will be very helpful to keeping the wrong people out of our country you understand that better than anybody so i think were going to have some good resultssheriff stanek i do sirthe president it may take a little while and you know this is a very dangerous period of time because while everybody is talking and dealing a lot of bad people are thinking about hey lets go in right now but were being very very tough with the vetting  tougher than ever beforesheriff stanek sir i chaired the homeland security committee for the national sheriffs association we heard from general kelly yesterday his message was right on the mark about carrying out your directives and we appreciate thatthe president that used to be a political position you know what general kelly is doing here right now homeland security if you remember  its like a political position not anymore now its in my opinion one of truly most important positions so hes doing a great job thank you very muchsheriff stanek thank you sirthe president yes sirsheriff glick mr president thank you its such an honor to be here im danny glick sheriff of laramie county wyoming you know there are so many issues that youll hear going around this table one of the ones that probably isnt  that people dont realize is epa decisions that have affected our coal industry our oil industry in the west but beyond that it increases the number of people that are jobless and thus increases our crime statistics and its starting to overwhelm us were very small out there for the most part and we dont have the numbers of deputies officers and law enforcement that can sometimes keep up with this i appreciate what youve done and what youre planning in the future i think it was very well publicized and i just appreciate being here todaythe president thank you sheriff and i will tell you that the epa  youre right i call it  its clogged the bloodstream of our country people cant do anything people are looking to get approvals for factories for  years and then after the th year they get voted down after having spent a fortune so thats going to end we have one of our really great people  as you know scott is looking to be approved by the senate were still waiting for that one too its a disgrace whats going on but as soon as he gets involved were going to unclog the systemand by the way people are going to get rejected but theyre going to get rejected quickly but for the most part theyre going to be accepted when they want to do were going to bring the jobs back and your state was very very good to me as you know i mean they were very very good to me and i appreciate that and just tell the people were going to get the system unclogged and were going to get it up as you know i approved two pipelines that were stuck in limbo forever i dont even think it was controversial you know i approved them  i havent even heard  i havent had one call from anybody saying oh that was a terrible thing you did i havent had one call you know usually if i do something its like bedlam right i havent had one call from anybody and a lot of jobs  in the keystone case we have potentially  jobs almost immediately and then as you know i did the dakota pipeline and nobody called up to complain because it was unfair years of getting approvals nobody showed up to fight it this company spends a tremendous  hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars and then all of a sudden people show up to fight it its not fair to our companies and i think everyone is going to be happy in the end okayso i appreciate it very much sheriff its a great honor to have you here thank you and say hello to your peopleyes sirsheriff layton good morning mr president im john layton im the sheriff of marion county indiana which is  laughter the president you never met our great vice president laughtersheriff layton im very proud of this man and we as sheriffs  this is to me it seems like its unprecedented i look back into the history of the nsa long before myself and i never have  i could never find where  not only did the president and now the vice president as well has invited us into your house to share some concerns of ours the president and in about  minutes youre going to see the oval office too which is  thats the other thing you know people have had meetings here i had the car companies the biggest companies  ford general motors fiat  and they were in this room often and i said oh so youve seen the oval office no weve never been invited to see the oval office you know where the oval office is ten feet in that direction   feetsheriff layton looking forward to it laughterthe president look these are the biggest people that were going there  these are the biggest people so they were never invited to the oval office and they were only  feet away you would think they would be invited but youre going to see the oval office okaysheriff layton thank you mr president one of the main concerns was not just my office as sheriff but across the nation  the mentally ill in the jails and the people that theyre being really for lack of a better term warehoused in our jails across america because we dont have the facilities necessary to take care of them on the outside and it ends up a lot of these people go to jail because the public or the police officer happens to be mad at them at the time instead of they need to be in the jail for a very good reason so we just appreciate you having the back of law enforcement we do all feel that as everyone with a badge knows that you do have our backs and that were looking forward to years of harmony and taking care of business with the people we servethe president well i appreciate it and i will say that in the recent election law enforcement is with me i mean the numbers were staggering  staggering it wasnt like gee its  believe me it was through the roof law enforcement and military alsosheriff layton absolutelythe president i think generally people in uniform tend to like me laughter explain that to me dana explain that to me laughter so sheriff thank you very much and do you miss your former governorsheriff layton we do we dothe president you have a good new governorsheriff layton holcomb is holding down the fort for us

the breach and have done such a good job and lets see what happens with the court casemr boente well mr president thank you for the privilege to serve you and the department of justice and the american people im very honored by it and i want to thank all the sheriffs here but i guess our local and state partners  its very important to federal law enforcement and all the agencies and i know that senator sessions  were looking forward to him getting to the department  will make that an important priority and he wants to strengthen that bond that we have with them because its very very important to law enforcementthe president yes well thank you very much and you know one of the things that you know better than anybody is that we had a very good victory in boston so i said to everybody why dont we use the boston case why arent we using the boston case because the boston victory was great but its statutorily mr boente judge gordon who wrote that decision had a very good analysis where he referred to immigration law and i thought it was a terrific opinion and i think its the right opinion the president and a highly respected judge too so i appreciate it thank you dana

fantastic because everybody has said the same thing thank you thats very nicesheriff page thank you sirsheriff mahoney good morning mr president dave mahoney im the sheriff in dane county which is madison wisconsin i want to thank you for inviting our nations sheriffs into the white house you know as the only elected law enforcement leaders in our community we are the most engaged in our communitys issues and concerns and i think its important i think theres a strong message when the president of the united states invites our nations sheriffs in to talk about those issues that are of importance in our communitythe president has this ever happened before with the sheriffsparticipant no sirparticipant no sir  the president it never happenedparticipant never the president and yet the murder rate in our country is the highest its been in  years right did you know that fortyseven years i used to use that  id say that in a speech and everybody was surprised because the press doesnt tell it like it is it wasnt to their advantage to say that but the murder rate is the highest its been in i guess from  to  years and you would think that you would be invited here and you would think that you people would be able to solve  had you  if you ran chicago you would solve that nightmare i tell you ill bet everybody in that room especially carolyn right would raise their hand because to allow  i mean literally  hundreds of shootings a month its worse than some of the places that we read about in the middle east where you have wars going on its so sad chicago has become so sad a situationsheriff mahoney im only three hours from downtown chicago and as sheriff stanek mentioned the issues of heroin and opiate addiction  im averaging   overdoses a week in my community and we need help from dea fbi and our task forces we need them to be adequately funded and led by leaders who want to work collectively with our nations sheriffsthe president how much of your crime is caused do you think by drugs generallysheriff mahoney eighty percent the president eighty percent so without drugs you would have a whole different ballgame sheriff mahoney i have a jail over  beds eighty percent suffer from chronic drug and alcohol addictionthe president and when did it start big league or has it been going on for many yearssheriff mahoney well i think heroin and opiates have overshadowed cocaine which of course has been since the eighties our numberone drug of choice now its prescription painkillers and the president and at a much higher levelsheriff mahoney at a higher level the president much highersheriff mahoney the overdoses are at a much higher levelthe president right rightparticipant mr president i hate to interrupt  it used to take  days to take a load of heroin from the border to get it into the inaudible mainstream now its taking  days the president okay well well have it take infinity okay laughter sheriff mahoney i want to thank you too for seeking the input and guidance of our nations sheriffs on issues like immigration my community is looking for immigration reform an expedited way for a good immigrant to obtain citizenship in this great country and i appreciate the invitation today to join you and look forward to working with you on many of these issues some well disagree on but far more were going to agree onthe president absolutely youre right i actually cant believe that were having to fight to protect the security  in a court system to protect the security of our nation i cant even believe it and a lot of people agree with us believe me theres a group of people out there  and i mean much more than half of our country  much much more youre not allowed to use the term silent majority anymore youre not allowed because they make that into a whole big deal but theres a group of people out there  massive massive numbers far bigger than what you see protesting and if those people ever protested you would see a real protest but they want to see our borders secure and our country secure and they want to see people that can love our country come in not people that are looking to destroy our countryso anyway thank you sheriffsheriff aubrey sheriff john aubrey fifthterm sheriff jefferson county kentucky past president of national sheriffs association and my fellow sheriffs have brought up a number of points and id like to add two to it that i know are on your plate and the administrations plate the  program where we were sharing department of defense surplus material that helps us in our war they were used in the war and they helped us in our war that got severely curtailed and the other thing is asset forfeiture people want to say were taking money and without due process thats not true we take money from dope dealers the president so youre saying  okay so youre saying the assettaking you used to do and it had an impact right and youre not allowed to do it nowsheriff aubrey no they have curtailed it a little bit and im sure the folks are the president and thats for legal reasons or just political reasons sheriff aubrey they make it political and they make it  they make up stories all youve got to do the president id like to look into that okay theres no reason for that dana do you think theres any reason for that are you aware of thismr boente i am aware of that mr president and we have gotten a great deal of criticism for the asset forfeiture which as the sheriff said frequently was taking narcotics proceeds and other proceeds of crime but there has been a lot of pressure on the department to curtail some of thatthe president so what do you do so in other words they have a huge stash of drugs so in the old days you take it now were criticized if we take it so who gets it what happens to it tell them to keep itmr boente well we have what is called equitable sharing where we usually share it with the local police departments for whatever portion that they worked on the case and it was a very successful program very popular with the law enforcement community the president and now what happensmr boente well now weve just been given  theres been a lot of pressure not to forfeit in some casesthe president who would want that pressure other than like bad people right but who would want that pressure you would think theyd want this stuff taken awaysheriff aubrey you have to be careful how you speak i guess but a lot of pressure is coming out of  was coming out of congress i dont know that that will continue now or notthe president i think less so i think congress is going to get beat up really badly by the voters because theyve let this happen and i think badly i think youll be back in shape so asset forfeiture were going to go back on okaysheriff aubrey thank you sir the president i mean how simple can anything be you all agree with that i assume rightparticipant absolutely yeah the president do you even understand the other side of itparticipant no the president its like some things participant no sensethe president sort of like the iran deal nobody even understands how a thing like that could have happened it does nothingparticipant you shouldnt be allowed to profit from the illegal proceeds so if youre going to sell narcotics and sell illegal drugs in our country you also cannot profit from that and so we seize those profitsthe president so do we need any legislation or any executive orders for that would you say dana  to put that back in businessmr boente i dont think we need any executive orders we just need kind of some encouragement to move in that directionthe president okay good youre in charge laughter i love that answer because its better than signing executive orders and then these people take it and they make it look so terrible  oh its so terrible i love it youre encouraged participant thank youthe president good asset forfeiture youre encouraged okay yes sirmr bittick mr president we appreciate you having us here today at the white house my name is john cary bittick and im a sheriff in monroe county georgia and im a past president of the national sheriffs association as well and i currently chair our governmental affairs committee and i just want to thank you for the administration working actually on pieces of legislation and on political ideas with us its refreshing and we are thoroughly enjoying it we are currently working with senator grassley on some criminal justice reform issues and the administration has been supporting us and asset forfeiture is a big thingthe president okay go for it just go for it dana

vice president greg champagne i am sheriff in st charles parish louisiana basically a suburban community outside of new orleans i have the honor of representing  sheriffs around the country and you

hundred thousand deputy sheriffs who are truly the backbone of law enforcement in this country we have a bumper sticker the nsa puts out that says sheriffs and deputies the original homeland security and so that is a forcemultiplierthose men and women out there are the tip of the spear and we stand ready to help and keep this community safe because thats what were all elected to do so we thank you so much for having usthe president thank you very much youre a great group of peoplewere going to go into the oval office does anybody have anything to  not even a question a statement as to how we can bring about law enforcement in a very good civil lovely way but we have to stop crime  right would anybody like to make a statementparticipant mr president on asset forfeiture we got a state senator in texas who was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we can receive their forfeiturethe president can you believe thatparticipant and i told him that the cartel would build a monument to him in mexico if he could get that legislationthe president who is the state senator want to give his name well destroy his career laughter okay thank youparticipant mr president we have been invited to the white house before weve sat at this table with the former administration this is totally different not once did the president go around the room and ask the sheriffs what were issues that were important to us he or she in our parts of the country but rather it was an outgoing message about gun control about other things you asked us what is important to us whether its mental health in the jails opioid addiction you hit it right off the bat the border immigration vetting we appreciate that that has not happened before weve been here before but weve never had a president sit down and listen to what it is that were facing representing our constituents and public safety across this country and thats why we appreciate it thats why were here todaythe president you know bill belichick is a great guy a friend of mine and he was telling me  somebody told me that hell oftentimes wanting to get a player hell go to the other players on the team  hell

not reporting or america is not caring about this type of the president i have to know because im reported on possibly more than anybody in the world  i dont think you have anything to say about that i happen to know how dishonest the media is i happen to know stories about me that should be good  or bad  you know i dont mind a bad story if its true but i dont like bad stories that  stories that should be a positive story when they make them totally negative i understand the total dishonesty of the media better than anybody and i let people know it i mean the media is a very very dishonest

nations success depends on the education of our students and betsy devos has devoted nearly three decades of her time and talent to promoting educational opportunity as secretary she will ensure that every student has access to a good school whether its public private parochial charter or any other kindthe fact that we had to get to the point where the vice president had to be pulled in to overcome the democrats historic and partisan logjam of the presidents qualified nominee is another glaring reminder of the unprecedented obstruction that senate democrats have engaged in throughout this processthe american people sent a strong message when they elected president trump in november theyre fed up with business as usual in washington democrats in the senate should expect that voters will remember how they stood in the way of the president enacting an agenda that put him into officelast week i noted the president had a fair amount of cabinetlevel appointees awaiting a full vote by the senate were looking forward to seeing more of the presidents picks to lead agencies and departments confirmed in the upcoming week despite these childish tactics of the democrats in the senate who would rather keep the failed status quo than allowing to put the presidents people in placealso on the hill today judge gorsuch continues a full week of meetings with republican and democratic senators yesterday he met with senators tester and feinstein today he will meet with senators sasse schumer crapo and thune the president is looking forward to a full hearing for the judge followed by an up or down vote on this incredibly qualified nomineeat this moment the president is meeting with congressman jason chaffetz to discuss how to work together to enact his reform agenda later this afternoon the president will meet with secretary of state tillerson the president was obviously pleased to welcome and confirm  swear in secretary tillerson in the oval office last week and hes pleased that the secretary is now able to bring his unique skillset and deep insights to the important work of the state departmentfollowing his discussion with secretary tillerson the president will have calls with prime minister rajoy of spain and president erdogan of turkey well of course have readouts of both of those calls when theyre completedthis evening the president will host young officers from the united states army special forces qualification course in the oval office as the president said yesterday members of our military and their families are our nations heroes it is one of his top priorities to ensure that the men and women of our armed forces have the tools equipment and resources they need to execute their mission successfully the president is looking forward to conveying his gratitude and support to these young brave captainslater this evening around  th circuit court will hold oral arguments per its order from yesterday i want to quickly run down what we can expect to happen tonight a career attorney from the department of justice will present an argument in defense of the presidents order and to be clear all thats at issue tonight is the hearing  is an interim decision on whether the presidents order is enforced or not until the case is heard on the actual merits of the order its a simple status quo versus antistatus quo decisionthis is just like the case in boston which started as a temporary restraining order there once we were able to explain our position the court lifted the order and held that the presidents executive order could take effect as i have stated before  us code  gives the president constitutional authority for this executive order it says whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the united states would be detrimental to the interests of the united states he may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions which he may deem to be appropriate we look forward to a final decision on the merits of this soonlooking ahead i know a few have been asking for more details on prime minister abes visit later this week as previously announced he will visit the white house for meetings on the th of february the president has also invited him down to maralago and the two leaders will travel there for the weekend this is a testament to the importance the united states places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance and the deep economic ties between the united states and japanneedless to say the president is looking very much forward to welcoming the new england patriots to the white house to celebrate their fifth world championship it was obviously a spectacular gamelastly we have our eyes on kabul today following the tragic suicide bombing that killed at least  afghan civilians and wounded   just this morning general flynn spoke with the afghan national security advisor to reaffirm our continued support for afghanistan and for our strategic partnership we condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest possible terms and we commend the afghan security forces for their rapid response we also reaffirm our support to the afghan government as they work to defend their people against enemies of peaceand with that ill take your questions david jacksonq  sean the list of  terrorist attacks that you released it looked like it had been prepared well in advance i mean was that already on hand when president trump made his comments or did you do it afterwards and plan to release itmr spicer well i think the answer was we had been getting questions as to what the presidents remarks were we wanted to be very clear that there are a lot of examples between  and  that have occurred and many of them havent gotten the attention that they have deserved its becoming too often that were seeing these attacks not get the spectacular attention that they deserve and i think it undermines the understanding of the threat that we face around this countrythe reason the president has been acting in so many of the ways that he has with executive order and otherwise the discussions that he had down at centcom and socom yesterday are because he cares about making sure that we dont have attacks in this country that were protected that were ahead of the curve and i think what we need to do is to remind people that the earth is a very dangerous place these days that isis is trying to do us harm and that the presidents commitment is to keep this country safeand i think part of this is to make sure that the american people are reminded how prevalent some of these attacks and how much time and attention they have or have not gotten but more importantly to make sure that they understand the unwavering commitment that the president has and the actions that he will take to keep the country safeq  was the list put together after his commentsmr spicer yes yes treyq  thanks sean on the call with turkish president erdogan later today does president trump intend to discuss plans for syrian safe zones and does the president expect turkey to help create those zonesmr spicer i think well have a readout for you on that i dont want to get ahead of the two leaders callsalexis realclearpoliticsq  sean i have two questions for you you were mentioning that voters are going to remember how senators voted on the presidents cabinet nominees two republicans voted against betsy devos  senators collins and murkowski did the president reach out to either of them and will he not forget what republicans did in that particular nominee situationmr spicer i think  look the president has been very clear its not republicans that have stood in the way of this nomination of all of these qualified individuals its been democrats that have stalled over and over again not attending hearings trying to use every delay tactic possible its those people that have a problem and i think thats the message that the party has missed on the democratic side which  and i dont think that  i wouldnt paint it with a broad brush because i think its senate democrats frankly that havent gotten the messageq  but he never reached out to themmr spicer our team has been in contact with the entire senate team to make sure that they understand and that theyve had visits as requested but we have been in constant contact with the senate members of the senate their staffs our legislative affairs team has had an extremely robust schedule of meetings with their teams to make these nominees available to thembut i think the broader issue again  and with all due respect i think its interesting that were focusing on the votes of two republicans when you look at the spectrum of antics that have gone on in the democrats i mean the tactics that they have done over and over and over again to delay not show up to hearings filibuster to the extent that they can run the clock out  its not republicans that have a problem here alexis its the democrats that continue to do thisq  the second question has to do with the presidents remarks about the affordable care act in his interview on sunday  because he indicated in his response in that interview that he thought that the repealandreplace was going to take longer perhaps into  can you clarify whether he is frustrated about this what he is doing about the timing because of course voters who sent him here were anticipating that this might move faster than he was conveying in the interviewmr spicer well i think luckily  and you saw speaker ryans comments earlier today  i think we can have this done legislatively sooner rather than later but i think the implementation of a lot of the pieces may take a little bit longerits a big big bill that the democrats passed as you recall they told us we could read it after they passed it we are now going through this to make sure that we do this in a very responsible way to make sure that health care which is so vital to so many americans and their families is preserved while we put a new system in place that both lowers costs and increases accessibilitybut the president i think is very encouraged by the commitment and work thats going on on the hill to make sure that we get this thing replaced as quick as possiblefred lucasq  thanks sean i wanted to ask  actually a followup related to that speaker ryan has actually said  and im quoting  with obamacare you cant tinker at the margins and repair it you cant it is a collapsing law do you agree with that and you cant build on whats already there you have to get rid of the entire lawmr spicer i think what were focused on is the end solution and i think weve been very clear over and over again that the president is going to repeal and replace it and that what americans will get at the end of this is a health care solution that as ive said before over and over again is going to give them a lowercost health solution with more options thats what they were promised in the first place thats what we can giveand i think the president being able to approach this in the businesslike manner that hes done so successfully in the past is going to ensure that he negotiates prices that we look at those businesslike practices force competition among states and other things that will help lower cost once and for all and provide that competition q  on iran sanctions does the president have any concerns about the fact that adam szubin is the acting treasury secretary in terms of implementing those sanctionsmr spicer no we implemented them  they went off without a hitchfred  i mean john deckerq  thanks a lot sean as you know the president spoke over the weekend on twitter and criticized the federal judge appointed by george w bush who imposed the nationwide restraining order he called him a socalled judge is the president as it relates to the arguments  i know youre confident  but the arguments that will be presented this evening  is he prepared to accept an adverse ruling by the th circuit court of appealsmr spicer theres no question the president respects the judicial branch and its ruling but i think that theres no way  i just read off the us code on that i dont think theres any other way that you can interpret that that the president has the discretion to do whats necessary to keep this country safe and i think thats his concern frankly right now is that when the law is such as it is that anyone could interpret that any other way i think he feels confident just like in the ruling in boston that were going to prevail on this on the merits of the case because it is done so in a very lawful waykatherineq  will the administration take a position on the israeli legislation to retract or illegalize the thousands of west bank settlements last week obviously you said building the settlements may not be helpfulmr spicer i think that as i mentioned last week  and i dont want to get too far ahead of this  but prime minister netanyahu will be here on the th i think that will be obviously a topic of discussion right now i dont want to get ahead of thatcharlie spieringq  thanks sean just a quick question any response to the calls for impeachment by representative maxine watersmr spicer nohunter walkeri mean i would just say look i think look it is  the president is doing everything he can to move this country forward and i think whether its the democrats in the senate who are trying to stall these nominees or these little political stunts on the house side the bottom line is i think by and large you see the support that the president is receiving for his policies throughout the country and its because i think people recognize a that business as usual is over and that the presidents commitment to both keeping this country safe growing the economy and creating jobs is something that is welcomed by all americans regardless of partyi think when you see stuff like that i think it really just shows that they really missed the message that voters sent this past novemberhunter walkerq  thank you sean cnn reportedly declined to interview kellyanne conway on sunday because of the questions about her credibility is the white house willing to offer alternative representatives to networks that refuse to work with specific spokespeoplemr spicer well frankly i think that my understanding is they retracted that they walked that back or denied it however you want to put it  i dont care but i think kellyanne is a very trusted aide of the president i think for any characterization otherwise is insultingi dont think  if they choose not to work with someone thats up to them but i think were going to continue to put out key leaders of this administration including kellyanne that can articulate the presidents policies and agendakatie pavlichq  thanks sean for the question is president trump planning to ask the senate to expedite legislation allowing for the swift firing of bad va employeesmr spicer i think the presidents commitment as you heard both during the campaign and as hes talked to dr shulkin is to make sure that were providing the best care and if theres things that are an impediment to that care being offered up or reformed then he is going to make sure that we enact policies internally that make sure that people who are not doing their job not servicing veterans we can figure out how to expedite that processbut the idea that were sitting around having a discussion about personnel inhibiting the care that veterans deserve really does not bode well for the reflection that we want on this country i mean people who have served this nation  we should be bending over backwards to make sure that the benefits and the care and the services that they frankly earned is something that is given the highest priority and is something that the president remains highly committed tomiriam borgessq  hey hi the president is going to speak later today with the spanish leader mariano rajoy and i would like to know how president trump sees the relation with spain and which are the main issues they are going to discuss in their phone callmr spicer so im not going to  well have a readout after the call but i imagine that theyre going to talk about a shared commitment to defeating isis and that theyll discuss our bilateral relationship and reaffirm our commitment to the two countries i think we will have a readout on that call with spain as we will with all the countries and all the other leaders that we will talk to and we have in the past so i dont want to get too far ahead of it but i would imagine that the current relationship that we have with spain and our commitment to isis will be at the forefront of thatmaria peaq  yes here sorry thank you its kind of loud in here so its a twopart question one can you confirm whether or not the white house has accepted the credentials of the new mexican ambassador gernimo gutirrez and also representative mike rogers i believe this morning said that he plans to introduce a bill to impose a  percent tax on all remittances that mexicans send to their country to pay for the wall would the president rally behind that billmr spicer so first i would have to get back to you on the ambassadors credentials i dont know we could check with the department of state and figure that out i dont know that right off the top of my head and im not going to comment  i dont  we dont put out statements of administration policy until the bill has gone through the processhallieq  two questions for you one following up on health care the president as you know campaigned for  months on replacing the affordable care act where is his planmr spicer hes working with congress i just answered that question but hes working with speaker ryan let me  youre acting like q  the specifics of it though i mean does he owe the american people something now given mr spicer and i think hes been very clear that he owes the american people a result thats going to lower costs and provide more access thats what he continues to work with speaker ryan on i think the speaker was very clear on it  that theyre having meetings both legislatively and at the principal level to make sure that this gets doneand i think as you heard speaker ryan we continue to be optimistic about getting this thing completed by this year its a mammoth bill what they passed and did it  and i think weve got to make sure that we do this right we dont want to end up with the same result that democrats did they rushed it through no one was able to read the bill and premiums have skyrocketed access and options have gone down we need to make sure that we dont do this in a way thats going to end up with the same resultjohn robertsq  i have a question for you sean though on yemen mr spicer yesq  i did say twoq  one of the worlds most wanted terrorists is now taunting president trump calling him a fool after that raidmr spicer rightq  any response from the white house and do you still stand by your characterization that it was a successful raidmr spicer absolutely that  he was not  that was  the raid that was conducted in yemen was an intelligencegathering raid thats what it was it was highly successful it achieved the purpose it was going to get  save the loss of life that we suffered and the injuries that occurred the goal q  so youre pushing back on reporting that he was a targetmr spicer absolutely he was not  the goal of the raid was intelligencegathering and thats what we received and thats what we got thats why we can deem it a successjohn robertsq  if  and i know that you believe that you have a good case on the merits to lift the temporary restraining order if the president does not prevail at the th circuit court of appeals will he take this to the supreme court mr spicer lets see where we go i think he made it very clear that q  can i just finish mr spicer yes you can im sorryq  and is he concerned that if this does go to the supreme court with its current  makeup that this temporary restraining order might become a little more permanent mr spicer well remember tonight is about just a restraining order were not q  i know what its about thats not the questionmr spicer right i understand but i think that its important to explain this to everyone john because i know you get it and so many others  but i just want to make sure tonight is about the restraining order it has nothing to do with the merits of the case and thats why i think we feel confident the question is does the restraining order get lifted or not but regardless of what happens tonight the merits of the case still need to be  to discuss and i think the merits of the case as they were in boston are ones that we feel very confident on because the law is crystal clear on this the president has the authority to do this it was done so in an interagency process that ensured that all the appropriate people were consulted we went through that with flying colors i have zero concern that at the end of the day well be fine its just a question of going through the processq  and i get all that as you pointed it out but if he does not prevail at the th circuit will he take this case to the supreme courtmr spicer im not going to get  lets see where it goes first i think our goal right now is to get to a point we can argue it on the merits we feel confident based on how the court has reacted in massachusetts that were going to be good on the meritsjonathan swanq  thanks for the question does president trump still plan to immediately terminate president obamas executive amnestiesmr spicer with respect to what daca and dapaq  dapamr spicer ive said this before well have further updates on that go aheadq  but just in the thing it said immediately terminate mr spicer i understand that q  so i just wondered what the delay ismr spicer and ive made it  and ive said before the president will have further updates on both daca and dapa very shortly weve been very clear on immigration  what the presidents priorities would be as you heard secretary kelly testify in front of congress today there is going to be continued progress on the wall and on immigration as a whole so were going to have plenty of time to address this right now hes trying to do it in a very systematic way in accordance to where we find the biggest problems and so hes been very clear in the past that those who are in this country that pose a threat to us or with a criminal record are where his priorities are going to be first and foremost and were going to move through the rest of folks that are in this country illegallysarahq  thank you sean back to iran the ayatollah khamenei said today that trump has helped iran reveal the true face of america he said iran doesnt fear trump and he encouraged iranians to march in the street against america later this week does the president have a response to those very aggressive comments and does he plan to take additional action against iran if its leaders continue to escalate tensionsmr spicer i think the president  or the ayatollah is going to realize that there is a new president in office this president is not going to sit by and let iran flout its violations or its apparent violations to the joint agreementbut he will continue to take action as he sees fit the president has also made clear time and time again that hes not going to project what those actions will be and he will not take anything off the table but i think iran is kidding itself if they dont realize that there is a new president in townjohn gizziq  thank you sean on thursday weather permitting the president is going to meet with airline executives from throughout the country two complaints from airline executives as well as the pilots association have been one that norwegian airlines got a special advantage a foreign carrier permit from the obama administration and also that the airlines of the arab emirates are statesubsidized and both cases are violations of the blue skies act between the us and the eu is this something hes going to address and is he considering upending president obamas foreign carrier permitmr spicer well again that will be something that  that will be decided when they meet what theyll talk about obviously the president is going to want to talk about economic growth and job creation how hes enacting orders to make sure the country is safeon the case of norwegian my understanding if im correct that there is a deal in which theyre having  percent of the crews and the pilots are americanbased theyre flying boeing planes there is a huge economic interest that america has in that deal right now i dont want to get ahead of the president on that but just to be clear i mean when youre talking about us jobs both in terms of the people who are serving those planes and the person whos building those planes thats a very big differencezekeq  thanks sean a few minutes ago you said that the president wanted to remind the american people of how prevalent terrorist attacks are and that the earth is a dangerous place that kind of breaks with the rhetoric weve seen bipartisan administrations use when it comes to terrorist attacks encouraging the american people to go about their daily lives mr spicer thats not the point that  no no no q  does this president have a different message to the american peoplemr spicer i think yeah his message to the american people is that he is fully committed to doing everything that he can to keep the country safe and i think that theres a big difference between what youre saying and the point that he was making yesterday and i think that what hes getting at is making  he was making a point as to the exposure that attacks get and i think thats what he was getting at is that we see these things and theyre becoming too prevalent and thats why i think he wants to become ever vigilant to make sure that we dont ever get lax that we need to be reminded that places and groups like isis continue to seek to do us harm and that it is his job as commanderinchief to do everything he can to get ahead of the curve and keep this country safei think when you look at the poll that came out last week  and i think it was  percent of the american people agree with his proposition to put further restrictions on people to make sure that we have countries who are sending people to our country that they are coming here for peaceful purposes and that if we cant guarantee those countries have the proper vetting and systems in place when they are outbound to the united states then we need to do what we can and he will do what he has to as president to make sure that this country is safeso i think there is a  the point that he was making was not to put fear in anybody but to rather reassure them that as president of the united states he is taking every single step to do what he has to to get ahead of the threats to get ahead of the concerns so were not looking in the rearview mirror thinking what should we have done what could we have done that were preventing lives  whether its the raid in yemen the law that hes enacting  that hes going to do what he can to make sure that this homeland and our people are protected and safemaraq  thank you i just have two questions one on a tweet and one on health care when the president tweeted if something happens blame the judge and the court system did he mean if a terrorist attack is committed by somebody from these seven countries or any terrorist attack should be blamed on the judge and the court systemmr spicer well i think the point that he  the tweet is pretty clear but i think his point is is that  kind of dovetails what i was just saying to zeke  hes doing everything he can and he walks into office  there are seven countries that the obama administration has already identified as not having the proper systems in place to guarantee our safety  and i think his immediate reaction is to do what he has to do to make sure that were not looking back and saying you know what we should have done we should have made sure that we had stricter vetting in place for those seven countriesso he took immediate and decisive action to make sure that this country and our people were protected thats what hes talking about is making sure that we dont have regret that a month from now or two months from now or a year from now we hadnt done something to protect people and so he acted as quick and decisively as possible to make sure that we put the systems in place to protect our people and i dont think theres any other way to read thatq  a question on health care can i just get my second questionmr spicer of courseq  you just said hell negotiate prices and thats something he  he ran on negotiating prices for medicare drug prices and i just want you to clarify where he is on that because when he met with big pharma the other day before the meeting he said we have no choice we have to get prices down after the meeting he said he would oppose anything that makes it harder for these companies to bring their drugs to market including price fixing by medicare so is he for medicare negotiating drug prices or notmr spicer hes for it yes he wants to make sure  q  hes still for itmr spicer absolutelyq  okaymr spicer the president is clear  i mean when you look at the costs of  not just drug costs the us government has not done  i mean you look at what  frankly the easier way to look at this is what other countries have done  negotiating costs to keep those down as drug prices continue to escalate that drives up health care costs for every american but particularly theres a huge burden on americas seniors who are so much more reliant on drug prices and in many cases you have people living on a fix income and health care costs  rising health care costs and prescription drugs continue to be a burden on their ability to live out their lives in a much more enjoyable mannerand so his commitment is to make sure that he does what he can and i think rather successfully uses his skills as a businessman to drive them downmargaretq  sean can you clarify two things mr spicer sureq  one secretary kerry  kelly excuse me when he was on the hill today said that the administration right now is not looking at adding other countries to this temporary travel ban list is the white house still giving itself room to add some countries to that listmr spicer well i think what his point was is is that right now hes not doing it you have to look at his testimony in context i think he went through the fact that were still in this review process that he is committed to making sure that we look at all other countries but as of this moment there is no immediate desire to add to that but he is looking at all of the other countries the procedures that we have with them the systems we have in place to check them and so nothing is final until the end of the review period q  but i had a second question sorry so you said still leaving room to do that something that the president continues to say as a phrase  and im hoping you can define it for us  is that this is about testing who truly loves america and making sure that those who enter the country are those who truly love america how do you quantify that what is the president thinking of is that a specific test what does that meanmr spicer no i mean  look i think theres a  i think the presidents goal is to make sure that people arent coming here to do us harm that theyre going through the proper extreme vetting in cases where we dont have the information required to make a good judgment on them based on what their country is willing to provide that we are taking the proper and necessary steps to protect our peoplebut he doesnt  if someone is coming here to do us harm or to espouse things that would give us a good indication that theyre not coming here for the right reasons then we need to do everything we can to a vet them and b unless were  percent certain keep them out of the countryq  its a background checkmr spicer its a background check but again i wouldnt just  its not i mean it is  to the extent that we can its going to be extreme vetting is what hes talked about that its not going to be just letting someone in on a quick check if theres any cause for concern he wants to go to every step possible to make sure that people who are entering this country are doing so because they want to come here for the right reasons and for peaceful reasonsyeahq  thank you sean on south korea south korea knows about trump is very good friend of theirs and the inaudible most important part of his policy on south koreamr spicer what will what pleaseq  what was most important part of trumps policy towards south koreaq  the most important part of the policy mr spicer thank you look he had a conversation the other day and we look forward to filling that conversation i think obviously the threat of north korea is the most prominent issue that faces south korea in our alliance right now he wants to reassure the south korean government the blue house that we are going to do what we can to make sure that we stand with south korea and that we prevent any further hostile actions from north koreaso i think that the safety of our country of south korea of the region are going to be clearly the greatest focus of thisq  johnchristopher talkmedia news when the president submits his budget is he committed to pushing congress to approve sufficient funding for all american students to have either an outstanding public school education or the public funding for them to reach an outstanding private school educationmr spicer look i think the president has talked extensively about education during the primary whether its an associates degree a bachelors degree a phd or votechnical education that weve got to give students these days the options they need for the workforce that a votech education in some cases is whats in the interest of students in terms of their success and giving them the skills to work on cars or become a computer engineer or whatever but as we head into  as we look towards the future weve got to make sure that were preparing our students to have the skillset that they need and its also the retraining aspect of that  that as people get older and certain industries start to turn the corner because of technology that were allowing people the opportunity for retraining to give them the skillset that they need to reenter the workforce and continue to be productiveso i think as you will see  look we literally will swear in the secretary of education hopefully later this evening which we will let you all know  probably around the  or  hour but that will be something that hes going to continue to have a conversation with secretary devos about something that shes made clear  and its unfortunate that we havent been able to have this conversation sooner because it was held up for so long  but i think thats something that secretary devos will be speaking a lot about about the education funding and skillset and opportunities that we give not just our children but people older in life who are looking to get back into the workforce through another avenueq  how about the k how about the youngstersmr spicer i think well have plenty of time to discuss the presidents budget as we get closer  as he sort of develops that today were excited that secretary devos will get sworn in thanks a lot guys have a great one take careend pm est

regulations and i think its going to be some really very exciting times ahead were going to be doing  were doing it were going to be coming up with a tax bill soon a health care bill even sooner and its really working out toby from the cleveland clinic has been helping us a lot with the veterans and we appreciate that toby youve been amazing and i and all of our friends we really appreciate itone of the things that i heard this morning in watching the news was that amazingly its never happened before that politics has become a much bigger subject than the super bowl  this is usually super bowl territory and i have to say that politics is more interesting to people so thats good i see we have larry here  where is larry fink larry did a great job for me he managed a lot of my money and i have to tell you he got me great returns last year laughter and then they go crazy  theyll meet very smart people that made money why dont you let other people to run the economy i said no we have to get the right people and the people that voted for me understand that and thats what they wantso when i campaigned for office i promised the american people that id ask for our countrys best and brightest and we have that wilbur is representing us as secretary i tell you youre going to be so great  secretary of commerce wilbur ross in fact carl icahn got called up and he goes i hear you got wilbur everybody calls him wilbur ive never heard him called  what we just know him as wilbur right weve got the great jack welch the legendary jack welch we appreciate himwere looking forward in a little while and we have coming in a few moments to discuss all of the things that you think we can do to bring back our jobs to get taxes even lower than what theyll be cutting them we have a great plan but i want to have your input on the plan in particular and to do what we have to do in terms of regulation we have some of the bankers here theres nobody better to tell me about doddfrank than jamie so youre going to tell me about it but we expect to be cutting a lot out of doddfrank because frankly i have so many people friends of mine that have nice businesses that cant borrow money they just cant get any money because the banks just wont let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in doddfrank so well be talking about that jamie in terms of the banking industryand with that i just want to introduce somebody ive known for a long time hes done a fantastic job and were thinking of have these meetings  i think well start maybe on a monthly basis it will go to a quarterly basis because all of a sudden monthly basis sounds like a lotbut we really want your input we have the biggest the brightest in the world theyre in this country in this case we also have a manufacturing group which is worldwide where we have as you know great companies representing but these are the biggest and the best minds in this country and i really appreciate you being here and i want to thank steve and steve is going to say a few wordsmr schwarzman sure well id like to just start out and thank everybody for being here the purpose of this group isnt for general discussion which is okay but the real purpose is to get things done to advise the government as to areas where we can do things a lot better as a country for all americans and debottleneck some thingswe have a full agenda unlike a lot of other meetings that happen of this general type were going to cover some of the immigration things were going to cover regulatory i believe were going to cover tax and trade women in the workplace infrastructure and education and in each of those areas well get suggestions ways to make things happen happen faster to improve the countryand anybody can say anything else they want but its really important that we mobilize the nongovernmental sector and also importantly that we do it on a bipartisan basis apparently a first in washington for a inaudible washington and everybody on the group was selected because theyre terrific because they have domain expertise because they want the country to do better and we had no criteria  we have all kinds of different people from different backgrounds and different political persuasions and if we can make things work right thats the way the country is supposed to workand so its a big sacrifice for the people who are here to spend the time everybody is busy thats america so to puts those things aside to focus on this not just for me but theres prep work that goes into any successful meeting  means these people who attended have taken the time to care about their countryand so thats the spirit in which were approaching things i want to thank everybody on the committee here youre terrific the president thank you very much were going to go around the room but before we do that i just want to say that so many people i call friends of mine in big business and they wanted to be in the committee and i call steve

companies we had some great companies  fiatchrysler sergio and i will tell you i learned a lot about the automobile business i thought i knew a lot but they are being so stymied so restricted with

steelworker here well youre all steelworkers essentially right but you folks have been terrific to me sometimes your top people didnt support me but the steelworkers supported me right a lot of your top people are going to be losing their jobs pretty soon i guess but theyre all coming around  were getting them but the workers supported us big league we want to make it easier for businesses to

taking advantage of us really terribly taking advantage of uswe had one instance in australia  i have a lot of respect for australia i love australia as a country  but we had a problem where for whatever reason president obama said that they were going to take probably well over a thousand illegal immigrants who were in prisons and they were going to bring them and take them into this country

you guys especially the steelworkers understand what im saying right so i just  we have some wonderful allies and were going to keep it that way but we have to be treated fairly also we have to be treated fairly in this administration our allegiance will be to the american workers and to american businesses like harleydavidson that were very strong in the s and i remember this  you were victims of trading abuse  big trading abuse where they were dumping all sorts of competitors all over the place and ronald reagan stepped in and he put on large tariffs and you wouldnt be talking about

policy officers at executive                     departments and agencies and managing                     and executive directors of certain agencies                     and commissionsfrom  dominic j mancini acting administrator        office of information and regulatory affairssubject interim guidance implementing section  of the executive order of january   titled reducing regulation and controlling regulatory costsi general requirementsthis interim guidance in the form of questions and answers qas addresses the requirements in section  regulatory cap for fiscal year  of the executive order of january   titled reducing regulation and controlling regulatory costs eo specifically the guidance explains for purposes of implementing section  in fiscal year  the following requirementsunless prohibited by law whenever an executive department or agency    publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation it shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed sec afor fiscal year    the heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations including repealed regulations to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero unless otherwise required by law or consistent with advice provided in writing by the director of the office of management and budget     sec bin furtherance of the requirement of subsection a of this section any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall to the extent permitted by law be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations sec cin general executive departments and agencies agencies may comply with those requirements by issuing two deregulatory actions described below for each new significant regulatory action that imposes costs the savings of the two deregulatory actions are to fully offset the costs of the new significant regulatory actionin addition beginning immediately agencies planning to issue one or more significant regulatory action on or before september   should for each such significant regulatory actiona reasonable period of time before the agency issues that action identify two existing regulatory actions the agency plans to eliminate or propose for elimination on or before september   andfully offset the total incremental cost of such new significant regulatory action as of september  please consult with your office of information and regulatory affairs oira desk officer if you have any particular questions regarding the applicability or interpretation of the eo not addressed in these qas the office of management and budget omb plans to issue further guidance regarding the application of eo for fiscal years  and beyond soon in addition omb may revise these qascomments on this interim guidance should be provided to reducingregulationombeopgov by february  ii coverageq which new regulations are covereda the eos requirements for fiscal year  apply only to those significant regulatory actions as defined in section f of executive order  an agency issues between noon on january  and september   this includes significant final regulations for which agencies issued a notice of proposed rulemaking before noon on january   significant guidance documents may also be covered see belowplease continue to follow the standard significance determination process outlined in executive order  regulations that affect only other federal agencies and not the public that are issued with respect to a military national security or foreign affairs function of the united states and that are related to agency organization management or personnel are not subject to section s requirementsq what about rules that implement federal spending programsa in general federal spending rules that primarily cause income transfers from taxpayers to program beneficiaries eg rules associated with pell grants and medicare spending are considered transfer rules and are not covered by this eo however in cases where these rules impose requirements on nonfederal entities such as reporting or recordkeeping agencies would need to account for these costs please consult with your oira desk officer on these rules see omb circular a for a discussion of the distinction between transfers and costs generallyq do section s requirements apply to significant regulatory actions of independent agenciesa no the requirements of section  apply only to those agencies required to submit significant regulatory actions to oira for review under eo  nevertheless we encourage independent regulatory agencies to identify existing regulations that if repealed or revised would achieve cost savings that would fully offset the costs of new significant regulatory actionsq are new guidanceinterpretive documents covereda new significant guidance or interpretive documents will be addressed on a casebycase basis consult with your oira desk officer before issuing new significant guidance or regulatory interpretations agencies should continue to adhere to ombs  memorandum on good guidance practices as always agencies should ensure that such documents are the appropriate vehicle for the particular policy goal and that it is clear that compliance with any agency guidance is voluntary any cost savings claimed for guidance or other documents must be specific and verifiableq which existing regulatory actions if repealed or revised would be considered deregulatory actions and thus qualify for savingsa any existing regulatory action that imposes costs and the repeal or revision of which will produce verifiable savings may qualify meaningful burden reduction through the repeal or streamlining of mandatory reporting recordkeeping or disclosure requirements may also qualify agencies should also confirm that they will continue to achieve their regulatory objectives after the deregulatory action is undertaken please consult with your oira desk officer regarding information collections or other actions you believe should qualify as deregulatory actions under sectionq do regulatory actions issued before january  that are vacated or remanded by a court after that date qualify for savingsa generally no based on the presumption that a court determined these regulatory actions were issued at least in part with insufficient legal basis there may be individual cases however where we would consider counting such savings and specifically request comment on this topic as one example the agency may be directed by a court under remand to modify a rule through full notice and comment rulemaking in order address particular issuesq do regulatory actions overturned by subsequently enacted laws qualify for savingsa generally yes we will consider acts of congress that overturn final regulatory actions such as disapprovals of rules under the congressional review act to operate in a similar manner as agency deregulatory actions for the purposes of the requirements of section  of the eoiii accounting questionsq how should costs be measureda costs should be measured as the opportunity cost to society omb circular a defines this conceptq how should agencies account for deregulatory actions that do not outright repeal existing regulations but revise existing requirements to produce real cost savingsa omb will address deregulatory actions that continue to allow agencies to meet regulatory goals on a casebycase basis purely deregulatory actions that confer only savings to all affected parties generally will not trigger the requirement under section a for the agency to identify two existing regulatory actions to be repealed however if such deregulatory actions impose costs on individuals or entities agencies will need to offset those costsq can effects such as future energy cost savings for rules that require the adoption of more energy efficient technologies be counted against the compliance costs of a regulatory action for purposes of section b of the eoa in most circumstances such effects would not be counted as offsets to costs according to oiras reporting conventions for benefitcost analysisq what about costs that occur over different time periodsa all costs estimates should be annualized in accordance with omb circular a while timing issues will be handled on a casebycase basis in general the start and end points for the annualization of costs should be directly comparable across the new and corresponding repealed regulatory actionsq can agencies use previously estimated costs from an original regulatory impact analyses ria in determining the cost savings generated by an eliminated regulatory actiona in general no while the original ria may have information that will be useful in calculating cost savings the most current information available on projected cost savings eg new information on the cost of operating compliance technologies must be included to the extent feasible agencies are also strongly encouraged to use program evaluations and similar techniques to determine the actual cost and other effects of eliminating regulatory actionsq what costs of existing regulatory actions should be counted as cost savings from a deregulatory actiona all costs that would have occurred after the effective date of the repeal of the existing regulatory action should be the basis for the cost savings estimate this means for example that agencies should not count sunk costsq how should costs that duplicate those in another regulatory action be addresseda in general costs should be counted only once in the regulatory action that imposes the legally binding requirement resulting in those costs exceptions should be discussed on a casebycase basis with your oira desk officerq how should agencies treat unquantified costs and cost savingsa these will be handled on a casebycase basis as a general matter the weight assigned to unquantified effects will depend on their significance and degree of certainty see omb circular a for more information on unquantified costsiv process and waiver questionsq which significant regulatory actions might qualify for individual waiversa emergencies addressing critical health safety or financial matters or for some other compelling reason may qualify for a waiver from some or all of the requirements of section  please submit requests for a waiver assessment to your oira desk officer prior to submitting the rule for omb review under eo note that section b of eo applies unless otherwise required by law agencies may proceed with significant regulatory actions that need to be finalized in order to comply with an imminent statutory or judicial deadline even if they are not able to identify offsetting regulatory actions by the time of issuance in the unlikely case where your agency believes other regulatory actions which are not needed to comply with an imminent statutory or judicial deadline are required by law please consult with your oira desk officer in all cases however agencies should identify additional regulatory actions to be repealed in order to offset the cost of the new significant regulatory action even if such action is required by lawq can regulatory and deregulatory actions be bundled in the same regulatory actiona yes under certain circumstances in practice many regulatory actions can both impose new requirements and remove or streamline existing requirements on the same regulated entities and within the same regulatory program in this case the agency must clearly identify the specific provisions that are counted within the regulatory and deregulatory portion of the rules and the costs and cost savings associated with each the net cost impact the difference between costs imposed and cost savings of such rules will generally determine whether they are regulatory actions that need to be offset agencies however should avoid artificially bundling provisions that are not logically connected in a single regulatory actionq what must agencies do to identify existing regulatory actions to be repealeda at a minimum the agency should identify all of the associated regulatory actions to be repealed along with cost saving estimates no later than the date of issuance of the corresponding new significant regulatory action agencies should confirm that they will continue to achieve their regulatory objectives such as health or environmental protection all of the regulatory actions slated for repeal but not yet finalized also must be included in the unified regulatory agendaq do deregulatory actions have to be finalized before new regulatory actions can be finalizeda per section a each agency must identify two existing regulatory actions to be repealed for many significant regulatory actions the most appropriate place for such an identification is in the preamble of the rule being issued for notice and comment or promulgated to the extent feasible regulatory actions should be eliminated before or on the same schedule as the new regulatory action they offset in cases where finalizing an offsetting regulation is not possible agencies should provide a plan for finalizing the offsetting regulation the most appropriate place for such a plan is the preamble of the rule being issued the plan should include a commitment to include the offsetting regulation in the next addition of the unified regulatory agenda with dates for any required regulatory actions and estimates of the associated cost savingsq how does this eo interact with other eos and guidance addressing regulatory activitiesa all requirements under other eos and implementing guidance eg eo  and omb circular a remain applicableq can savings be transferred within an agencya yes the requirements of this eo apply agencywide regulatory savings by a component in one agency can be used to offset a regulatory burden by a different component in that same agencyq can savings be transferred from other agenciesa agencies that are not able to generate sufficient savings to account for new regulatory actions they must issue may

2017-02-01,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/1/2017, #6 ",james s brady press briefing room pm estmr spicer good afternoon everybody thanks for coming last night the president was honored to announce judge neil gorsuch as his nominee to serve as the next justice to the supreme court it was an unbelievably phenomenal evening immediately after being announced judge gorsuch was honored to meet with maureen and father scalia as some of you have reported his first call after coming back behind the podium was to merrick garland who i would also note has already come out to say that judge gorsuch deserves a fair hearingin less than  hours judge gorsuch has already received widespread praise from across the political spectrum as an inspired choice with sterling academic credentials a brilliant legal mind and a steadfast commitment to constitutional principlesduring his long career in public service judge gorsuch has enjoyed bipartisan approval having previously been confirmed by a voice vote to the us court of appeals for the th circuit in fact  current democratic senators  including minority leader chuck schumer senator dianne feinstein senator leahy  were all in office when he was first confirmed without opposition in with as many as eight democrats like senators blumenthal durbin mccaskill already supporting a full hearing and vote for judge gorsuch there is no question that he is a widely respected jurist who deserves to have his nomination fairly decided upon by the united states senatenow that judge gorsuch has been officially named i hope you all allow me to talk for a moment about how exceptionally qualified he is to succeed the late great antonin scaliajudge gorsuchs academic record is impeccable and as he said last night the president holds education in the highest regard judge gorsuch graduated phi kappa beta sic from columbia graduated cum laude from harvard law school and attended oxford as a recipient of the prestigious marshall scholarshiplike justice scalia the cornerstone of judge gorsuchs judicial philosophy is fidelity to the text he believes that judges should base their decisions solely on the law and the  he believes  sorry i almost screwed that one up  laughter  he believes his decision should be based solely on the law and the constitution not on their own policy preferences or personal feelings he will be a reliable and principled voice on the bench preserving equal justice under the law regardless of backgroundand i would note i think  and i always want to caveat this  but to my understanding i think he would be the first justice that will serve with the  as someone he clerked for on the bench so it will be a sort of first when he is confirmed by the senatenow on to the issues of the day today is february st which means we are kicking off black history month the president has events planned throughout the month starting today with a listening session that occurred earlier this morning with african american leaders in the roosevelt room the meeting also included some of the administrations african american appointeeslater today the president will issue a proclamation the us postal service kicked off the month by issuing the dorothy height forever stamp the th stamp in their black heritage series dr height led the national council of negro women for four decades and was awarded the presidential medal of freedom by president bill clinton in  and the congressional medal of freedom by president george w bush in   excuse me  and  president obama delivered her eulogy in  and president trump is now proud that the post office is honoring her incredible legacy as a civil rights iconat events throughout this entire month well celebrate the contributions of courageous african american leaders  from harriet tubman and frederick douglass to martin luther king jr and clarence thomas african american history is american history and this month is a great reminder of thatcontinuing with todays schedule the vice president went to the hill with judge gorsuch to meet with lawmakers for the first time since being named last night on the hill the vice president met with majority leader mcconnell and the staff spearheading judge gorsuchs nomination will also meet with senators cornyn grassley hatch and gardnerwith judge gorsuch on capitol hill i think its a good time to talk about the confirmation process neither of the two supreme court justices that president obama nominated were subject to the vote threshold of a senate filibuster they received bipartisan support because republicans despite some political and philosophical differences viewed them as mainstream and qualified and judge gorsuch should receive the same fair treatmentalso this morning the president met in the roosevelt room with representatives of outside groups to discuss judge gorsuchs nomination including david osteen of the national right to life paula white of the new destiny christian centerwayne lapierre of the national rifle association penny nance of concerned women of america charmaine yoest of american values juanita duggan of the national federation of independent businesses tom collamore of the united states chamber of commerce grover norquist of americans for tax reform leonard leo of the federalist society marjorie dannenfelser of the susan b anthony list and morton blackwell of the leadership institutepresident trump told the group that his decision on the supreme court is among the most important decisions he will ever make as president he praised judge gorsuch for his academic and professional achievements and his lifelong devotion to the lawthe attendees thanked the president for making such an inspired choice and for delivering on what was for many of them their number one issue in the campaign they committed vocally to supporting judge gorsuch throughout the confirmation process and expressed their desire for the senate to move swiftly to give him a fair hearing and vote the meeting closed with the president inviting the group in the oval office which several attendees really enjoyed that honorthe president then had lunch with secretary of state designee tillerson mr tillersons tenacity broad experience and deep understanding of the geopolitics are going to make him an outstanding chief diplomat for the united states and the president is looking forward to the full vote of the senate on his nominationlater this evening the president will participate in a standing legislative affairs strategy meeting with his team who have been working closely with congress to enact the presidents agenda so far between the vice president and staff weve had many productive conversations with members of both parties in both chambers on a variety of issues from trade to the presidents nomination for the cabinet and now the supreme courtnow starting this week our legislative affairs team will also conduct extensive outreach on behalf of judge gorsuchs nomination process clearly this administration has made reaching out to congress a top priority but you know where im going with that democrats in the senate continue to use every tool at their disposal to try and get in the way of the presidents attempts to make america great againjust today senate democrats again refused to even participate in committee votes for senate sicdesignees price and mnuchin who were moved out of the finance committee with zero democrats present democrats also boycotted epa administratordesignee pruitts hearing theyre doing their constituents and our country a disservice by resorting to these childish tactics the presidents cabinet nominees will be confirmed on the floor of the senate once democrats actually allow them to get a fair votein other cabinet news attorney generaldesignee senator jeff sessions was voted out of committee today we look forward to his full vote as the next attorney generaladditionally secretary of

meetings will be coming soona few personnel announcements today the president sent the following nominations to the senate rachel l brand of iowa to be associate attorney general steven andrew engel of dc to be assistant attorney general and rod j rosenstein of maryland to be a deputy attorney generalon another note yesterday we talked about recent reporting concerning the presidents executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry i wanted to draw your attention to some polls that have come out on that subject for all the hysteria around the implementation of this order the american people as a whole are very supportive of the action that the president is taking a new rasmussen report polls finds that  percent  which is a clear majority  of likely us voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from syria iraq iran libya somalia sudan yemen until the government can do a better job of keeping these individuals out who pose a threata reuters poll found that  percent of americans believe that the united states should limit the number of refugees into the country and the safety of the american people and the security of the american homeland are the presidents top priorities and most americans agree with the steps that hes taking to keep our country safefurther today the united arab emirates foreign minister voiced his support for the presidents decision to take our national security so seriously the foreign minister also added that he believes the restrictions are not based on religion but on the structural problems faced by these nations i know that there was a question on monday regarding irans firing of a missile and attack on a navy vessel id like to introduce national security advisor general michael flynn to provide a quick updategeneral flynn good afternoon everyone recent iranian actions involving a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a saudi naval vessel conducted by iransupported houthi militants underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about irans destabilizing behavior across the entire middle eastthe recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of un security council resolution  which calls upon iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons including launches using such ballistic missile technology these are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which houthi forces that iran has trained and armed have struck emirati and saudi vessels and threatened united states and allied vessels transiting the red sea in these and other similar activities iran continues to threaten us friends and allies in the region the obama administration failed to respond adequately to tehrans malign actions including weapons transfers support for terrorism and other violations of international norms the trump administration condemns such actions by iran that undermine security prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the middle east which places american lives at riskpresident trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between iran the obama administration as well as the united nations as being weak and ineffective instead of being thankful to the united states in these agreements iran is now feeling emboldened as of today we are officially putting iran on noticethank youmr spicer thanks general we are going to have a background briefing with nsa staff  nsc staff rather today at  pm here in the briefing room further details will be provided on that subject so thank you general with thatas we start off i mentioned yesterday im pleased that weve expanded the briefing room  at least virtually and so with that as i begin to take your question im pleased to offer the firstever skype seat question in the white house briefing room to kim kalunian from wpri in rhode islandkimq  thank you good afternoon can you hear me okaymr spicer we canq  great just this week the mayor of providence rhode island began calling our capital city a sanctuary city as we know president trumps executive order says the white house will begin publicizing a weekly list of these municipalities and pledges to withdraw federal grant money from them what im wondering is is how soon we can expect to see this list and how soon should cities like providence expect to see their federal funding cutmr spicer thanks kim i think the presidents goal in ending sanctuary cities is pretty clear we want to as we mentioned with these other actions keep america safe the goal is to make sure on two fronts one we are doing everything we can to protect american citizens institutions and ending sanctuary cities is one of the ways in which we can continue to do that furthermore the president has been very clear through his executive order that federal funds paid for by hardworking taxpayers should not be used to help fund sanctuary cities as we continue to implement this executive order and fulfill the pledge that he made well have further updates on how we tend to  on how that list will come out and when it will come out so i look forward to following up on that as wellwith that david jacksonq  david isnt here but ill ask a question laughtermr spicer go for it laughterq  maybe hes on skype laughterq  the presidents daily briefing has been renamed the daily intelligence briefing can you tell me how that differs at all from the pdb is the president receiving his intelligence briefing in writing or orally and who is giving it to himmr spicer he did receive an intelligence briefing today congressman  or director pompeo was here general flynn his national security advisor his briefer so he receives an intelligence briefing and the pbd every dayq  is there any sense that we should get out of the renaming of it from the pdbmr spicer i think it is a more comprehensive  again i think  we went through this during the transition period right there is a difference between the raw intelligence and the analysis and i think he is constantly updated by his national security team and other intelligence officials but every single day he does receive the pbd and then i think on top of that he is receiving intelligence briefings from his team q  but the oral briefing does not necessarily happen every daymr spicer well i can get back to you on that he does get the pbd every day and on a daily basis meets with his intelligence team yesq  two quick questionsmr spicer were not going to do this againq  on black history monthmr spicer yeahq  is president obama being invited to any of the black history month celebrationsmr spicer not that im aware of its day one we just started it off well have to get back to you on further details i think q  and if i may mr spicer we have a lot  theres a lot of activities as i mentioned that the president is going to do to celebrate and honor this month and this was just the first day of the month of februaryq  and today he made the comment about frederick douglass being recognized more and more do you have any idea what specifically he was referring tomr spicer well i think theres contribution  i think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made and i think through a lot of the actions and statements that hes going to make i think the contributions of frederick douglass will become more and morekristenq  thank you very quickly can you clarify what was meant by were putting iran on noticemr spicer well as i mentioned i think general flynn and the nsc staff will have a briefing at  pm they can go forward im not going to  i think we wanted to make very clear that we felt as though that  their actions were both provocative and a violation and making sure that they understood that we werent going to sit by and not act on those actionsq  are you building the case to mr spicer im just  im not going to go any further than that kristenq  okay then let me ask you about  let me just ask you about the confirmation hearings how does the president plan to get chuck schumer onboard with his pick for the supreme court neil gorsuch when he has referred to him as a clown and accused him of fake tearsmr spicer well i think those are two things i think were going to  you look at the support thats already come out i think theres eight senators already that have talked about the need to have a vote and his qualifications and not just the senate but i mean you look at the widespread support that came out for judge gorsuch last night across the spectrum no matter your philosophical view of the court i think his qualifications for the court his academic background make him an unbelievably highly qualified personand so its not just chuck schumer i think the rest of the senate as he goes up there  but i think the interesting thing q  sure mr spicer hold on hold on i understand that and i think chuck schumer has shown time and time again through this confirmation process with the cabinet that hes more interested in politics than actually moving the government along and i think that is troublingi would ask you that  i think that the question needs to be asked to chuck schumer why are you stalling all of these nominees why are you insisting on new requirements that you didnt assume for sotomayor or kagan i mean theres a point at which they need to get asked why are they obstructing government at every step of the way theres an element to which they need to be held accountable as well they held certain standards in place for their nominees both for the bench and for the cabinet and the question is are they going to live up to the same standards that they imposed on republicans when they had nominees in a democratic white houseq  but does the president think that by personally insulting chuck schumer thats a way to get mr spicer but again kristen i think the goal is to get  when  but again i would go back chuck schumer is not innocent in this theres a lot of comments that hes made and a lot of accusations that hes thrown out there and a lot of politics that hes played at some point chuck schumer needs to be held accountable for his actions and his words blakeq  sean the president today invoked the possibility on the supreme court sean of the possibility of going the route of the nuclear option if it gets to that point is the white house comfortable with that pathmr spicer well i think the president made clear his goal today which is number one he believes that judge gorsuch is unbelievably qualified and that he will get nominated  not only confirmed but done so with a large bipartisan vote as i said at the outset republicans looked at the qualifications of the two justices that got through in the obama administration and while they may not have agreed with their judicial philosophy definitely agreed that they were qualified on the merits to be confirmed and they did soi think that we would ask that we be held to the same standard that the democrats used when they had nominees up but i think the president made very clear that the decision is something that we would rather not have to go down but also that it is ultimately up to senator mcconnell and how he wants to operate thisjohn gizziq  thank you sean just one question today leading up to judge gorsuchs announcement last night and him coming out after there were still rumors that judge hardiman was going to be nominated and he in fact drove to washingtonmr spicer no actually john he didnt that was media  that was misreporting my understanding is that judge hardiman never left the commonwealth of pennsylvania so with all due respect i cant be held accountable for reports that falsely stated that he was here he never was at the white house my understanding is he had a meeting in eastern pennsylvania with another judge but it was  and again im not  i dont track his whereabouts but my understanding is he never left the commonwealth of pennsylvania yesterday so it was  we announced when we were going to make this announcement i think it was a phenomenal way to introduce judge gorsuch to the american people and the united states senate we invited democratic leaders democratic members of the senate judiciary committee unfortunately none of them showed up but it was an opportunity for them and the american people to see an amazing choice that the president made for the benchanitaq  my question sean my question is mr spicer you said one johnq  but i didnt ask the question my question is simply this with the support that he received the people who called the president would it be safe to say that judge hardiman will be on deck if there is another vacancy soon  say justice kennedy retiring by the end of the termmr spicer well i think theres a lot of vacancies that we see at the appellate level and throughout the government hes an impressive impressive jurist obviously the four that really made that final list for the president were unbelievably impressive so i dont want to get in front of the presidenthopefully he continues to have the presidents support and is someone that the president was unbelievably impressed with so well have to see what vacancies come down the pipeanitaq  i know you love when we say we have two questions i do have two quick questions about something you mentioned at the top first you mentioned the three folks that are being nominated to the department of justice why are they being nominated now before senator sessions is there is it because theres a lack of people was he consulted or is it just because of the whole issue this week with the acting attorney generalmr spicer its the normal process of getting those  ive mentioned at a few briefings  the deputies the unders and the actings are in the pipeline we announced one the other day for homeland weve got commerce was previously announced and so this is just a continuation of the process to fill q  so would then senator sessions  i mean in speaking with him mr spicer of course these are people that he is clearly aware of and supportive of  percentq  okay and then the second question was you mentioned tomorrow the meeting with the harley davidson executives theres reporting that he was supposed to go to milwaukee tomorrow or he was supposed to that was canceled because of the company can you talk about thatmr spicer i just think  look it was easier for the executives to come here considering the week and all of the activity thats been going on and we figured the easiest thing to do was  again no decision had been made about or announced as to what we were doing we looked at different options and ultimately the easiest thing to do in accordance with the presidents schedule was to invite them here to washington to talk about some of the stuff that weve been doingq  are you worried about protestingmr spicer were not concerned i think were not concerned about that were concerned about american jobs moving this economy forward and were excited to welcome them here to washington to talk about the great work that they do and the many thousands of people that they employwith that let me go to the  were going to be here a while guys well go to the second skype seat natalie herbick from fox  in cleveland ohio natalieq  secretary spicer thank you so much for this rare opportunity i appreciate it and im learning the ropesmr spicer natalie youre coming back laughterq  and i would like to quickly ask two questions if i may the first one being president trump has been quick to take action on several issues hes addressed along the campaign trail and with that in mind he made a stop here in cleveland and he said that he would like to make cities like ours the economic envy of the world  a bold statement so our viewers would love to know an example a specific example as to how he plans to do this sooner than latermr spicer thats a great question natalie i think its not just cleveland but its detroit and so many of the other cities around the country youve heard the president talk about the need to rebuild our inner cities we were really impressed with cleveland this past july  we went there for the national convention  the people of cleveland their desire and the rebound that the city has taken and i think that when you go to  whether its a city like cleveland or detroit through different tax and regulatory measures theres a way that we can continue to bring manufacturing back we can continue to bring jobs back and whether its harley davidson or carrier or lockheed or boeing or the gm fiat ford these companies he continues to talk with about how they can bring jobs back relocate i think that was again another one of the conversations that he had with the pharmaceutical companies yesterday how can they bring jobs back how can we ease regulations to do thatso its about making sure that we have an environment natalie that allows more cities to compete to grow the manufacturing base and to recognize the things that we can do taxwise and regulatorywise to allow that to flourishceciliaq  thank you and steve bannon can be heard on recording saying islam is a dark religion not a religion of peace a religion of submission does the president share his chief strategists apparent beliefs on islammr spicer no i think the president has been very clear that his number one goal is not to target any one religion but places and areas where we believe that there is an issue thats what the executive order was all about the other day  making sure that areas that we dont feel have the proper mechanisms in place to assure the security  that when they travel to the united states that we know that theyre coming here for peaceful purposesthe presidents numberone goal has always been to focus on the safety of america not the religion he understands that its not a religious problem its a radicalization problem theres a big difference between islam the religion and radical islamic terrorists that come here to seek to do us harmq  but nothing about his comment that the president wants to distance himself from or even elaborate onmr spicer i just think i made it clear that theres a difference between the presidents viewyeahq  thanks there have been multiple reports of people landing saturday in the us with valid visas who were denied entry and placed on flights back out of the country so thats in violation of at least five of these federal judges orders that came down is the white house working to ensure that those people illegally deported can return to the us and are these court orders causing any second thinking about certain aspects of the ordermr spicer well i think that we just  we issued earlier today some clarification  an update from the counsels office that clarifies section c and e that legal permanent residents lprs do not  that the waiver  you no longer need a waiver initially as the program was lifting off the idea was that they would go through be granted a waiver of which everyone was issued a waiver coming inin the sake of efficiency we have interpreted the guidance to all of these agencies to both the acting secretary of state the acting attorney general and the secretary of homeland security that the guidance is  that all individuals are responsible for the administration implementation of this order  that that does not apply they no longer need a waiver because if they are a legal permanent resident they wont need it anymoreq  seanmr spicer yeahq  on glasssteagall the president during his campaign said that he supported a reestablishing of glasssteagall legislation which would separate the investment banks from the commercial banks theres legislation on both the house and the senate side its in the republican program mr mnuchin when he was queried on the hill by senator cantwell who is the author of one of the bills was a little bit more ambiguous on this issue and i wish you could say something on where this president stands on thismr spicer i think part of the reason that its  weve got to get a treasury secretary confirmed and i think that when we sit here and get asked questions about policy and you go department after department  whether its treasury energy epa hhs hud education  the list goes on and on and so you ask about issues and where the presidents agenda is well the reason that the president nominated these highly qualified people was to implement his agenda and senate democrats continue to hold that up and i think when you  you cant  youre asking us about how were going to move forward on an agenda whether its glasssteagall or so many other issues and at the same time the democrats are holding up the confirmation of these highly qualified people until that occurs it makes it a heck of a lot harderq  but the president mr spicer major garrettq   still supports glasssteagallmr spicer the presidents position is consistent yesq  sean a broad topic id like you to take on which is dissent within the administration and specifically related to the presidents lunch with rex tillerson today more than  employees at the state department foreign service officers and others have signed this dissentgape is it the presidents position that rex tillerson when hes confirmed should go through the formal process meet with those people and have a dialogue as previous secretaries of state have and is it the presidents point of view that when there is dissent it can be rooted in a philosophical disagreement thats not necessarily in defiance of his orders and that there can be a dialogue and that it can maybe inform him differently about policymr spicer sure i think the president has always q  because you said a couple days ago they should get out if they mr spicer no no no i think theres a difference just to be clear on this  every american has a right to speak their mind thats one of the amazing beauties of this country you have the ability to write what you want through our first amendment and people have a right to speak out and thats not hampered the point that i was making then is that if you believe so deeply that the policy is offensive to you then you have to understand that the job the way our government works is we elect a president and that president gets to carry through their agenda that they set out with the american people during the campaign  and so they have a right to express it and i think secretary tillerson for those who have gotten to meet him has a very open mind and a desire to meet with people and hear ideas as does the president as evidenced through what did through the transition and what hes done since hes become president he has met with groups businesses associations republicans democrats independents that have been supportive of him that have not been supportive of him and i think that hes going to continue to do thatso people have a right to speak their mind but i think theres a difference between expressing dissent and concern and not implementing a lawful order as the acting attorney general did the other night but again i dont mean to keep coming back to this but youre asking what well do when rex tillerson becomes and part of the problem right now is i cant fully answer your question because democrats are holding up and slowwalking this nomination so to presuppose what rex tillerson is going to do  you know again i just  its ironic that were being asked what these secretaries will do when they get into office and the democrats wont let them assume this when we all know that the votes are there for themq  but im just talking about a particular process that has historically been inaudible in the state departmentmr spicer i understand that and i think  but again i think for me to presuppose what secretarydesignee tillerson is going to do prior to him actually getting sworn in i dont  he probably will i dont know but it would be irresponsible of me to answer a question about what hes going to do before he actually gets sworn inq  thanks sean senate democrats have been described as bitter over the manner in which judge merrick garland was treated when he was nominated for the supreme court do you feel does the president feel that that bitterness is wellfoundedmr spicer i dont know im not a senate democrat i think they have a right to feel the way they do i think weve explained our position both during last year when this was going on that we felt as though this was up to the voters to make a decision on and as i pointed out yesterday so many voters made up their mind based on who they believe the candidates would appoint mr trump  then mr trump  thencandidate trump now president trump was very clear about the type of people that he was going to put forth first in a list of  and then in a list of  additional ones so i think the american people knew clearly where he was going to go he followed through on that campaign promise and i think that when you look at the number of people who solely based their vote on that never mind it was  and then you expand that it was pretty clear that that was an important factor in the electionso i understand it but i also think thats  we had an election it was a major issue in that election and i think that even when you look across the spectrum  republican democrat liberal conservative  judge gorsuch has an unbelievable record and is being praised for that record because of thatq  i want to ask about friday and theres been some reporting that there will be a meeting with president trump and jp morgan ceo and others can you tell us a little bit more about who else will be there and where things are at on financial reform what message does the president have for bankers specifically on financial reform weve heard so much about obamacare and tax reform but it seems like financial reform has sort of fallen by the waysidemr spicer well i wouldnt agree with that i think that when you look at regulatory reform and tax reform and all of the steps that hes been taking to help the economy grow and to create jobs thats right in that wheelhouse i hope to have further updates on the schedule for you tomorrow but i dont now maraq  thank you sean i have question about foreign policy but i wanted to follow up you said that lprs no longer need a waiver but you didnt answer the question about what about the people who were put on planes people who were lprs but would put on planes back to where they came from what happens to themmr spicer well again i think then they go through the process it depends if theyre an lpr if not then they go through the application process so if they are an lpr a legal permanent resident then they are waived they can come right throughq  so they can come back againmr spicer thats right but i dont know how many cases that applies to i know that if theyre not a legal permanent resident then they have to go back and thats part of this vetting processq  sean q  wait my question is about the fighting in ukraine and russiabacked rebels are moving the lines forward and im wondering if the president feels that russia is testing him because this is coming so early in his administration before hes had a chance to fully assemble his team and what he plans to do about itmr spicer the president has been kept aware of through his national security council and his national security team as a whole whats been going on in the ukraine and well have further updates as we go onq  during the campaign last january donald trump promised that on his first day in office he would get rid of gunfree zones in schools and on military bases when can we expect action on that and if so can you share details of what we should expectmr spicer yeah i think youve seen that the president has been very active in terms of getting executive orders out and following up on the campaign pledges that he made to the american people last night being another example of that were going to continue to move through this process and i think well have further updates on where we are with respect to the rest of the eo processwith that i want to go to my third skype seat lars larson of the lars larson show q  commander spicer its a pleasure thanks for your service to america and thanks for the opportunity ive got a broad question the federal government is the biggest landlord in america it owns twothirds of a billion acres of america i dont think the founders ever envisioned it that way does president trump want to start returning the peoples land to the people and in the meantime for a second question  since thats in fashion these days  can he tell the forest service to start logging our forests aggressively again to provide jobs for americans wealth for the treasury and not spend  billion a year fighting forest firesmr spicer thanks lars i think the president has been very clear that as part of an overall comprehensive energy solution that weve got to utilize the resources that we have that the federal government owns whether thats the forests or natural resources or minerals that exist above and below the ground that we have too infrequently looked at our own resources and counted too much on foreign sources of energyso were going to continue as congressman zinke goes through the process to head up the interior department and governor perry goes through his appointment  his confirmation process to get those individuals through but then working together in areas where they have overlap and also on areas where they will act individually to realize to look at those natural resources that we have and figure out how to best utilize them to benefit not just our energy but also economic growth opportunities with thatdaniel happer phq  i was wondering about executive orders you havent really explained why the president is using the executive orders in the manner that hes doing so why not take this extreme vetting to congress and have a congressional bill and why not  i mean what is the philosophy behind mr spicer well i dont think its a binary choice daniel i dont think its only do this i think he has talked about  especially in the area of immigration  hes been very very clear that this a huge priority for him and i think that he is going to continue to look at this from a holistic aspect in other words visas visa reform the wall our southern border our northern border  all of these things that  you know vetting those are very very comprehensive and those things in which he can do through executive order and action he will those things that he can do through working with congress legislatively hes going to continue to do as welltoluse from bloombergq  the presidents top trade advisor peter navarro told the financial times yesterday that he believes that the euro is grossly unvalued and germany is benefiting from that and thats why we have a huge trade deficit with germany and with europe does the president agree with that that the euro is undervalued and if so does he plan to do anything about itmr spicer i think when it comes to currency valuation im not going to get  i think weve got a secretary of treasury thats in the confirmation process and once that happens i think then secretary mnuchin will be able to address that as well q  sean dan hausle news of boston id like to ask you about kelly ayottes role shepherding mr spicer i was hoping you were going to ask about the patriots laughterq  well i would like to ask you about thatmr spicer youll get a second  laughter q  okay ill get a second but can you talk about kelly ayottes role shepherding justice gorsuch around capitol hillmr spicer sure look senator ayotte is someone whos respected on both sides of the aisle she has a lot of great relationships shes a former attorney general she understands the judicial process very well but shes also  i mean this process is a relationship process by and far youre going around introducing a judge someone who has not generally been exposed to the legislative process definitely not the congressional process q  her relationship with president trump was stranger in the campaign and kind of mr spicer thats right and i think that that goes and shows as ive mentioned several times both through the transition and early the president is not holding some kind of test about what degree of support you had for him he wants the best and brightest to continue to serve this country in whatever capacity they can i think senator ayotte very very helpfully offered up her services shes got a lot of relationships on both sides of aisle shes got a tremendous amount of experience in this field and i think the president thought she was extremely qualified to do this to help shepherd this unbelievably qualified justice through this processand so she as well as the team that weve gathered of individuals on staff here are going to help get judge gorsuch through the nomination process and i would say just as a side note that if you look at the amazing job that has been done by the team during the transition and now to get these amazing individuals through the process despite all of the hype that continues to go about this individual is going to face this problem or which is the one person  each of them have really sailed through this process and story after story says democrats have tried to land a  take them out and couldnt land a glove theyre unbelievably qualified theyre unbelievably prepared and i think that the same process that we followed with this is going to be followed with judge gorsuch and i think were going to have a very speedy q  as a followup  as an unbiased rhode island native can you offer your super bowl pick and president trump has also showed quite an affinity for tom brady and mr spicer i will i think you know where i come down on that one q  thanks sean senators murkowski and collins both say theyre going to vote no on betsy devoss nomination that leaves zero votes to spare and vice president pence would have to cast the tiebreaking vote so my questions are how confident are you that you have all of the other republican senators locked down and whats the level of concern in the white house that her nomination is going to failmr spicer zero i am  percent confident she will be the next secretary of education she is an unbelievably qualified educator and advocate for students teachers parents i think that the games that are being played with betsy devos are sad she is someone whos been a tireless advocate over the last couple decades to really support reforms that benefit children and they are going to be the real winners with her as the secretary of educationsarah murrayq  in terms of both the two republican senators who are voting no on betsy devos and the outcry we saw from republicans on the hill last week  earlier this week about how you guys dealt with the travel ban first is there more that the trump administration and trump himself should be doing to ensure that his party is on the same page with his priorities and secondly on the yemen raid can you give us more of an understanding of was there a discussion about the risks involved in this was it a straightforward decision and do you guys still view it to be a success in spite of the death of a navy sealmr spicer so first i would just note sarah that ive heard story after story in the last  days about how whether  going back to the last question about these nominees and not getting through rex tillerson was going to go down and soandso was going to  and every one of them after they got to meet with senators of both sides of the party have shown why the president chose them  because they were unbelievably qualified unbelievably ready to lead and enact an agenda of change in the area of responsibility that theyre taking over and i think the same is going to be true for everyone else who is remainingq  but two members of your own party disagreemr spicer the vote hasnt taken place i think weve had some concerns in the past and i think when these nominees have met with them and shared with them their thoughts throughout the process  and again you can go back story after story and again each one of these folks who ive heard isnt going to make it is going to go over the finish line each time and i think that  we hear it over and over again and yet we succeed every time and yet another roadblock is put up  well this person wont succeed and yet you look at each one of these people going through the process and its worked beautifully every time and i think were going to continue that pathwith respect to yemen i think its hard to ever say something was successful when you lose a life but youve got to understand that chief owens  he went back deployed  times because he loved this country and he believed in the mission and knowing that we killed an estimated  aqap members and that we gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on american soil is something that i think most servicemembers understand that thats why they join the serviceand so you never want to call something a success  percent when someone is hurt or killed and that was the case here but i think that when you recognize that an individual like this loved this country so much and deployed over and over again because he knew that the mission that he was conducting was so important to our protection our freedom our safety and i know that when the president spoke to karen his wife and talked about the three children that he left behind she continued to be impressed with  to impress upon the president rather that while it was an unbelievably sad and emotional time for her and her family that he loved doing thisand so again i dont think you ever call anything  percent success but what he did for this nation and what we got out of that mission i think i truly believe  and i know the president believes  its going to save american liveswith that let me go to the last question on skype and then well continue jeff jobe of south central kentucky  of the jeff jobe publishing in south central kentuckyjeffq  thank you for allowing me to be part of todays white house press briefing clearly anyone paying attention will see that president trump is aggressively acting on his campaign promises this in itself gives hope to my state and particularly the region in which i grew up appalachia weve seen countless politicians make promises at both state and national levels and not only forget us but to turn on us so my question is how soon or when will the roles restricting coal mining coal burning and coal exports be reversedmr spicer thanks jeff ive talked about this a couple times so far but i believe  or the president has very clearly stated that clean coal in particular is an issue thats so important to our energy independence as well as our job creation in this country and so whether youre talking about kentucky or west virginia or pennsylvania or so many other places in this country that rely on coal bringing the production of clean coal back is good for our energy independence is good for our economy is good for job creation and is something that he continues to talk about and i think once we have the secretary of energy confirmed that we can continue to take steps to move forward with q  two questions for you after the primetime announcement last night it seems like the numbers were good do you have a sense that this president will be more aggressive than his predecessors on seeking primetime air play for his announcements and two top democrats are asking the defense department to investigate michael flynns possible violation of the constitution do you have a  it sounds like you saw that story do you have a response to thatmr spicer yeah i think on the air time issue thats something that were not particularly suffering from when it comes to attention and i think the president does a phenomenal job of getting attention and getting his message out his use of social media in particular that when you look at the number of people  i think we had something like  million people watching the address on facebook live last night obviously if we have important issues to discuss with the nation or announcements to make or nominations then well request time i dont think that thats something that weve spent a ton of time figuring out i think were doing pretty well on that frontand then im sorry the second question mikeq  the request from democrats to investigate flynn for a possible violation of the emoluments clausemr spicer yeah so general flynn like i think probably countless if not hundreds of retired flag officers joins his speaking bureau and has given speeches at various places and i think that is something that is kept in practice and the department of defense is the appropriate place for them to review it but as i said i think that when you look at so many countless retired flag officers thats something that generally keeps inaudiblezekeq  thanks sean general flynn when he was up here offered some criticism about the obama administrations handling of iran in particular is that something we should be expecting to hear more from this administration whether it be on foreign policy or other issues  criticism of the previous administration going forwardmr spicer i think in area where theres going to be a sharp difference in particular national security in contrasting the policies that this president is seeking to make the country safer stronger more prosperous hes going to draw those distinctions and contrast out but in this particular area i think the president when it came to the iran nuclear deal was very very adamant in his opposition to the deal and to its implications and so hes going to continue to make sure that the american people know that some of these deals and things that were left by the previous administration that he wants to make very clear what his position is and his opposition to them and the action and the notice that he put iran on today is something that is important because i think the american people voted on change again this is another issue that he was very clear aboutso with that thank you guys ill see you tomorrow take care have a good dayend pm est
