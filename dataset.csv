Additionally, in order to ensure these outcomes, it is the intention of my Administration to deal directly with individual countries on a one-on-one (or bilateral) basis in negotiating future trade deals. Trade with other nations is, and always will be, of paramount importance to my Administration and to me, as President of the United States.Based on these principles, and by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby direct you to withdraw the United States as a signatory to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), to permanently withdraw the United States from TPP negotiations, and to begin pursuing, wherever possible, bilateral trade negotiations to promote American industry, protect American workers, and raise American wages.You are directed to provide written notification to the Parties and to the Depository of the TPP, as appropriate, that the United States withdraws as a signatory of the TPP and withdraws from the TPP negotiating process.You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.DONALD J.

2,2017-01-24,Memorandum: Implementation of Regulatory Freeze,"M-17-16MEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS AND ACTING HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIESFROM: Mark Sandy,Acting DirectorSUBJECT: Implementation of Regulatory FreezeThis Memorandum provides guidance on implementing the Memorandum of January 20, 2017, entitled ""Regulatory Freeze Pending Review"" (""Freeze Memo"").Postponement of Effective Dates of Certain Published RegulationsParagraph 3 of the Freeze Memo instructs your departments and agencies (""agencies"") as follows:With respect to regulations that have been published in the [Federal Register] but have not taken effect, as permitted by applicable law, temporarily postpone their effective date for 60 days from the date of this memorandum, subject to the exceptions described in paragraph 1, for the purpose of reviewing questions of fact, law, and policy they raise. Where appropriate and as permitted by applicable law, you should consider proposing for notice and comment a rule to delay the effective date for regulations beyond that 60 day period. In cases where the effective date has been delayed in order to review questions of fact, law, or policy, you should consider potentially proposing further notice-and-comment rulemaking.Your agency staff has identified or should promptly identify regulation[1] that have been published in the Federal Register but have not yet taken effect. For such regulations, paragraph 3 of the Freeze Memo instructs your agency to undertake several actions.First, absent applicable exceptions (discussed below), postpone for 60 days the effective dates of regulations that have been published but have not yet taken effect for the purpose of reviewing questions of fact, law, and policy ""as permitted by applicable law."" To the maximum extent possible, your explanations for postponement should be individualized to the regulation being postponed. In addition, the Administrative Procedure Act generally establishes procedural requirements for agencies promulgating rules, subject to certain exceptions and exemptions. Please consult with your agency's Office of General Counsel as you implement the Freeze Memo and this Memorandum.Second, consider postponing the effective date beyond 60 days where appropriate. If such a postponement is appropriate, seek comment on the extended postponement, in accordance with the FreezeMemo.[2] If your agency takes comment on the initial 60-day postponement, e.g., by issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking, consider using the same action to take comment on an extended postponement. In addition, please consider taking comment on the regulation itself, including about questions of fact, law, and policy that the agency should recognize as it considers whether the regulation raises any substantial questions.Finally, if during your review you determine a regulation raises no substantial question of fact, law, or policy, please provide your Office of lnformation and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) Desk Officer a list of such regulations on which you plan to take no further action no later than two weeks prior to the postponed effective date for those regulations. Alternately, if you determine a regulation raises a substantial question of fact, law, or policy, please notify your OIRA Desk Officer promptly and consider whether you agency should perform additional rulemaking or take other further actions. If your agency determines it should take further actions, please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer in accordance with the Freeze Memo.Actions Related to the Federal Register and OIRASubject to any exceptions, withdraw all regulations that have been sent to the Office of the Federal Register (OFR) but have not yet been published. This will allow review of those regulations as the Freeze Memo envisions. To facilitate such withdrawals, please see an example withdrawal letter in Appendix A.Note that the OFR's specific requirements for the withdrawal of documents depend on whether those documents have been filed for public inspection. Some of those requirements are particularly time sensitive. Specifically, for those regulations that have been filed for public inspection but not published, Chapter 4.3 of the Federal Register Document Drafting Handbook requires the following for withdrawals:If we have filed the document for public inspection, your [Federal Register] Liaison Officer may withdraw it from publication only by submitting a letter requesting the withdrawal .... An official with authority to sign Federal Register documents or the Liaison Officer must sign this letter.The Liaison Officer must e-mail the OFR at fedreg.liaison@nara.gov as soon as possible to confirm that the letter has been sent. In addition:The letter must reach the OFR during regular office hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. ET) before noon on the workday before the document's scheduled publication date. We will not withdraw the document until we receive your letter.Thus, if it has not already done so, your agency should submit withdrawal letters to the OFR as soon as possible.In addition, subject to any exceptions, send no further regulations to the OFR until an agency head appointed or designated by the President after noon on January 20, 2017, reviews and approves the regulations.[3] Also, consistent with the Freeze Memo's direction to comply with applicable Executive Orders (EOs) concerning regulatory management, please continue to follow the process outlined in EO12866 to determine whether any such approved regulation is significant and therefore subject to OIRA review.Finally, consistent with the Freeze Memo's broad scope, and to ensure that OIRA reviews only those regulations that have already been reviewed by the appropriate person at each agency, I am requesting that your agency withdraw any regulations currently at OIRA.ExceptionsThere are two exceptions to the above directions. First, exclude from those actions any regulations ""subject to statutory or judicial deadlines."" These are regulations where performing the otherwise required review actions would endanger compliance with an operative statutory or judicial deadline. For example, agency civil monetary penalty adjustments that were due this month [4] and were not significant regulatory actions under EO 12866 likely fall within this exception. After you have identified such regulations, please contact your OIRA Desk Officer with a list of those regulations as well as a brief explanation of your determination that provides a reference to the statutory or judicial deadline.Second, the Freeze Memo authorizes the Director or Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget to make exceptions from the Freeze Memo's requirements under paragraphs 1-3 ""for emergency situations or other urgent circumstances relating to health, safety, financial, or national security matters, or otherwise."" Please send your OIRA Desk Officer a list of such regulations, if any; the type of regulatory action each regulation is; which paragraphs of the Freeze Memo those regulations should be excepted from; and a brief explanation for each such regulation of the emergency situation or urgent health, safety, financial, national security, or other matter that forms the basis of the requested exception. The Office of Management and Budget will review your justification promptly and provide further guidance.ApplicabilityAs used in this Memorandum, ""regulation"" has the meaning given to ""regulatory action"" in section 3( e) of EO 12866, and also includes any ""guidance document"" as defined in section 3(g) of EO 12866 as it existed when EO 13422 was in effect. In other words, ""regulation"" means:1. [A]ny substantive action by an agency (normally[5] published in the Federal Register) that promulgates or is expected to lead to the promulgation of a final rule or regulation, including notices of inquiry, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and notices of proposed rulemaking, and2. Any agency statement of general applicability and future effect, other than a regulatory action as defined in EO 12866, ""that sets forth a policy on a statutory, regulatory, or technical issue or an interpretation of a statutory or regulatory issue.""If you have any questions about this Memorandum, the Freeze Memo, or the review process, please contact your OIRA Desk Officer.APPENDIX A[AGENCY LETTERHEAD]January [XX], 2017Oliver Potts, DirectorOffice of the Federal Register (F)The National Archives and Records Administration8601 Adelphi RoadCollege Park, MD 20740-600 IDear Mr. Potts:Please withdraw from publication the rule [NAME OF REGULATORY ACTION and RELEVANT IDENTIFYINGINFORMATION], which is currently [on public inspection and] scheduled to publish in the Federal Register on January [YY], 2017.This request is made in compliance with the White House Chief of Staff Memorandum titled Regulatory Freeze Pending Review, signed on January 20 2017, by White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.Sincerely,[SlGN]Type name,Title[1]In accordance with the Freeze Memo, this Memorandum uses a broad definition of ""regulation.""

Purpose. Infrastructure investment strengthens our economic platform, makes America more competitive, creates millions of jobs, increases wages for American workers, and reduces the costs of goods and services for American families and consumers. Too often, infrastructure projects in the United States have been routinely and excessively delayed by agency processes and procedures. These delays have increased project costs and blocked the American people from the full benefits of increased infrastructure investments, which are important to allowing Americans to compete and win on the world economic stage. Federal infrastructure decisions should be accomplished with maximum efficiency and effectiveness, while also respecting property rights and protecting public safety and the environment. To that end, it is the policy of the executive branch to streamline and expedite, in a manner consistent with law, environmental reviews and approvals for all infrastructure projects, especially projects that are a high priority for the Nation, such as improving the U.S. electric grid and telecommunications systems and repairing and upgrading critical port facilities, airports, pipelines, bridges, and highways.Sec. 2. Identification of High Priority Infrastructure Projects. With respect to infrastructure projects for which Federal reviews and approvals are required, upon request by the Governor of a State, or the head of any executive department or agency (agency), or on his or her own initiative, the Chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) shall, within 30 days after a request is made, decide whether an infrastructure project qualifies as a ""high priority"" infrastructure project. This determination shall be made after consideration of the project's importance to the general welfare, value to the Nation, environmental benefits, and such other factors as the Chairman deems relevant.Sec. 3. Deadlines. With respect to any project designated as a high priority under section 2 of this order, the Chairman of the CEQ shall coordinate with the head of the relevant agency to establish, in a manner consistent with law, expedited procedures and deadlines for completion of environmental reviews and approvals for such projects. All agencies shall give highest priority to completing such reviews and approvals by the established deadlines using all necessary and appropriate means. With respect to deadlines established consistent with this section that are not met, the head of the relevant agency shall provide a written explanation to the Chairman explaining the causes for the delay and providing concrete actions taken by the agency to complete such reviews and approvals as expeditiously as possible.Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(c) All actions taken pursuant to this order shall be consistent with requirements and authorities to protect intelligence and law enforcement sources and methods. Nothing in this order shall be interpreted to supersede measures established under authority of law to protect the security and integrity of specific activities and associations that are in direct support of intelligence and law enforcement operations.(d) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.DONALD J.

Only a limited stretch of the project is not yet constructed. Timely review and approval of energy pipelines is critical to a strong economy, energy independence, and national security.Presidential Memorandum Regarding Construction of American PipelinesIn keeping with his commitment to Buy American, Hire American, President Trump directed the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with all relevant executive departments and agencies, to develop a plan under which all new pipelines, as well as retrofitted, repaired, or expanded pipelines, inside the borders of the United States, including portions of pipelines, use materials and equipment produced in the United States, to the maximum extent possible and to the extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall submit the plan to the President within 180 days of the date of this memorandum.Presidential Memorandum Streamlining Permitting and Reducing Regulatory Burdens for Domestic ManufacturingWith this Presidential Memorandum, President Trump helps fulfill the campaign promise of boosting domestic manufacturing by determining a plan of action for expediting approvals for manufacturing and reducing regulatory burdens.Under this Presidential Memorandum, the Secretary of Commerce will conduct outreach to stakeholders and solicit comments from the public concerning Federal actions to streamline permitting and reduce regulatory burdens affecting domestic manufacturers.The Commerce Secretary will submit a report to the President identifying recommendations to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens affecting domestic manufacturers. The report should identify priority actions as well as recommended deadlines for completing actions.Executive Order Expediting Environmental Reviews and Approvals For High Priority Infrastructure ProjectsWith this Executive Order, President Trump will establish a framework for expediting environmental reviews for high priority infrastructure projects.Delays and other inefficiencies in the environmental review and permitting process are severely impeding critically important projects to rebuild and modernize our nations infrastructure, such as highways, bridges, tunnels, the electrical grid, ports, water systems, airports, railways and pipelines.According to one study, our antiquated power rigs wastes the equivalent of 200 coal-fired power plants, water pipes leak trillions of gallons of water, and gridlock on roads and railroads wastes hundreds of billions annually.",19912.71,112.86000000000058,5600.96,48.02000000000044,2280.07,14.870000000000346

17,2017-01-25,Executive Order: Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements,"EXECUTIVE ORDER- - - - - - -BORDER SECURITY AND IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT IMPROVEMENTSBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) (INA), the Secure Fence Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-367) (Secure Fence Act), and the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-208 Div. C) (IIRIRA), and in order to ensure the safety and territorial integrity of the United States as well as to ensure that the Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby order as follows:Section 1. Purpose. Border security is critically important to the national security of the United States. Aliens who illegally enter the United States without inspection or admission present a significant threat to national security and public safety. Such aliens have not been identified or inspected by Federal immigration officers to determine their admissibility to the United States. The recent surge of illegal immigration at the southern border with Mexico has placed a significant strain on Federal resources and overwhelmed agencies charged with border security and immigration enforcement, as well as the local communities into which many of the aliens are placed.Transnational criminal organizations operate sophisticated drug- and human-trafficking networks and smuggling operations on both sides of the southern border, contributing to a significant increase in violent crime and United States deaths from dangerous drugs. Among those who illegally enter are those who seek to harm Americans through acts of terror or criminal conduct. Continued illegal immigration presents a clear and present danger to the interests of the United States.Federal immigration law both imposes the responsibility and provides the means for the Federal Government, in cooperation with border States, to secure the Nation's southern border. Although Federal immigration law provides a robust framework for Federal-State partnership in enforcing our immigration laws - and the Congress has authorized and provided appropriations to secure our borders -the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to deploy all lawful means to secure the Nation's southern border, to prevent further illegal immigration into the United States, and to repatriate illegal aliens swiftly, consistently, and humanely.Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:(a) secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism;(b) detain individuals apprehended on suspicion of violating Federal or State law, including Federal immigration law, pending further proceedings regarding those violations;(c) expedite determinations of apprehended individuals' claims of eligibility to remain in the United States;(d) remove promptly those individuals whose legal claims to remain in the United States have been lawfully rejected, after any appropriate civil or criminal sanctions have been imposed;(e) cooperate fully with States and local law enforcement in enacting Federal-State partnerships to enforce Federal immigration priorities, as well as State monitoring and detention programs that are consistent with Federal law and do not undermine Federal immigration priorities.Sec. 3. Definitions. (a) ""Asylum officer"" has the meaning given the term in section 235(b)(1)(E) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)).(b) ""Southern border"" shall mean the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico, including all points of entry.(c) ""Border States"" shall mean the States of the United States immediately adjacent to the contiguous land border between the United States and Mexico.(d) Except as otherwise noted, ""the Secretary"" shall refer to the Secretary of Homeland Security.(e) ""Wall"" shall mean a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier.(f) ""Executive department"" shall have the meaning given in section 101 of title 5, United States Code.(g) ""Regulations"" shall mean any and all Federal rules, regulations, and directives lawfully promulgated by agencies.(h) ""Operational control"" shall mean the prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States, including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband.Sec. 4. Physical Security of the Southern Border of the United States. The Secretary shall immediately take the following steps to obtain complete operational control, as determined by the Secretary, of the southern border:(a) In accordance with existing law, including the Secure Fence Act and IIRIRA, take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border;(b) Identify and, to the extent permitted by law, allocate all sources of Federal funds for the planning, designing, and constructing of a physical wall along the southern border;(c) Project and develop long-term funding requirements for the wall, including preparing Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years; and(d) Produce a comprehensive study of the security of the southern border, to be completed within 180 days of this order, that shall include the current state of southern border security, all geophysical and topographical aspects of the southern border, the availability of Federal and State resources necessary to achieve complete operational control of the southern border, and a strategy to obtain and maintain complete operational control of the southern border.Sec. 5. Detention Facilities. (a) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately construct, operate, control, or establish contracts to construct, operate, or control facilities to detain aliens at or near the land border with Mexico.(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign asylum officers to immigration detention facilities for the purpose of accepting asylum referrals and conducting credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)) and applicable regulations and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to applicable regulations.(c) The Attorney General shall take all appropriate action and allocate all legally available resources to immediately assign immigration judges to immigration detention facilities operated or controlled by the Secretary, or operated or controlled pursuant to contract by the Secretary, for the purpose of conducting proceedings authorized under title 8, chapter 12, subchapter II, United States Code.Sec. 6. Detention for Illegal Entry. The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate actions to ensure the detention of aliens apprehended for violations of immigration law pending the outcome of their removal proceedings or their removal from the country to the extent permitted by law. The Secretary shall issue new policy guidance to all Department of Homeland Security personnel regarding the appropriate and consistent use of lawful detention authority under the INA, including the termination of the practice commonly known as ""catch and release,"" whereby aliens are routinely released in the United States shortly after their apprehension for violations of immigration law.Sec. 7. Return to Territory. The Secretary shall take appropriate action, consistent with the requirements of section 1232 of title 8, United States Code, to ensure that aliens described in section 235(b)(2)(C) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(2)(C)) are returned to the territory from which they came pending a formal removal proceeding.Sec. 8. Additional Border Patrol Agents. Subject to available appropriations, the Secretary, through the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, shall take all appropriate action to hire 5,000 additional Border Patrol agents, and all appropriate action to ensure that such agents enter on duty and are assigned to duty stations as soon as is practicable.Sec. 9. Foreign Aid Reporting Requirements. The head of each executive department and agency shall identify and quantify all sources of direct and indirect Federal aid or assistance to the Government of Mexico on an annual basis over the past five years, including all bilateral and multilateral development aid, economic assistance, humanitarian aid, and military aid.

Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary shall submit to the President a consolidated report reflecting the levels of such aid and assistance that has been provided annually, over each of the past five years.Sec. 10. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).(b) To the extent permitted by law, and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties.(c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in the manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws and obtaining operational control over the border for that jurisdiction.Sec. 11. Parole, Asylum, and Removal. It is the policy of the executive branch to end the abuse of parole and asylum provisions currently used to prevent the lawful removal of removable aliens.(a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to ensure that the parole and asylum provisions of Federal immigration law are not illegally exploited to prevent the removal of otherwise removable aliens.(b) The Secretary shall take all appropriate action, including by promulgating any appropriate regulations, to ensure that asylum referrals and credible fear determinations pursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1125(b)(1)) and 8 CFR 208.30, and reasonable fear determinations pursuant to 8 CFR 208.31, are conducted in a manner consistent with the plain language of those provisions.(c) Pursuant to section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I) of the INA, the Secretary shall take appropriate action to apply, in his sole and unreviewable discretion, the provisions of section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) and (ii) of the INA to the aliens designated under section 235(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).(d) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to ensure that parole authority under section 212(d)(5) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(5)) is exercised only on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the plain language of the statute, and in all circumstances only when an individual demonstrates urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit derived from such parole.(e) The Secretary shall take appropriate action to require that all Department of Homeland Security personnel are properly trained on the proper application of section 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (8 U.S.C. 1232) and section 462(g)(2) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)(2)), to ensure that unaccompanied alien children are properly processed, receive appropriate care and placement while in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security, and, when appropriate, are safely repatriated in accordance with law.Sec. 12.

18,2017-01-25,Executive Order: Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,"EXECUTIVE ORDER- - - - - - -ENHANCING PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE INTERIOR OF THEUNITED STATESBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), and in order to ensure the public safety of the American people in communities across the United States as well as to ensure that our Nation's immigration laws are faithfully executed, I hereby declare the policy of the executive branch to be, and order, as follows:Section 1. Purpose. Interior enforcement of our Nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States. Many aliens who illegally enter the United States and those who overstay or otherwise violate the terms of their visas present a significant threat to national security and public safety. This is particularly so for aliens who engage in criminal conduct in the United States.Sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States willfully violate Federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States. These jurisdictions have caused immeasurable harm to the American people and to the very fabric of our Republic.Tens of thousands of removable aliens have been released into communities across the country, solely because their home countries refuse to accept their repatriation. Many of these aliens are criminals who have served time in our Federal, State, and local jails. The presence of such individuals in the United States, and the practices of foreign nations that refuse the repatriation of their nationals, are contrary to the national interest.Although Federal immigration law provides a framework for Federal-State partnerships in enforcing our immigration laws to ensure the removal of aliens who have no right to be in the United States, the Federal Government has failed to discharge this basic sovereign responsibility. We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. The purpose of this order is to direct executive departments and agencies (agencies) to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the executive branch to:(a) Ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States, including the INA, against all removablealiens, consistent with Article II, Section 3 of the United States Constitution and section 3331 of title 5, United States Code;(b) Make use of all available systems and resources to ensure the efficient and faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States;(c) Ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable Federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law;(d) Ensure that aliens ordered removed from the United States are promptly removed; and(e) Support victims, and the families of victims, of crimes committed by removable aliens.Sec. 3. Definitions. The terms of this order, where applicable, shall have the meaning provided by section 1101 of title 8, United States Code.Sec. 4. Enforcement of the Immigration Laws in the Interior of the United States. In furtherance of the policy described in section 2 of this order, I hereby direct agencies to employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws of the United States against all removable aliens.Sec. 5. Enforcement Priorities. In executing faithfully the immigration laws of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress in sections 212(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 235, and 237(a)(2) and (4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227(a)(2) and (4)), as well as removable aliens who:(a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense;(b) Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved;(c) Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense;(d) Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency;(e) Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits;(f) Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or(g) In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security.Sec. 6. Civil Fines and Penalties. As soon as practicable, and by no later than one year after the date of this order, the Secretary shall issue guidance and promulgate regulations, where required by law, to ensure the assessment and collection of all fines and penalties that the Secretary is authorized under the law to assess and collect from aliens unlawfully present in the United States and from those who facilitate their presence in the United States.Sec. 7. Additional Enforcement and Removal Officers. The Secretary, through the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, shall, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, take all appropriate action to hire 10,000 additional immigration officers, who shall complete relevant training and be authorized to perform the law enforcement functions described in section 287 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357).Sec. 8. Federal-State Agreements. It is the policy of the executive branch to empower State and local law enforcement agencies across the country to perform the functions of an immigration officer in the interior of the United States to the maximum extent permitted by law.(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Secretary shall immediately take appropriate action to engage with the Governors of the States, as well as local officials, for the purpose of preparing to enter into agreements under section 287(g) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1357(g)).(b) To the extent permitted by law and with the consent of State or local officials, as appropriate, the Secretary shall take appropriate action, through agreements under section 287(g) of the INA, or otherwise, to authorize State and local law enforcement officials, as the Secretary determines are qualified and appropriate, to perform the functions of immigration officers in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States under the direction and the supervision of the Secretary. Such authorization shall be in addition to, rather than in place of, Federal performance of these duties. (c) To the extent permitted by law, the Secretary may structure each agreement under section 287(g) of the INA in a manner that provides the most effective model for enforcing Federal immigration laws for that jurisdiction.Sec. 9. Sanctuary Jurisdictions. It is the policy of the executive branch to ensure, to the fullest extent of the law, that a State, or a political subdivision of a State, shall comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373.(a) In furtherance of this policy, the Attorney General and the Secretary, in their discretion and to the extent consistent with law, shall ensure that jurisdictions that willfully refuse to comply with 8 U.S.C. 1373 (sanctuary jurisdictions) are not eligible to receive Federal grants, except as deemed necessary for law enforcement purposes by the Attorney General or the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to designate, in his discretion and to the extent consistent with law, a jurisdiction as a sanctuary jurisdiction. The Attorney General shall take appropriate enforcement action against any entity that violates 8 U.S.C. 1373, or which has in effect a statute, policy, or practice that prevents or hinders the enforcement of Federal law.(b) To better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions, the Secretary shall utilize the Declined Detainer Outcome Report or its equivalent and, on a weekly basis, make public a comprehensive list of criminal actions committed by aliens and any jurisdiction that ignored or otherwise failed to honor any detainers with respect to such aliens.(c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is directed to obtain and provide relevant and responsive information on all Federal grant money that currently is received by any sanctuary jurisdiction.Sec. 10. Review of Previous Immigration Actions and Policies. (a) The Secretary shall immediately take all appropriate action to terminate the Priority Enforcement Program (PEP) described in the memorandum issued by the Secretary on November 20, 2014, and to reinstitute the immigration program known as ""Secure Communities"" referenced in that memorandum.(b) The Secretary shall review agency regulations, policies, and procedures for consistency with this order and, if required, publish for notice and comment proposed regulations rescinding or revising any regulations inconsistent with this order and shall consider whether to withdraw or modify any inconsistent policies and procedures, as appropriate and consistent with the law.(c) To protect our communities and better facilitate the identification, detention, and removal of criminal aliens within constitutional and statutory parameters, the Secretary shall consolidate and revise any applicable forms to more effectively communicate with recipient law enforcement agencies.Sec. 11. Department of Justice Prosecutions of Immigration Violators. The Attorney General and the Secretary shall work together to develop and implement a program that ensures that adequate resources are devoted to the prosecution of criminal immigration offenses in the United States, and to develop cooperative strategies to reduce violent crime and the reach of transnational criminal organizations into the United States.Sec. 12. Recalcitrant Countries. The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall cooperate to effectively implement the sanctions provided by section 243(d) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1253(d)), as appropriate. The Secretary of State shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, ensure that diplomatic efforts and negotiations with foreign states include as a condition precedent the acceptance by those foreign states of their nationals who are subject to removal from the United States.Sec. 13. Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens. The Secretary shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take all appropriate and lawful action to establish within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens and the family members of such victims. This office shall provide quarterly reports studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.Sec. 14. Privacy Act. Agencies shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, ensure that their privacy policies exclude persons who are not United States citizens or lawful permanent residents from the protections of the Privacy Act regarding personally identifiable information. Sec. 15. Reporting. Except as otherwise provided in this order, the Secretary and the Attorney General shall each submit to the President a report on the progress of the directives contained in this order within 90 days of the date of this order and again within 180 days of the date of this order.Sec. 16.

30,2017-01-27,President Trump and Prime Minister May's Opening Remarks,"President Donald J. Trump: Thank you very much. I am honored to have Prime Minister Theresa May here for our first official visit from a foreign leader. This is our first visit, so -- great honor.The special relationship between our two countries has been one of the great forces in history for justice and for peace. And, by the way, my mother was born in Scotland -- Stornoway -- which is serious Scotland.Today, the United States renews our deep bond with Britain -- military, financial, cultural, and political. We have one of the great bonds. We pledge our lasting support to this most special relationship. Together, America and the United Kingdom are a beacon for prosperity and the rule of law. That is why the United States respects the sovereignty of the British people and their right of self-determination. A free and independent Britain is a blessing to the world, and our relationship has never been stronger.Both America and Britain understand that governments must be responsive to everyday working people, that governments must represent their own citizens.Madam Prime Minister, we look forward to working closely with you as we strengthen our mutual ties in commerce, business and foreign affairs. Great days lie ahead for our two peoples and our two countries.On behalf of our nation, I thank you for joining us here today. Its a really great honor. Thank you very much.Prime Minister Theresa May: Well, thank you very much, Mr. President. And can I start by saying that Im so pleased that Ive been able to be here today. And thank you for inviting me so soon after your inauguration. And Im delighted to be able to congratulate you on what was a stunning election victory.And, as you say, the invitation is an indication of the strength and importance of the special relationship that exists between our two countries -- a relationship based on the bonds of history, of family, kinship and common interest. And in a further sign of the importance of that relationship, I have today been able to convey Her Majesty The Queens hope that President Trump and the First Lady would pay a state visit to the United Kingdom later this year. And Im delighted that the President has accepted that invitation.Now, today, we're discussing a number of topics, and theres much on which we agree. The President has mentioned foreign policy. We're discussing how we can work even more closely together in order to take on and defeat Daesh and the ideology of Islamist extremism wherever its found.Our two nations are already leading efforts to face up to this challenge, and were making progress with Daesh losing territory and fighters, but we need to redouble our efforts. And today, we are discussing how we can do this by deepening intelligence and security cooperation and, critically, by stepping up our efforts to counter Daesh in cyberspace. Because we know we will not eradicate this threat until we defeat the idea -- the ideology that lies behind it.Our talks will be continuing later. Im sure well discuss other topics -- Syria and Russia.On defense and security cooperation, we are united in our recognition of NATO as the bulwark of our collective defense. And today, weve reaffirmed our unshakeable commitment to this alliance. Mr. President, I think you said -- you confirmed that youre 100 percent behind NATO. But were also discussing the importance of NATO continuing to ensure it is as equipped to fight terrorism and cyber warfare as it is to fight more conventional forms of war.And Ive agreed to continue my efforts to encourage my fellow European leaders to deliver on their commitments to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense so that the burden is more fairly shared. Its only by investing properly in our defense that we can ensure were properly equipped to face our shared challenges together.And finally, the President and I have mentioned future economic cooperation and trade. Trade between our two countries is already worth over $150 billion pounds a year. The U.S. is the single-biggest source of inward investment to the UK, and together weve around $1 trillion invested in each others economies. And the UK-U.S. defense relationship is the broadest, deepest, and most advanced of any two countries sharing military hardware and expertise. And I think the President and I are ambitious to build on this relationship in order to grow our respective economies, provide the high-skilled, high-paid jobs of the future for working people across America and across the UK.And so we are discussing how we can establish a trade negotiation agreement, take forward immediate, high-level talks, lay the groundwork for a UK-U.S. trade agreement, and identify the practical steps we can take now in order to enable companies in both countries to trade and do business with one another more easily.And Im convinced that a trade deal between the U.S. and the UK is in the national interest of both countries and will cement the crucial relationship that exists between us, particularly as the UK leaves the European Union and reaches out to the world.Todays talks I think are a significant moment for President Trump and I to build our relationship. And I look forward to continuing to work with you as we deliver on the promises of freedom and prosperity for all the people of our respective countries.",20093.78,-7.130000000001019,5660.78,5.599999999999454,2294.69,-1.9899999999997817

33,2017-01-27,EXECUTIVE ORDER: PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES,"EXECUTIVE ORDER- - - - - - -Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist EntryintotheUnited States By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 etseq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows: Section 1. Purpose. The visa-issuance process plays a crucial role in detecting individuals with terrorist ties and stopping them from entering the United States. Perhaps in no instance was that more apparent than the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when State Department policy prevented consular officers from properly scrutinizing the visa applications of several of the 19 foreign nationals who went on to murder nearly 3,000 Americans. And while the visa-issuance process was reviewed and amended after the September 11 attacks to better detect would-be terrorists from receiving visas, these measures did not stop attacks by foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States. Numerous foreign-born individuals have been convicted or implicated in terrorism-related crimes since September 11, 2001, including foreign nationals who entered the United States after receiving visitor, student, or employment visas, or who entered through the United States refugee resettlement program. Deteriorating conditions in certain countries due to war, strife, disaster, and civil unrest increase the likelihood that terrorists will use any means possible to enter the United States. The United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process to ensure that those approved for admission donot intend to harm Americans and that they have no ties to terrorism. In order to protect Americans, the United States must ensure that those admitted to this country do not bear hostile attitudes toward it and its founding principles. The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. In addition, the United States should not admit those who engage in acts of bigotry or hatred (including ""honor"" killings, other forms of violence against women, or the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own) or those who would oppress Americans of any race, gender, or sexual orientation. Sec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from foreign nationals who intend to commit terrorist attacks in the United States; and to prevent the admission of foreign nationals who intend to exploit United States immigration laws for malevolent purposes. Sec. 3. Suspension of Issuance of Visas and Other Immigration Benefits to Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall immediately conduct a review to determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 30 days of the date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. (c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening of foreign nationals, and to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists or criminals, pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the immigrant and nonimmigrant entry into the United States of aliens from countries referred to in section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and I hereby suspend entry into the United States, as immigrants and nonimmigrants, of such persons for 90 days from the date of this order (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas). (d) Immediately upon receipt of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request all foreign governments that do not supply such information to start providing such information regarding their nationals within 60days of notification. (e) After the 60-day period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion on a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of foreign nationals (excluding those foreign nationals traveling on diplomatic visas, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visas, C-2 visas for travel to the United Nations, and G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4 visas) from countries that do not provide the information requested pursuant to subsection (d) of this section until compliance occurs. (f) At any point after submitting the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment. (g) Notwithstanding a suspension pursuant to subsection (c) of this section or pursuant to a Presidential proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked. (h) The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 30 days of the date of this order, a second report within 60 days of the date of this order, a third report within 90 days of the date of this order, and a fourth report within 120 days of the date of this order. Sec. 4. Implementing Uniform Screening Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall implement a program, as part of the adjudication process for immigration benefits, to identify individuals seeking to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis with the intent to cause harm, or who are at risk of causing harm subsequent to their admission. This program will include the development of a uniform screening standard and procedure, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that the applicant is who the applicant claims to be; a process to evaluate the applicant's likelihood of becoming a positively contributing member of society and the applicant's ability to make contributions to the national interest; and a mechanism to assess whether or not the applicant has the intent to commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United States. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of this directive within 60 days of the date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the date of this order. Sec. 5. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication process to determine what additional procedures should be taken to ensure that those approved for refugee admission do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. Refugee applicants who are already in the USRAP process may be admitted upon the initiation and completion of these revised procedures. Upon the date that is 120 days after the date of this order, the Secretary of State shall resume USRAP admissions only for nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that such additional procedures are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States. (b) Upon the resumption of USRAP admissions, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, is further directed to make changes, to the extent permitted by law, to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality. Where necessary and appropriate, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall recommend legislation to the President that would assist with such prioritization. (c) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of nationals of Syria as refugees is detrimental to the interests of the United States and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest. (d) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any such entry until such time as I determine that additional admissions would be in the national interest. (e) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the admission of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest -- including when the person is a religious minority in his country of nationality facing religious persecution, when admitting the person would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement, or when the person is already in transit and denying admission would cause undue hardship -- and it would not pose a risk to the security or welfare of the United States. (f) The Secretary of State shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the directive in subsection (b) of this section regarding prioritization of claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution within 100 days of the date of this order and shall submit a second report within 200 days of the date of this order. (g) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement. Sec. 6. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretaries of State and Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority in section 212 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182, relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing memoranda. Sec. 7. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry-exit tracking system for all travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. (b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive contained in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the date of this order. Further, the Secretary shall submit a report every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational. Sec. 8. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions. (b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that non-immigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected. Sec. 9. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If a country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by the foreign country, to the extent practicable. Sec. 10. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To bemore transparent with the American people, and to more effectively implement policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available within 180 days, and every 180 days thereafter:(i) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation, or material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national security reasons since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later;(ii) information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including honor killings, in the United States by foreign nationals, since the date of this order or the last reporting period, whichever is later; and(iv) any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses. (b) The Secretary of State shall, within one year of the date of this order, provide a report on the estimated long-term costs of the USRAP at the Federal, State, and local levels. Sec. 11. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals. (b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations. (c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.DONALD J.

35,2017-01-27,March for Life Remarks of Vice President Pence - As Prepared for Delivery,"MARCH FOR LIFEFRIDAY, JANUARY 27, 2017WASHINGTON, D.C.As Prepared for Delivery  On behalf of President Donald Trump, my wife Karen, and our daughter Charlotte, Id like to welcome you all to Washington, D.C. for the 44th annual March for Life.And I am deeply humbled to be the first Vice President of the United States to ever have the privilege to attend this historic gathering.More than two-hundred and forty years ago, our Founders wrote words that have echoed through the ages.They declared these truths to be self-evident. That we are, all of us, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.Forty-four years ago, our Supreme Court turned away from the first of these timeless ideals.But today, three generations hence, because of all of you, and the many more who stand with us in marches just like this across this nation, life is winning in America again.That is evident in the election of pro-life majorities in the Congress of the United States.But it is no more evident than in the historic election of a president who stands for a stronger America, a more prosperous America, and a president who I proudly say stands for the right to life  President Donald Trump.President Trump actually asked me to be here today to thank all of you for your support and for your stand for life and for your compassion for the women and children of this nation.One week ago today, on the steps of the Capitol, we saw the inauguration of the 45th President of the United States. Our President is a man with broad shoulders and a big heart. His vision, his energy, and his optimism are boundless, and I know he will Make America Great Again.From his first day in office, he has been keeping his promises to the American people.And at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, were in the promise-keeping business.Thats why, on Monday President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy to prevent foreign aid from funding organizations that promote or perform abortions.Thats why this administration will work with Congress to end taxpayer funding for abortion and abortion providers, and we will devote those resources to health-care services for women across America.And thats why, next week, President Donald Trump will announce a Supreme Court nominee who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.Life is winning in America. And today is a celebration of the progress that we have made in the cause.You know, I have long believed that a society can be judged by how we care for our most vulnerable  the aged, the infirm, the disabled, and the unborn.Weve come to a historic moment in the cause of life, and we must meet this moment with respect and compassion for every American.Life is winning in America for many reasons.Life is winning through the steady advance of science that illuminates when life begins.Life is winning through the generosity of millions of adoptive families, who open their hearts and homes to children in need.Life is winning through the compassion of caregivers and volunteers at crisis pregnancy centers and faith-based organizations who minister to women, in cities and towns across this country.And life is winning through the quiet counsels between mothers and daughters, grandmothers and granddaughters, between friends across kitchen tables, and over coffee on college campuses the truth is being told and compassion is overcoming convenience, hope is defeating despair.In a word, life is winning in America because of all of you.So I urge you to press on.But as it is written, let your gentleness be evident to all. Let this movement be known for love, not anger  for compassion, not confrontation. When it comes to matters of the heart, theres nothing stronger than gentleness.I believe we will continue to win the hearts and the minds of the rising generation if our hearts first break for young mothers and their unborn children and we do all we can to meet them where they are, with generosity, not judgment.To heal our land and restore a culture of life we must continue to be a movement that embraces all and cares for all out of respect for the dignity and worth of every person.Enshrined on the walls of the Jefferson Memorial are the words of our third president, who admonished us to remember that God who gave us life gave us liberty.On behalf of the President of the United States, and my little family, we thank you for your stand for life, for your compassion, for your love for the women and children of this nation.Be assured, we will not grow weary.

49,2017-01-31,Statement by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:09 P.M. ESTGood afternoon. I know youre all looking forward to what promises to be a historic night for the nation and for this President. The President is very excited to make his announcement of the next Associate Justice to the Supreme Court later this evening.According to some polls -- and you know we love polls around here -- for 70 percent of the voters, the President's choice for Supreme Court was an important factor in their choice at the ballot box in November. For more than one in five, it was the most important factor. Tonight, he will formally present his nominee to the American people, and I can assure you that this individual will make those voters and every American very, very proud.This particular choice is one that the President takes very seriously. He knows it will impact the course of our countrys jurisprudence for generations to come. As such, he's taken careful steps to ensure that this process has both been transparent and inclusive. He has been speaking about the list of individuals that he may nominate since May of this year, and, after consulting with several influential groups, released a definitive list of 21 in September, pledging that his nominee will solely come from that list. He sought the advice and consent of both Republicans and Democrats, senators throughout this process.The President recognizes the gravity of his choice to fill the seat left by Justice Scalia, one of the most steadfast protectors of our liberty and devotees of our Constitution that ever graced the bench. Whomever the President selects will be a worthy successor to the brilliant legal mind and constitutional dedication of Justice Scalia.It's our intention to start promptly tonight in the East Room at 8:02 p.m. Pre-set will begin at 6:30. The East Room will be available for live shots approximately 20 minutes following the announcement, and both the Briefing Room and Pebble Beach outside have extended hours tonight to accommodate any additional journalistic needs. We'll have further guidance on tonights plans as the day evolves.Moving to the news of the day, I know that Secretary Kelly, alongside other DHS officials, just recently concluded a briefing on the operational implementation of the Presidents executive order. I think its pretty clear from the Secretarys press conference that this executive order was enacted with the proper preparation and coordination between the White House and DHS, and that implementation will continue and proceed as planned.We also have a few updates on the leadership of some of our most critical government agencies. Last night, as you know, the President relieved Sally Yates of her duties as acting Attorney General and named Dana Boente, as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, to serve as the acting Attorney General until Democratic senators finally quit their obstruction and confirm the unquestionably qualified Senator Jeff Sessions as our next Attorney General.Ms. Yates failed to enforce a legal order, approved by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel and designed to protect the citizens of the United States. Calling for tougher vetting for individuals traveling from seven nations is not extreme. It is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.Around 9:00 p.m. last night, the President signed an affidavit of nomination for Mr. Boente. As one of his first official actions in his new post as acting Attorney General, he signed a memorandum rescinding Sally Yates guidance regarding the Presidents executive order to ensure its full implementation.Last night, the President also announced the appointment of Thomas Homan as Acting Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security and Director of ICE. Mr. Homan has had a long career at ICE, most recently serving as the Executive Associate Director for Enforcement and Removal Operations. Having a professional in place like this go serve as the acting director is critical to ensuring the efficient administration of the Presidents agenda.One other update on a story from yesterday. I hope you all saw the statement that was put out from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where Chairman Dunford noted -- discussed the reorganization of the National Security Council. And he made it clear that he continues to fully participate in the interagency process and provide the best possible military advice to the President and members of the NSC. I really hope that that statement closes the book on the misleading narrative, and this should hopefully be the final time that we have to address what was in the national security directive.The family of the President -- excuse me, the President also had a very somber and lengthy conversation with the family of [Navy] Chief Petty Officer William Ryan Owens. The President offered his sincerest condolences to Officer Owenss wife, his father, and their three children. Chief Owens was on his 12th deployment, from what I understand. We could never repay the debt of gratitude we owe him, the freedom that he fought for, and the sacrifice that he made, as well as the other members of his unit who were injured in this operation.Today in the Senate, two of the Presidents nominees advanced out of the committee. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved the nominations of both Congressman Ryan Zinke as the next Interior Secretary and the nomination of former Texas Governor Rick Perry as the next Secretary of Energy. Elaine Chao also gratefully received the approval of the full Senate to become the next Secretary of Transportation. I expect further guidance on her official swearing-in to come very soon.The Senate Democrats have done everything in their power to slow the work of the Senate, while the President continues to take decisive action, just like he promised. So it's unfortunate that Senate Democrats remain so out of touch with the message that the American people sent this past November -- that people want change. President Trump is delivering that change, and the only response from Senate Democrats so far is to try to stall the core functions of our government.I know that Ive repeated this every day, but honestly its getting a bit ridiculous. The idea that these highly qualified nominees have the votes for their nominations to be endorsed out of committee and get a full vote are being stalled because Democrats are boycotting the committee vote is outrageous. The mere idea that they're not even showing up to hearings is truly outrageous. So I'd like to give a special shout-out to the folks at C-SPAN for making sure that all of these embarrassing actions by Senate Democrats get the wall-to-wall coverage that they deserve. Voters are going to remember what senators stood in the way of when President Trump -- by President Trump trying to install his agency and department leaders the next time their name is on a ballot.I dont mean to sound like a broken record, but the numbers dont lie. Sixteen of President Trumps nominees to head major department or agencies are still waiting to be confirmed. At the same time in 2009, President Obama only had seven of these people awaiting confirmation. In 2001, President Bush had all but two.Moving on, here at the White House, this morning, we reiterated the Presidents intention to continue to enforce the executive order protecting employees from the anti-LGBTQ discrimination while working for the federal government or contractors.Also this morning, the President had a breakfast and listening session with major pharmaceutical company executives in the Roosevelt Room: Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Celgene, Amgen, Eli Lilly, and the PhRMA trade group were represented at the meeting. Chairman Greg Walden, Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, also participated. During the meeting, the President commended their progress in lowering drugs prices but also reiterated his insistence that there is more work to be done. He promised to continue reducing the burdensome regulations that raise the cost of doing business in America.He was pleased to hear that the Chairman of Amgen, Robert Bradway, discussed how 1,600 American jobs will be added by Amgen. This administration will continue to prioritize jobs and make it easier for businesses around this country to hire more Americans.The President had lunch with Mayor Giuliani just a short time ago, who serves as the CEO of an international security firm, Giuliani Partners, and was tapped by the President to lend his expertise to the administration's cyber efforts. Mayor Giuliani was asked to initiate this process because of his long and very successful government career in law enforcement and his 15 years private sector security, providing solutions for the challenges that we face in the cyber world.During the transition, the President announced that he intended to host a series of meetings with senior corporate executives from companies that are facing challenges, such as hacking, intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of data and identities, and securing information from technological infrastructures. These are the same challenges facing the government that are facing public entities and businesses, and the President believes that solutions to these issues will often come from the private sector.Following the lunch with Mayor Giuliani, the President will host a listening session with these cybersecurity experts and Mayor Giuliani. No consensus or advice on the recommendations resulting from the group are wildly expected, but we do expect a spirited and wide-ranging discussion regarding the growing cybersecurity threats that our nation is facing.Later this afternoon, the President will sign an executive order -- or potentially sign one -- the federal government cybersecurity efforts, and give leaders the tools they need to keep the country safe from cyberattacks.The order does three main things: It secures the federal networks we operate on behalf of the American people. It will work with industry to protect critical infrastructure and maintain our way of life. And it will advance the cause of Internet freedom.More information will be available later this afternoon, but the executive order is the first step in the President taking to address the new security challenges of the 21st century.The Vice President today participated in the Republican Policy lunch today in the Senate. He'll hold several meetings with members on Capitol Hill, the beginning of extensive outreach by our Legislative Affairs team on the Presidents Supreme Court choice.Tonight, the Vice President will swear in Elaine Chao, as I mentioned. We'll have further updates. We expect it to be at 5 o'clock in the ceremonial office across the way, in the Old Executive Office Building.Secretary Chao is one of the most successful Cabinet officials in American history, having been the longest tenured Secretary of Labor since WWII, and also serving as the Deputy Secretary of Transportation under George H.W. Bushs administration. She's the perfect choice to lead the Department of Transportation into what promises to be a significant period of modernization and improvement.As I already mentioned, the last thing on our schedule for tonight is the President's announcement of the next Associate Justice for the Supreme Court.Tomorrow is the kick-off for Black History Month, and the White House is excited to host a series of events this month in recognition of it. In particular, the U.S. Post Office will hold a ceremony tomorrow celebrating the official issuance of the Dorothy Height Forever stamp. Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and is a true pioneer in the Civil Rights Movement.Finally, a couple administrative notes. On Friday, the President will depart from this White House to the ""Winter White House down at Mar-A-Lago, where hell spend the weekend and be holding meetings. Further guidance on both trips will be coming out throughout the week.And Im excited to announce that following up on our announcement of expanding the press briefing room to Skype seats, well officially be launching the briefing room tomorrow. The inaugural panelists will be Natalie Herbick, from Fox 8 in Cleveland, Ohio; Lars Larson of the Lars Larson Show; Jeff Jobe, from Jobe Publishing in South Central Kentucky; and Kimberly Kalunian, from WPRI in Rhode Island. Not sure how she snuck in there. (Laughter.)I look forward to virtually welcoming them to the briefing room. And with that, some questions.John Roberts.Q The removal last night of Ms. Yates from her position has raised questions as to how this President will deal with dissent in the ranks currently and in the future. Does he see what she said yesterday as a difference of opinion, an active insubordination? How would he read it? And how will he act on similar things in the future?MR. SPICER: Well, theres a big difference, John, between listening and sharing ideas, and executing lawful orders. It is the right of every American to express their idea and opinion, and, frankly, thats what youve seen the President do today. Were talking about leaving -- at 2 o'clock hour, him sitting down with cyber experts to get their opinions and ideas on how to protect our critical infrastructures.But theres a difference. When she, as the Acting Attorney General, is not only responsible but required to execute lawful orders and defiantly says ""no,"" as someone who was chosen to lead a department, she was rightfully removed. That is a position of leadership that is given to somebody who is supposed to execute orders that are handed down to them properly, of which that executive order was 100 percent done.Ironically, it went through their offices -- the Department of Justice Office of Legal Compliance. So the idea that it went through the entire process of which they were part of, and then she chooses not to execute it, actually is bewildering as well as defiant.Q So is the President -- so, sorry, can I just follow up on that? So is the President laying down a marker now to all of his Cabinet secretaries and all of his other officials to say, if I give you a directive and you do not follow it, youre gone?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that that kind of comes with the job, right? If you dont believe in the Presidents agenda -- and I think every one of the Cabinet members, every one of the appointees understands that they serve at the pleasure of the President. We talked about this at length during the transition. This isnt about joining the government to execute your ideas or your initiatives. The President was very clear during the campaign, whether it was economic security or national security, that he has an agenda that he articulated very, very clearly to the American people, and that --Q But --MR. SPICER: Hold on. Thank you. And that it is his job to lay that vision out, and that the people that he appoints and nominates and announces as staff members or Cabinet-level members or agency heads, their job is to fulfill that. And if they dont like it, then they shouldnt take the job. But it is the Presidents agenda that we are fulfilling here.Trey.Q Thanks, Sean. As it relates to the executive order today, how will the Trump administration ensure the digital privacy of all Americans as the President looks to strengthen U.S. cybersecurity?MR. SPICER: Well, look, just to be clear on the executive order, I think one of the things that the President -- the reason the President wants Mayor Giuliani and some of these cyber experts to come in is to get their ideas, to make sure that where were headed in cybersecurity is fulfilling the intent that ensures that our critical infrastructures throughout the government and, frankly, throughout business -- to the extent that the government can be helpful in that -- are protected and secured.So I just want to caution what we may or may not do today. I think the President has got a pretty good idea of where hes going to go, but I think he wants to hear what Mayor Giuliani and some of these other experts have to say about the steps that we can take in terms of executive action that will help secure further these critical infrastructures.April.Q Sean, I have a couple of questions. I want to go back to the issue of this travel ban.MR. SPICER: Well, first of all, its not a travel ban. I think you heard Secretary Kelly -- I apologize, I just want to make sure I get this straight. I think Secretary Kelly or one of the other individuals that got up there from DHS mentioned I think a million people have now come into this country. Thats not a ban.What it is, is to make sure that the people who are coming in are vetted properly from seven countries that were identified by the Obama administration. A ban would mean people cant get in. Weve clearly seen hundreds of thousands of people come into our country from other countries. Sorry. Go ahead.Q Okay. But mind you, I have two questions. (Laughter.)MR. SPICER: I know, of course.Q So with all of this happening, and as youre trying to give specifics about whats happening, what is the concern about the fallout from other countries who are viewing this still in a certain way? Have you looked at the fallout and how to counter it, and how to work with these other countries that may be allies, or even may not be allies, in order to prevent something from happening?MR. SPICER: Well, I think, April, one of the things that were doing is trying to make sure that people understand what actually happened. I saw reporting today that Secretary Kelly was out of the loop and he was on a plane and flying, and then it was reported on one of the networks and major institutions about what happened. And Secretary Kelly comes out and says, I was briefed on this time, I was talked on this time, the edits came from my staff. I dont know how -- I dont want to spend each of these briefings talking about misinformation, but at the end of the day, a major newspaper and a major network reported today that they were kept out of the loop. The Secretary detailed multiple occasions in which he was briefed on it. His staff made edits to it.I dont know how much more -- and so I think part of what were trying to do is make sure that people actually understand what happened, what the process was, and what the order actually does. Because when we use words like travel ban, that misrepresents what it is. Its seven countries previously identified by the Obama administration where, frankly, we dont get the information that we need for people coming into this country.Because what this isnt about is not just the people. Its about the information that another country provides us. So we work with other countries, and we have systems in place to ensure that when you travel from our country to their -- or from their country to our country or vice versa, that we are sharing information about passengers and citizens that are going in and out.These seven countries in particular, we dont have the information that is necessarily required to make an accurate determination at the time of entry into our country. So we are going to make sure that because that country doesnt have maybe either the systems in place or, in some cases, the willingness to provide us the information necessary to ensure that the people that are coming into this country are properly vetted.This isnt about refugees, its about travelers. And thats what this is about.And so part of what were doing is, frankly, making sure that other countries understand exactly what was in the order, how it, how it applies, what it means to visas and waivers and all this kind of stuff. But for the most part, you've seen a lot of panic, and the people actually stopping, reading the order, and realizing, ""oh, that's it?""And I think that's what we've tried to make sure that people have the facts.Q So you're doing outreach for that?MR. SPICER: We're doing -- we're not just doing outreach. I think we're doing as many briefings -- Secretary Kelly going out there a little while ago with the head of both ICE and CBP is trying to make sure that people understand that the process is working correctly -- its working very well -- that the government is doing what its supposed to, to protect its people. And that's the number one thing that we can do.Yeah.Q One other -- you said, two.MR. SPICER: Im sorry. You're right.Q Now, the President met with the pharmaceutical heads.MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q When is this meeting scheduled for Congressman Elijah Cummings and President Trump, after that call that President Trump made --MR. SPICER: Right. My understanding is that Congressman Cummings was -- he was invited to this meeting. He had a scheduling conflict, and we're looking at setting it back up. But he was invited to the meeting today. He informed us he had a scheduling conflict. And we're looking to get it back on the books as soon as we can.Q Would it be one on one? Not --MR. SPICER: I expect at this point it will be one on one.Q Thanks, a lot, Sean. Does the President anticipate a difficult confirmation fight for his nominee, whoever that is?MR. SPICER: No. I think we've proven so far that the Democrats can try to obstruct, but at the end of the day, the will of the American people is going to overcome that.And again, what I mentioned at the outset of this is the advice and consent piece of this. He and our team have met with senators from both sides of the aisle to make sure that we understand the qualities that they are looking for in the next associate justice. And I think that we have done a very, very good job of getting a nominee in place that will be announced tonight that meets the criteria that they set forth. They may not like their political or philosophical background, but I think the criteria in terms of academia background, time on the bench, the expertise and criteria meets the intent of both Republicans and Democrats.John Gizzi.Q Do you believe you can get nine Democrats to support this nominee?MR. SPICER: I do. Absolutely. Because I think at the end of the day, one of the things that's been a time-honored tradition in this country is that we recognize that the confirmation process is -- the default is that if you're qualified for the position, then you should be confirmed. Not the other around.And I think that most Democrats realize that at some point that is -- having a court that is not fully operational is not the political fight to have.John Gizzi.Q Sean, let me ask you the obvious follow-up question then. At least one Republican senator has said Democrats have removed the filibuster from just about every other appointment, aside from the Supreme Court. And he said several Republicans say they would have no hesitation about moving for another nuclear option if Democrats attempt a filibuster of any of the possible nominees. Is this something the President would support? And has he discussed it with members of the Senate?MR. SPICER: Well, I think first and foremost taking a step to the last question, I think we're going to get the nine senators regardless, and I wouldnt be surprised if we get more. When you look -- and Ill be able to shed more light on this tomorrow in terms of the background. But I think that he is -- we've got an individual that I think is hopefully going to garner widespread bipartisan support because I think this individual has the qualifications and the experience and the judicial philosophy that should win bipartisan support.That being said, beyond that, I would suggest that that's -- Senator McConnell has done a phenomenal job of moving things along in the Senate to the extent that Democrats will let him. And I'll leave any further questions on how the Senate operates to him.Blake.Q Sean, thanks. We know that the list of 21 was put out during the campaign. We know that, at 8:02 tonight, the President is going to reveal his selection. Can you kind of fill the gap in between as to how often the President might have spoken with this person, whether there were any meetings here at the White House, just any of the -- how he got there? And then the last hours -- (laughter) -- or in the last days here, really, who has he leaned on to kind of narrow this down? And then a follow-up, if you dont mind.MR. SPICER: I will say, I think I can probably shed a lot more light on this tomorrow. I appreciate the effort to try to head that off. Tomorrow I think we might be able to have a little bit more of a discussion as to how the President came to this choice. He may touch on it a little tonight; I'll leave it to him. But I appreciate that.Q Let me ask you about the news of the day. Prescription drug prices -- the President met with the pharma leaders earlier today. What makes him so confident that he can drive down drug prices, whereas administrations past have tried to do the same but haven't been able to? How is he going to go about it?MR. SPICER: Well, I think it's the story of his entire administration. He's a successful businessman and a top-notch negotiator. Several people tried to get the cost of planes down, the cost of the F-35 and the cost of the Air Force One. And through a couple of conversations, he did it -- shaved billions off of the cost of both -- excuse me, off the F-35 and significant off the next generation of Air Force One.I think he has a track record so far just during the transition, but also as a businessman -- he knows how to negotiate. And I think he is going to sit down with these individuals the same way that he's getting people to understand the agenda and the regulatory and tax climate that he wants to institute that's bringing jobs home. People are making a commitment to him to bring jobs and manufacturing back based on his track record as a businessman and his word. They understand that he's going to create a climate that supports the American worker and American manufacturing.So I think -- you look over and over again, the number of companies that want to come back and say, we want to be part of this agenda to grow the economy and to create jobs or to help you fight on behalf of taxpayers, and I think you're going to continue to see that.He understands the challenges that the bureaucracy that's holding back some of the negotiating, that's allowing these prescription drug prices to drop or get the best deal for the government in cases whether it's Medicare or Medicaid, who are such large buyers of the VA -- that you're not -- you have got such purchasing power that's not being utilized to the full extent.Hunter Walker.Q Thank you, Sean. The President is meeting with Mayor Giuliani today. What do you think of the mayor's claim that the executive order on those seven countries evolved from the Muslim ban that the President proposed during the campaign? Is that accurate?MR. SPICER: I think the President has talked about extreme vetting and the need to keep America safe for a very, very long time. At the same time, he's also made very clear that this is not a Muslim ban. It's not a travel ban. It's a vetting system to keep America safe -- that's it, plain and simple. And all of the facts and a reading of it clearly show that that's what it is.Q Mayor Giuliani stressed that too, but he said that it came out of the desire to have a Muslim ban.MR. SPICER: Then you should ask Mayor Giuliani. That's his opinion. I'm just telling you what the President has said and what the President has done has been to focus on making sure that we keep the country safe and that the executive order that was drafted does just that -- is to make sure and to ensure that people coming in from seven countries, identified by the Obama administration, that we didn't have the proper systems to know who was coming into our country was put in place, and a 90-day period was also granted to ensure that we knew how to further address vetting situations in the future.Zeke.Q Thanks, Sean. Just following up again about the strike over the weekend in Yemen. Can you confirm that the eight-year-old -- the reports that the eight-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in that strike? And if you can address sort of the killing of the American citizen in this anti-terrorism operation.MR. SPICER: I'm not going to go any further than what the Department of Defense has released. Obviously, we recovered a tremendous amount of information, and we killed an estimated 14 members of al Qaeda in -- AQAP individuals. And then we suffered the loss of life of a servicemember, and four people were injured. That's as far as I'm willing to go at this time.Kristen.Q Sean, thanks. You're saying it's not a ban. This was President Trump's tweet yesterday: ""If the ban were announced with a one-week notice, the 'bad' would rush into our country during that week."" So he says it's a ban.MR. SPICER: He's using the words that the media is using. But at the end of the day, it can't --Q Those are his words.Q Wait a minute.MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on, hold on. It can't be --Q That's his words, his tweet.MR. SPICER: Jonathan, thanks, I'll let Kristen talk. It can't be a ban if you're letting a million people in. If 325,000 people from another country can't come in, that is by nature not a ban -- it is extreme vetting.Q I understand your point. But the President himself called it a ban.MR. SPICER: I understand that.Q Is he confused or are you confused?MR. SPICER: No, I'm not confused. I think that the words that are being used to describe it are derived from what the media is calling this. He has been very clear that it is extreme vetting.Q It seems to fit into this broader point, Sean, which Paul Ryan said today: ""I think it's regrettable that there was some confusion on the rollout of this."" The House Speaker saying that. What do you say to Republicans who argue that this is a part of a broader issue with the President not enacting this policy smoothly?MR. SPICER: Well, first of all, I think we've addressed that -- that we could have either telegraphed this days in advance, in which people could have gotten on planes and come over here, which would have undermined the exact nature of what this sought to prevent. Or we could have done it in a way that inconvenienced some folks for a little while --Q But do you dispute that there was confusion --MR. SPICER: Can I answer the -- no, no, I do -- theres clearly some confusion. But I think part of it, your network was one of the people that just hours ago told people that General Kelly was unaware of whats going on. And then moments later he gets on air saying, heres how many times I got briefed. So, I mean, with all due respect, I think you have been part of the confusion. You have helped cause this, despite claims that whatever. You claim that you have sources that tell us. General Kelly stands up and says, this is how many times Ive been briefed, this is how many people were involved. And yet you were out there for --Q I think there was a New York Times report that was cited --MR. SPICER: Oh, okay, so I apologize if NBC Newss reporting is based on The New York Timess false reporting.Q It was accurate reporting, Sean.MR. SPICER: How can it be accurate reporting, Glenn, if --Q Both things can be true.Q It was accurate reporting, Sean.MR. SPICER: Okay, so the --Q They can be true that he --MR. SPICER: The Secretary of Homeland Security just stood up, and so you're calling him a liar?Q He didn't say he saw the specifics of the --MR. SPICER: Jonathan, Im talking to Glenn. Im talking to Glenn.Q No one is calling anyone a liar. Im saying we --MR. SPICER: You said that the report in the New York Times said that he was unaware of the ban.Q Sean, let me ask you a question.MR. SPICER: Hold on. No, no, answer the question. Because you just called this --Q So a couple of minutes ago you stood at the podium and you reiterated something you said yesterday about anyone who doesn't agree in terms of career bureaucracy should hit the road. Im paraphrasing. You had a statement that President Trump made where he accused the acting Attorney General of betraying her own department by expressing a counter opinion. Don't you think that kind of language has a chilling effect on the public statements that your officials make?MR. SPICER: No, I think theres a big difference. Think about the process that worked it here. The Department of Justices Office of Legal Compliance vetted the executive order, sent it back to us saying it was completely compliant. Then the acting Attorney General goes out and says, Im not going to enforce it. You tell me how that jives. Because at the end of the day, if the action Attorney General has an office under her jurisdiction that says that something is legal and compliant, and then she gets out there and says, Im not going to enforce it, that doesn't sound like an Attorney General that is upholding the duty that she swore to uphold.Q Well, if she think it's illegal --MR. SPICER: At the end of the day -- then she should step down. But at the end of the day, the Attorney General either had a problem with her own division approving something. But it wasnt the President she had a problem with. The President followed the process, sought feedback, went through the inter-agency review, had other departments sign off, despite the reporting that said it was otherwise.Q But is this a betrayal, though?MR. SPICER: Hold on. Guys --Q Is it a betrayal?MR. SPICER: David.Q That's a very hard word.MR. SPICER: Why don't we just let me answer Glenn so we can be polite now, huh?And what the answer is, is that we went through the process. The Office of Legal Compliance came back and said, this is a compliant executive order, its fully legal, and it can be executed.So then for the Attorney General to turn around and say, Im not going to uphold this lawful executive order is clearly a dereliction of duty. And she should have been removed, and she was. I just -- it is odd to me that we're having a discussion about somebody whose job it is to execute lawful orders who chose not to do it -- hold on -- who chose not to do it, and then we're questioning whether or not we were right to remove her. That's the right thing to do.And if you looked at the folks from the right and the left, constitutional scholars this morning -- they said, we might not agree with some of the policies or the political -- or the party of the President, but he was right to do this. He had every right --Q So why use the word betrayal --MR. SPICER: Because the departments job is to execute. They're the Department of Justice. And if you have a legally executed order and the Attorney General says, Im not going to execute it, that truly -- that clearly is a betrayal of what shes --Q Lets define the word ""betrayal.""MR. SPICER: Im not going to define the word, Glenn.Yes.Q Sean, I think the New York Times report said that the Secretary did not receive a full briefing until the executive order was being signed. So my question is, can we expect that secretaries, agency heads, when there are future executive orders or changes of policy, may not receive full briefings before --MR. SPICER: Look, the Secretary was briefed on multiple occasions with the language of the order. I don't know how you can say this any other way.Q Well, I'm just talking about a full briefing, which is what the New York Times reported.MR. SPICER: And Im telling you that I don't believe the New York Times reporting is accurate. What Im telling you is that the Secretary on multiple occasions was briefed, his senior officials were briefed -- not just briefed; they were part of the drafting process. It went through -- not only that. Just back up. So they get consulted and briefed. It goes through the Office of Legal Compliance. Then it gets shipped out to the NSC and the Homeland Security Council. This went through a very, very extensive staffing process.So the idea that you can talk whether or not he got fully briefed or -- he was briefed multiple times, saw the language. His staff made edits. It came back multiple times. Im not sure how much more briefing you can do.Q Thank you, Sean. Zoe Daniel, from Australian Broadcasting. Thanks for taking the question. The Australian government made a recent deal with the Obama administration whereby the U.S. would take refugees from Australias offshore detention centers. Now most of these people are from Iran, but also some are from Iraq and Somalia, among other places. Can you confirm that this deal is still on? Are those refugees exempt from what you describe as the extreme vetting? Or will that deal change or be delayed?MR. SPICER: So the deal specifically deals with 1,250 people. They're mostly in Papua New Guinea, being held. Those people -- part of the deal is that they have to be vetted in the same manner that we're doing now. There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them. That is part and parcel of the deal that was made. And it was made by the Obama administration with the full backing of the United States government.The President, in accordance with that deal to honor what had been agreed upon by the United States government, and in ensuring that that vetting will take place in the same manner that we're doing it now, will go forward.Yes.Q The big question -- looking at the bigger picture -- this President, when he came in, said he was going to gather us all together, that he was going to bring us together. And the actions taken in the first 10 days seem to indicate otherwise from people in his own party -- the use of the word betrayal. How is this President going to address the fact that people are looking to him to bring people together, and yet with his own words seems to be driving us apart?MR. SPICER: I think that's a very one-sided way of looking at this. I think hes brought --Q Elaborate.MR. SPICER: I will. I think hes brought unions together, business leaders together, Republicans, Democrats, independents. I think someone who doesn't carry out an act and using that as a way to describe that hes not bringing the country together is not exactly a representation.Q I have one quick follow-up.MR. SPICER: Hold on. I don't -- Im not -- the President has done a tremendous amount through both what he has said and done, more importantly, to start to bring this country together. And his policies, frankly, are focused on keeping every American safe and getting every American a higher-paying and better-paying job. I think that is something that benefits all of us.Q The follow-up -- I asked you about a shield law for journalists last week. You said you would get with this?Q If I could just --MR. SPICER: Hold on.Q -- ask real quick on trade. Now that notices have been given to the TPP countries, are you considering any changes in the roles of your three sort of official trade negotiators? And what area of the globe are you going to start first on negotiations?MR. SPICER: Well, there's no change in their roles. I'm not entirely sure. I think they -- as announced --Q (Inaudible) negotiator --MR. SPICER: He is the U.S. -- I mean, he's got to be confirmed first, but the U.S. trade representative is clearly the leader of negotiating trade deals. Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro and Jason Greenblatt -- there's a great, unbelievably robust, brilliant team that has continued to work on behalf of deals and renegotiating, looking at them. So it's a two-step process.I think, number one, we're going to reexamine all of the current trade deals, figure out if we can re-improve them. But secondly, I think we're going to start talking to other countries around the globe, including some of those TPP partners. I think of the 11 other countries, five of them we have current trade deals with. So you would examine those to see if we can improve upon them and then look at the other countries in there and see if there's a willingness to engage with some of those other countries.Q Sean, the President has previously indicated that he would encourage the targeting of families of terror suspects. Is that still his current position?MR. SPICER: When did he say that?Q December 3rd, on Fox. He said, ""The other thing with [the] terrorists is you have to take out their families."" Is that still his position?MR. SPICER: I think he's been very clear that when it comes to seeking out ISIS and other terrorists, that he's going to lean on Director Pompeo, General Mattis, and seek their opinion on stuff. And I think that will be continued.Sarah.Q Even the families of terror suspects, civilian members of families, Sean?MR. SPICER: Thank you. Rebecca.Q On Guantanamo, Sean. Thanks for taking this question. I know that you've indicated at that podium that there will be further action. What does this look like? And there are five detainees that have been cleared for transfer that are sitting at Guantanamo. Would this administration take action in the next coming months on those detainees?MR. SPICER: I think all of those actions are being currently reviewed, and we don't have anything further at this time.Q The Obama administration's endangerment finding undergirds the Clean Power Plan. Does the President still plan to revoke the Clean Power Plan? And would he perhaps even go further and try and revoke the endangerment finding?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the President has made very clear with respect to energy policy that he wants to review all of the options that we have to use our natural resources to better the country in terms of wind power, solar, clean coal. We're in the process of reviewing all of our energy policies. I'd go back to note that we don't have an Energy Secretary confirmed right now because the Senate hasn't yet moved forward with that. I hope that once that's done, we will have further updates on energy.Matt.Q Sean, Sally Yates was obviously an Obama appointee, was holding it through the transition. How many more of them are there throughout the government at this time, as the transition and confirmation process plays out? And do you expect any more problems from any of the other ones?MR. SPICER: In some cases, weve held some individuals over because they hold a critical position within government. In some cases, weve named folks as acting. Its a case-by-case basis. And again, I think part of it right now is the President wanted to focus on getting his Cabinet up and complete. Well continue to make nominations both at the deputy, under and assistant secretary-level.But in key agencies -- so, ICE being one of them, where its an assistant secretary. But there are 30 other agencies where weve named acting heads to ensure that as we move through the confirmation process, we have somebody in that position to ensure continuity of government.Daniel.Q Sean, yesterday you said 109 individuals were affected by this extreme vetting.MR. SPICER: Right.Q DHS officials said that it was over 1,100.MR. SPICER: No, no, no, hold on. First of all, just to be clear, what theyre talking about is the number of people who werent allowed to board a plane coming in. So they were stopped at their port of entry, had to get additional clearance, and then take off. Theres a big difference. The numbers that were talking about were the initial group of people that were in transit at the time the executive order was signed.And then theres another group of people -- and the Department of Homeland Security has those numbers up to date on their website -- where theyre talking about people that are stopped at the port of entry to ensure that theyre properly vetted before they board a plane. Theres a very, very delicate distinction between people who were on the plane coming into this country when the executive order was signed, all of who have been vetted and cleared, and the people who have been stopped at a port of entry in one of those seven countries to ensure that the proper vetting took place before they were able to move on.Q Sean, Hallies question was about civilians that are being targeted by the administration in anti-terror raids. And Zekes question was about al-Awlakis daughter. So let me ask you: Is the President willing to kill and target American citizens, even minors, just because their family members are terrorists?MR. SPICER: No American citizen will ever be targeted.Q One more follow-up there. If youre qualified for the position -- you said earlier, if youre qualified for the position, you should get confirmed. Thats not how Merrick Garland was treated in the previous administration.MR. SPICER: No, theres never been a situation in which you had a fourth-term -- someone that late in an election cycle. That had never occurred before. And I think that the Senate Republicans were very clear that we should wait and let the voters have a choice, and thats exactly what happened.As I noted at the beginning of this, 70 percent of people thought that the Presidents choice for the next Supreme Court was a major decision. That was something he campaigned on. I think when youre that late in a term -- it had never happened before. And the goal was to make sure that the voters had a say in allowing that to happen. And I think that, clearly, it worked. The voters looked at that as a major reason in which they voted for the President. And I think that as we move forward, thats why I think were going to get the support we need.Q Sean, if the President does get his pick on the bench, what are any specific cases that the administration hopes that the Court takes up in the near futureMR. SPICER: Well, theres a lot of cases that I think are in the queue right now that have the potential to be 4-4. I think the idea is to get this individual confirmed as soon as possible just to get the docket moving. Thats probably the biggest priority right now.Thank you guys very much. Have a great day. Ill see you tonight. Good luck. Eight o'clock.END - 1:50 P.M. EST",19864.09,-107.04000000000087,5614.79,1.0799999999999272,2278.87,-2.0300000000002

This memorandum provides additional guidance regarding the freeze on the hiring of Federal civilian employees as directed by the President on January 23, 2017, via Presidential Memorandum (PM) entitled ""Hiring Freeze."" This guidance is in addition to the initial implementation guidance issued by the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on January 25, 2017. This guidance provides information on the types of exemptions authorized under this hiring freeze as well as instructions on how departments and agencies can request exemptions from the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for critical situations where additional exemptions may be warranted.Coverage. This memorandum applies to all Executive departments and agencies regardless of the sources of their operational and programmatic funding and to all types of Federal civilian appointments, regardless of the length of the appointment, except as provided for below or otherwise provided in law. No vacant positions existing at noon on January 22, 2017, may be filled and no new positions may be created, except in limited circumstances. For the purposes of this memorandum, a position is not considered vacant if an individual has been given an offer of employment prior to noon on January 22, 2017, has accepted the position, and has a designated start date on or before February 22, 2017.Contracting outside the Government to circumvent the intent of the PM shall not be permitted. For example, agencies shall not acquire by contract with a commercial vendor services that are substantially similar to those that would have been provided by a Federal civilian in a vacancy covered by the PM. However, nothing in this memorandum is intended to restrict agencies from continuing, modifying, or entering into service contracts for other purposes, consistent with law, regulation, and any applicable management direction.The guidance in this memorandum should be implemented consistent with any lawful collective bargaining obligations that may apply.Exemptions. The following exemptions to the Federal civilian hiring freeze are permitted:Military personnel in the armed forces and all Federal uniformed personnel, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, and the Commissioned Officer Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Filling of positions under programs where limiting the hiring of personnel would conflict with applicable law.Nomination and appointment of officials to positions requiring Presidential appointment, with or without Senate confirmation.Appointment of officials to non-career positions in the Senior Executive Service or to Schedule C appointments in the Excepted Service, or the appointment of any other officials who serve at the pleasure of the appointing authority (i.e., ""appointed"" positions of a political/non-career nature).Appointment of seasonal employees and short-term temporary employees necessary to meet traditionally recurring seasonal workloads, provided that the agency informs its OMB Resource Management Office in writing in advance of its hiring plans.Hiring by the U.S. Postal Service.Federal civilian personnel hires made by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).Appointments made under the Pathways Internship and Presidential Management Fellows programs (this does not include the Recent Graduates program). Agencies should ensure that such hires understand the provisional nature of these appointments and that conversion is not guaranteed.Conversions in the ordinary course to the competitive service of current agency employees serving in positions with conversion authority, such as Veteran's Recruitment Act (VRA) and Pathways programs.Appointments made under 5 C.F.R.  213.3102(r) (time limited positions in support of fellowship or professional/industry exchange programs) provided that the total number of individuals employed under this authority does not exceed the number of employees onboard (hired under this authority) on January 22, 2017.Placement of persons with restoration rights accorded by law, such as restoration after absence with injury compensation and restoration after military duty.Job offers made prior to January 22, 2017, for which the individual has a confirmed start date on or before February 22, 2017. Those individuals should report to work according to their respective designated start dates.Job offers made prior to January 22, 2017, but for which the individual has a confirmed start date that is later than February 22, 2017 (or does not have a confirmed start date), should be decided on a case-by-case basis and must go through an agency-head review. The agency head should review each position to determine whether the job offer should be revoked, or whether the hiring process should continue. Agency heads should consider essential mission priorities, current agency resources, and funding levels when making determinations about whether or not to revoke job offers.Internal career ladder promotions.Reallocations (i.e., noncompetitive reassignments and details) of current Federal civilian employees within an agency to meet the highest priority needs (including preservation of national security and other essential services) are not affected. Details (reimbursable and non-reimbursable) between agencies are also not affected; however, agency leadership should ensure that any reimbursable details between agencies are not being used to circumvent the intent of the hiring freeze.Term and temporary appointments of existing Federal employees may be extended up to the maximum allowable time limit, consistent with the conditions/requirements of the legal authority originally used to appoint the employee.A limited number of voluntary transfers of current SES between agencies, as necessary to secure the leadership capacity of agencies, and where needs cannot be met by reallocation of resources within an agency's current workforce; however, filling of such vacancies is subject to OPM approval in accordance with section 4 below.The head of any agency may exempt any positions that it deems necessary to:Meet national security (including foreign relations) responsibilities, orMeet public safety responsibilities (including essential activities to the extent that they protect life and property). Agencies may refer to longstanding guidance, which provides examples of such activities inOMB Memorandum. Agency Operations in the Absence of Appropriations. dated 11/17/1981 [see examples 3(a) to 3(k)].Agency heads should consult with appropriate personnel, including the agency Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO) or equivalent and agency counsel when determining what positions to exempt from the hiring freeze. Agency heads are also required to consult with OPM and the agency's OMB Resource Management Office on their intent to exempt positions using their agency head authority before implementing these exemptions. Note that in the case of an Inspector General's (IG) office, the Inspector General is considered the agency head for the purposes of determining which positions in the IG office are exempt based on the definitions above, as well as for the purposes of the agency-head review of job offers in the IG office that either do not have a start date or have a designated start date beyond February 22, 2017.Exemptions Granted by the Director of OPM. The Director of OPM may grant additional exemptions from the hiring freeze for critical situations. Accordingly, if an agency head assesses that circumstances warrant additional exemptions to the hiring freeze other than those specified above, a request must be made in writing to the Director of OPM and signed by the agency head. The request must:Explain the critical need and how it relates to essential services or critical mission requirements.Explain why reallocation (reassignment/detail) of existing staff within the agency is not possible to meet the needs outlined in the request.Explain the urgency of the need and the consequences of not filling the position within a 3 to 6 month timeline.Agencies must also notify their respective OMB Resource Management Office of exemption requests to OPM under this provision.Effective Dates. The guidance in this memorandum is effective immediately. Within 90 days of the publication of the PM issued on January 23, 2017, the Director of OMB, in consultation with the Director of OPM, shall recommend a long-term plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government's workforce through attrition. The hiring freeze will expire upon implementation of the OMB plan.Inquiries. Questions from departments and agencies regarding the instructions and guidance in this memorandum should be addressed to agency OMB Resource Management Officers and OPM contacts provided to Chief Human Capital Officers and HR Directors.",19864.09,-107.04000000000087,5614.79,1.0799999999999272,2278.87,-2.0300000000002

Ryan, a great man.Secretary Tillerson, I first want to congratulate you, Renda, and your entire family on this incredible honor -- and it is that, an incredible honor. You bring the unique skills and deep, deep insights -- and Ive gotten to see it firsthand -- into foreign diplomacy our nation needs to foster stability and security in a world too often trapped -- and right now its trapped -- in violence and in war. You understand that the job of our diplomats and the mission of the State Department is to serve the interests of the United States of America to make our nation safer, our country more prosperous, and our people much more secure. In that mission, you also understand the importance of strengthening our alliances and forming new alliances to enhance our strategic interests and the safety of our people. Your whole life has prepared you for this moment, and you really have had a tremendous life -- heading up one of the great companies of the world and doing it magnificently, absolutely magnificently. And I can say this is a man thats respected all over the world, before he even begins. But as Renda said, now hes beginning his big, big, and most important journey. This is where you were meant to be, right here, today, at this crossroads in history. Its time to bring a clear-eyed focus to foreign affairs, to take a fresh look at the world around us, and to seek new solutions grounded in very ancient truths. These truths include the fact that nations have a right to protect to their interests, that all people have a right to freely pursue their own destiny, and that all of us are better off when we act in concert and not in conflict. And theres rarely been conflict like we have in the world today -- very sad.I am excited for you. I am excited for your family. And perhaps most importantly, I am excited for our great country. Though you inherit enormous challenges in the Middle East and around the world, I do believe we can achieve peace and stability in these very, very troubled times. May God bless you in this journey.

Res. 37  Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Defense, the GeneralServices Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Relatingto the Federal Acquisition Regulation(Rep. Foxx, R-NC, and 3 cosponsors)The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations imposed on Americas businesses. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act have established burdensome compliance requirements that force jobs out of our communities and discourage doing business in the United States. The House is also considering overturning a Social Security Administration Rule that would prevent some Americans with disabilities from purchasing or possessing firearms based on their decision to seek Social Security benefits.H.J. Res. 38 would nullify the Stream Protection Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. 93066 (Dec. 20, 2016), a final rule recently promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. The bill disapproves a rule that would establish onerous requirements for coal mining operations, and impose significant compliance burdens on Americas coal production. The disapproved rule also duplicates existing protections in the Clean Water Act and is unnecessary given the other Federal and State regulations already in place. The Administration is committed to reviving Americas coal mining communities, which have been hurting for too long.H.J. Res. 36 would nullify the final rule Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation. 81 Fed. Reg. 83008 (Nov. 18, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management. The bill disapproves an expensive rule that would require oil and gas producers to reduce natural gas waste and emissions, regardless of whether or not it is economically viable to do so. The majority of affected oil and gas operators are small businesses, and productive wells could be unnecessarily shut in to meet the requirements of this rule. While minimizing waste remains an important component of responsible energy development, the Administration is committed to reducing regulatory burdens on American businesses, supporting energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans, maximizing the use of American resources, and freeing us from dependence on foreign oil.H.J. Res. 41 would nullify the final rule Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers, 81 Fed. Reg. 49359 (July 27, 2016), promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The bill disapproves a rule that would require resource extraction issuers to report payments made to governments for the commercial development of oil, natural gas or minerals. In some cases, the rule would require companies to disclose information that the host nation of their project prohibits from disclosure or is commercially sensitive. The rule would impose unreasonable compliance costs on American energy companies that are not justified by quantifiable benefits. Moreover, American businesses could face a competitive disadvantage in cases where their foreign competitors are not subject to similar rules.H.J. Res. 40 would nullify the final rule Implementation of theNICSImprovement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 Fed. Reg. 91702 (Dec. 19, 2016), promulgated by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The bill disapproves a rule that would allow SSA to provide records on certain individuals who receive Disability Insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act or Supplemental Security Income payments under title XVI of the Social Security Act to the Attorney General for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The rule would prevent some Americans with disabilities from purchasing or possessing firearms based on their decision to seek Social Security benefits. Applications of this rule could endanger the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens.H.J. Res. 37 would nullify the rule Federal Acquisition Regulation; Fair Pay and Safe Workspaces, 81 Fed. Reg. 58562 (August 25, 2016). The bill disapproves a rule that would require federal contractors to disclose findings of non-compliance with labor laws. The rule would bog down Federal procurement with unnecessary and burdensome processes that would result in delays, and decreased competition for Federal government contracts. Rolling back this rule will also help to reduce costs in Federal procurement.

60,2017-02-01,Statement by the National Security Advisor,"Recent Iranian actions, including a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants, underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Irans destabilizing behavior across the Middle East.The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology.These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels, and threatened U.S. and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea. In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region.The Obama Administration failed to respond adequately to Tehrans malign actionsincluding weapons transfers, support for terrorism, and other violations of international norms. The Trump Administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity, and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East and place American lives at risk.President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama Administration, as well as the United Nations  as being weak and ineffective.Instead of being thankful to the United States for these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened.As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.",19890.94,26.849999999998545,5642.65,27.859999999999673,2279.55,0.680000000000291
61,2017-02-01,Remarks by President Trump in Meeting with SCOTUS Groups,"Roosevelt Room11:44 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: One person that likes me at this table, I can tell you that. (Laughter.) MR. COLLAMORE: More than one.THE PRESIDENT: I have a lot of them. I have a lot. You've been great friends and supporters and appreciated for, number one, the election. And I appreciate all of the help in deciding who to pick for the United States Supreme Court. And, Leonard, you were fantastic. All of you were. And Jim DeMint -- I don't know if Jim is here or not but they were great, Heritage. You really did. You really helped. And the rollout has been fantastic. I don't know how anybody can oppose him, frankly. I don't know how anybody can oppose him at all, but it really has been a beautiful thing to see. So we had a very successful event. He's a terrific person, by the way. I got to know him reasonably well before we did the announcement, and he is just a spectacular man. I think he will be a spectacular -- you know, you tell me, how would they go about -- Leonard, how would they go about opposing him? He's perfect in almost every way. But they'll look for the ""almost,"" right? They'll say, what's the ""almost?"" MR. LEO: He's got an impeccable record.THE PRESIDENT: Well, Federalist really -- they really did a great job. So we're going to be talking about working with the judge and maybe making this a fast process. And nominating a justice of the Supreme Court is one of the most important things that I can do as President. I've always said this -- as I watched Presidents -- I'd say the most important thing. And I think I want to refine that a little bit. I think probably defense of our country might be now -- you know, it's -- otherwise we don't need the Supreme Court so badly, right? We're doing well in that regard, very well. I think we have problems that are a lot bigger than people understood. I think I was left something isn't -- had a lot of problems, but I think we'll straighten out those problems. I think we'll straight them out very strongly. Judge Gorsuch is an exceptionally qualified person from the standpoint of experience and education. Columbia with honors, Harvard Law School with honors, Oxford at the highest level. Great, great student, great intellect. Supreme Court Justices White and Kennedy he clerked. And so I just think it's really great that we're having this meeting, because we want to have him go through an elegant process as opposed to a demeaning process. Because they're very demeaning on the other side and they want to make you look as bad as possible. And, of course, the press can be very demeaning too, but I'm sure the press will be very dignified in this case.But I really want -- that's the word -- I really think he's a very dignified man. I'd like to see him go through a dignified process. I think he deserves that. And hopefully it will go quickly and we'll see what happens.So what we might do is -- just before they leave -- we might ask for the folks in the room just to give yourself a quick -- your name and a little introduction. And, Wayne, I would say they know you. Perhaps they know you better than they know me. (Laughter.)MR. LAPIERRE: I doubt that. Wayne LaPierre, National Rifle Association.MS. NANCE: I'm Penny Nance. I'm the CEO and president of Concerned Women for America.MS. YOEST: I'm Charmaine Yoest.

Thank you. MR. COLLAMORE: Tom Collamore with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Mr. President, congratulations on the fantastic nomination. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.MR. NORQUIST: Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Reform. And thank you for winning the election.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.MR. LEO: Leonard Leo, the Federalist Society.MS. DANNENFELSER: Margorie Dannenfelser, the Susan B. Anthony List.MR. BLACKWELL: Morton Blackwell, the Leadership Institute.MR. O'STEEN: David O'Steen, National Right to Life. Thank you for such a quick, expert nomination.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much.MS. WHITE: Paula White, Chairman of the Evangelical Advisory Council.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Paula. Thank you for the help during the campaign.So, with that, I'll ask you to all hit the road. (Laughter.)Q  Mr. President, as you pointed out last night, the judge was confirmed on a unanimous voice. Well, he's -- can I ask a question, Mr. President? You all right? Thank you. As you pointed out last night, Judge Gorsuch was confirmed on a unanimous voice vote in 2006. Now, a number of Democrats say they are going to oppose him. What would you say to those Democrats? And would you encourage Senator McConnell to invoke the nuclear option if he feels he can't get 60 votes?THE PRESIDENT: I think there's a certain dishonesty if they go against their vote from not very long ago. And he did get a unanimous endorsement, and he's somebody that should get it. I mean, you can't do better from an educational, from an experience, from any standpoint. A great judge; he'll be a great justice. So, no, I feel that it's very dishonest if they go about doing that. And, yes, if we end up with the same gridlock that they've had in Washington for the last -- longer than eight years, in all fairness to President Obama, a lot longer than eight years -- but if we end up with that gridlock, I would say, if you can, Mitch, go nuclear. Because that would be a absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web. So I would say it's up to Mitch, but I would say go for it.END11:50 A.M.

62,2017-02-01,Remarks by President Trump in African American History Month Listening Session,"Roosevelt RoomTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. These are a lot of my friends, but you have been so helpful. And we did well. The election, it came out really well. Next time well triple it up or quadruple it, right? We want to get over 51, right? At least 51. Well, this is Black History Month, so this is our little breakfast, our little get-together. Hi, Lynne, how are you? MS. PATTON: Hi, how are you?THE PRESIDENT: Nice to see you. And just a few notes. During this month, we honor the tremendous history of the African Americans throughout our country -- throughout the world, if you really think about it, right? And their story is one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work and faith in America.Ive gotten a real glimpse -- during the campaign, Id go around with Ben to a lot of different places that I wasnt so familiar with. Theyre incredible people. And I want to thank Ben Carson, whos going to be heading up HUD. Its a big job, and its a job thats not only housing, its mind and spirit, right, Ben? And you understand that. Nobody is going to be better than Ben.Last month, we celebrated the life of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., whose incredible example is unique in American history. You read all about Dr. Martin Luther King a week ago when somebody said I took the statue out of my office, and it turned out that that was fake news. (Laughter.) It was fake news. The statue is cherished. Its one of the favorite things in the -- and we have some good ones. We have Lincoln and we have Jefferson and we have Dr. Martin Luther King, and we have -- but they said the statue, the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King was taken out of the office. And it was never even touched. So I think it was a disgrace, but thats the way the press is. Very unfortunate.I am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other things. Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody whos done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I notice -- Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who made America what it is today. Big impact.I am proud to honor this heritage, and well be honoring it more and more. The folks at the table in almost all cases have been great friends and supporters. And Darrell -- I met Darrell when he was defending me on television. (Laughter.) And the people that were on the other side of the argument didnt have a chance, right? And Paris has done an amazing job in a very hostile CNN community. (Laughter.) Hes all by himself -- seven people and Paris. So Ill take Paris over the seven. (Laughter.) But I dont watch CNN so I dont get to see you as much as I want to. (Laughter.) I dont like watching fake news.PARTICIPANT: None of us watch it either anymore.THE PRESIDENT: But Fox has treated me very nice -- wherever Fox is, thank you. Were going to need better schools, and we need them soon. We need more jobs, we need better wages -- a lot better wages. Were going to work very hard on the inner city. Ben is going to be doing that big league. Its one of his big things that were going to be looking at.We need safer communities, and were going to do that with law enforcement. Were going to make it safe. Were going to make it much better than it is right now. Right now its terrible, and I saw you talking about it the other night, Paris, on something else that was really -- you did a fantastic job the other night on a very unrelated show. Im ready to do my part -- its the only time I can see him. Im ready to do my part, and I will say this: Were going to work together. This is a great group. This is a group thats been so special to me. You really helped me a lot. If you remember, I wasnt going to do well with the African American community, and after they heard me speaking and talking about the inner city and lots of other things, we ended up getting -- I wont go into details, but we ended up getting substantially more than other candidates who had run in the past years. And now, were going to take that to new levels.I want to thank my television star over here. (Laughter.) Omarosa is actually a very nice person. Nobody knows that, but -- (laughter) -- I dont want to destroy her reputation. She is a very good person and shes been helpful right from the beginning of the campaign. And I appreciate it. I really do. Very special.And so I want to thank everybody for being here. Could we maybe just go around the room and well introduce ourselves. And the press can stay for that, and Im sure they have no questions about last night because it was such a good launch. We have a fantastic, hopefully, new justice of the Supreme Court. And hopefully, that will be -- hell be approved very, very quickly. Hes outstanding in every way -- academically. Hes done almost as well as you did, Darrell, in college. (Laughter.) Not quite, right? But hes a great man and I think hell be a great, great justice. And hes being very well-received. It was a big evening. Very big evening.So, Paris, why dont we start with you? Go ahead.MR. DENNARD: Pleasure to be here, Mr. President. Honor to be here. Paris Dennard. Thurgood Marshall College Fund represents the 47 publically supported historically black colleges and universities, which I know you are very much in support of. So its a pleasure to be here, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Well, Im glad youre in support of me because Id be all -- Id be in the wilderness without you guys. You are so effective. I appreciate it.MR. DENNARD: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.MR. CLEVELAND: Bill Cleveland. I'm a retired Capitol police officer, former vice mayor of the city of Alexandria, and substitute teacher in the Alexandria school system. Glad to be here.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.MR. MATTHEWS: Bill is also a Vietnam veteran, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Oh, good. MR. MATTHEWS: Im Earl Matthews, sir. I work for you at the Department of Defense. I was sworn in an hour after you were. Also a veteran and a longtime supporter of yours. I've worked for you since late summer. I'm happy to be here. THE PRESIDENT: Lieutenant Colonel -- good job. MS. SCOTT: I'm Belinda Scott, Darrell's wife. New Spirit Revival Center from Cleveland, Ohio. Pastor of New Spirit. Great amount of support in the African American community where we are. We love the Lord, we love our new President, and we are praying for our President on a regular basis. THE PRESIDENT: You know, the one thing I didn't understand about Belinda -- I thought they were married maybe five or six years, because look how they look so young. (Laughter.) Should you say how many years you've been married?MS. SCOTT: Thirty-five.PASTOR SCOTT: We've been together for 38.MS. SCOTT: Been together for -- but in the Lord --(laughter) -- 35, yes.PASTOR SCOTT: Two years under -- (inaudible.) (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: That's actually amazing. I wouldn't have known.MS. SCOTT: But can I say this -- I am so grateful that our President gives us that ear to listen to the community -- to listen. And people like us are just here to constantly put that message out into the community. And we love you for that. We love you for listening and we thank you for that.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much.PASTOR SCOTT: Darrell Scott, pastor at New Spirit Revival Center and black Trump supporter. (Laughter and applause.) But speaking of the community, let me just say this real quick. Omarosa, I told you I'm going to try to throw it in. I was recently contacted by some of the top gang thugs initiative Chicago for a sit-down. They reached out to me because they associated me with you. They respect you, they believe in what you're doing, and they want to have a sit-down about lowering that body count. So in a couple of weeks, I'm going into Chicago.THE PRESIDENT: That's a great idea because Chicago is totally out of control. PASTOR SCOTT: Well, I let him know -- I said, we've got to lower that body count. We don't want to talk about anything else -- get that body count down. And they agreed. But the principle is they can do it. These are guys straight from the streets -- no politicians -- straight street guys. But they're going to commit that if they lower that body count, we'll come in and we'll do some social programs. So they're in agreement.THE PRESIDENT: If they're not going to solve the problem -- and what you're doing is the right thing -- then we're going to solve the problem for them because we're going to have to do something about Chicago. Because what's happening in Chicago should not be happening in this country.PASTOR SCOTT: But they want to work with this administration.THE PRESIDENT: Good.PASTOR SCOTT: They want to. They reached out -- I didn't reach out to them. They reached out to me.THE PRESIDENT: I understand.PASTOR SCOTT: They want to work with this administration. They believe in this administration. They didn't believe in the prior administration. They told me this out of their mouth. But they see hope with you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: I love it.MR. WILLIAMS: Mr. President, I'm a member of what we call the media, but we try to be fair and objective. (Laughter.) Not all media seems to be the opposition party. There are those that see the good that you're doing. We report it. I'm just honored to have a seat at the table today.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. And it is -- I mean, a lot of the media is actually the opposition party. They're so biased and really is a disgrace. Some of you are fantastic and fair, but so much of the media is opposition party and knowingly saying incorrect things. So it's a very sad situation. But we seem to be doing well. It's almost like, in the meantime, we won. So maybe they don't have the influence they think, but they really are -- they really have to straighten out their act. They're very dishonest people.James.PASTOR DAVIS: Pastor James Davis. We've been -- Mr. President, we've been a supporter of yours from the beginning alongside Mr. Michael Cohen and Dr. Darrell Scott with the National Diversity Coalition.

63,2017-02-01,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/1/2017, #6","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:43 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for coming. Last night, the President was honored to announce Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to serve as the next justice to the Supreme Court. It was an unbelievably phenomenal evening. Immediately after being announced, Judge Gorsuch was honored to meet with Maureen and Father Scalia. As some of you have reported, his first call after coming back behind the podium was to Merrick Garland, who I would also note has already come out to say that Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair hearing.In less than 24 hours, Judge Gorsuch has already received widespread praise from across the political spectrum as an inspired choice, with sterling academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and a steadfast commitment to constitutional principles.During his long career in public service, Judge Gorsuch has enjoyed bipartisan approval, having previously been confirmed by a voice vote to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. In fact, 12 current Democratic senators -- including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator Leahy -- were all in office when he was first confirmed without opposition in 2006.With as many as eight Democrats, like Senators Blumenthal, Durbin, McCaskill, already supporting a full hearing and vote for Judge Gorsuch, there is no question that he is a widely respected jurist who deserves to have his nomination fairly decided upon by the United States Senate.Now that Judge Gorsuch has been officially named, I hope you all allow me to talk for a moment about how exceptionally qualified he is to succeed the late, great Antonin Scalia.Judge Gorsuchs academic record is impeccable, and as he said last night, the President holds education in the highest regard. Judge Gorsuch graduated Phi Kappa Beta [sic] from Columbia, graduated cum laude from Harvard Law School, and attended Oxford as a recipient of the prestigious Marshall Scholarship.Like Justice Scalia, the cornerstone of Judge Gorsuchs judicial philosophy is fidelity to the text. He believes that judges should base their decisions solely on the law and the -- he believes -- sorry, I almost screwed that one up -- (laughter) -- he believes his decision should be based solely on the law and the Constitution, not on their own policy preferences or personal feelings. He will be a reliable and principled voice on the bench, preserving equal justice under the law, regardless of background.And I would note, I think -- and I always want to caveat this -- but to my understanding, I think he would be the first justice that will serve with the -- as someone he clerked for on the bench. So it will be a sort of first when he is confirmed by the Senate.Now, on to the issues of the day. Today is February 1st, which means we are kicking off Black History Month. The President has events planned throughout the month, starting today with a listening session that occurred earlier this morning with African American leaders in the Roosevelt Room. The meeting also included some of the administrations African American appointees.Later today, the President will issue a proclamation. The U.S. Postal Service kicked off the month by issuing the Dorothy Height Forever stamp, the 40th stamp in their Black Heritage series. Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro Women for four decades and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and the Congressional Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush in 2004 -- excuse me, 1994 and 2004. President Obama delivered her eulogy in 2010, and President Trump is now proud that the Post Office is honoring her incredible legacy as a civil rights icon.At events throughout this entire month, we'll celebrate the contributions of courageous African American leaders -- from Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass to Martin Luther King, Jr., and Clarence Thomas. African American history is American history, and this month is a great reminder of that.Continuing with todays schedule, the Vice President went to the Hill with Judge Gorsuch to meet with lawmakers for the first time since being named last night. On the Hill, the Vice President met with Majority Leader McConnell. And the staff spearheading Judge Gorsuchs nomination will also meet with Senators Cornyn, Grassley, Hatch, and Gardner.With Judge Gorsuch on Capitol Hill, I think it's a good time to talk about the confirmation process. Neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama nominated were subject to the 60-vote threshold of a Senate filibuster. They received bipartisan support because Republicans, despite some political and philosophical differences, viewed them as mainstream and qualified. And Judge Gorsuch should receive the same fair treatment.Also this morning, the President met in the Roosevelt Room with representatives of outside groups to discuss Judge Gorsuchs nomination, including David O'Steen of the National Right to Life; Paula White of the New Destiny Christian Center;Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association; Penny Nance of Concerned Women of America; Charmaine Yoest of American Values; Juanita Duggan of the National Federation of Independent Businesses; Tom Collamore of the United States Chamber of Commerce; Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform; Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society; Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List; and Morton Blackwell of the Leadership Institute.President Trump told the group that his decision on the Supreme Court is among the most important decisions he will ever make as President. He praised Judge Gorsuch for his academic and professional achievements and his lifelong devotion to the law.The attendees thanked the President for making such an inspired choice and for delivering on what was, for many of them, their number one issue in the campaign. They committed vocally to supporting Judge Gorsuch throughout the confirmation process and expressed their desire for the Senate to move swiftly to give him a fair hearing and vote. The meeting closed with the President inviting the group in the Oval Office, which several attendees really enjoyed that honor.The President then had lunch with Secretary of State designee Tillerson. Mr. Tillersons tenacity, broad experience, and deep understanding of the geopolitics are going to make him an outstanding chief diplomat for the United States, and the President is looking forward to the full vote of the Senate on his nomination.Later this evening, the President will participate in a standing legislative affairs strategy meeting with his team, who have been working closely with Congress to enact the Presidents agenda. So far, between the Vice President and staff, we've had many productive conversations with members of both parties, in both chambers, on a variety of issues, from trade to the Presidents nomination for the Cabinet and now the Supreme Court.Now, starting this week, our Legislative Affairs team will also conduct extensive outreach on behalf of Judge Gorsuchs nomination process. Clearly, this administration has made reaching out to Congress a top priority, but you know where Im going with that: Democrats in the Senate continue to use every tool at their disposal to try and get in the way of the Presidents attempts to make America great again.Just today, Senate Democrats again refused to even participate in committee votes for Senate [sic]-designees Price and Mnuchin who were moved out of the Finance Committee with zero Democrats present. Democrats also boycotted EPA Administrator-designee Pruitts hearing. They're doing their constituents and our country a disservice by resorting to these childish tactics. The Presidents Cabinet nominees will be confirmed on the floor of the Senate, once Democrats actually allow them to get a fair vote.In other Cabinet news, Attorney General-designee Senator Jeff Sessions was voted out of committee today. We look forward to his full vote as the next Attorney General.Additionally, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson -- designee -- is expected to receive a vote by the full Senate this afternoon. And finally, Veterans Administration Secretary-designee Dr. David Shulkin will go before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs at 2:30 this afternoon.A few more things before I open it up for questions.In terms of the schedule tomorrow, the President will attend the National Prayer Breakfast and have lunch with Harley Davidson executives here at the White House. The President will also meet with Senator Hatch, Senator Wyden, Congressman Neal and Congressman Brady. Further guidance on all of those meetings will be coming soon.A few personnel announcements. Today, the President sent the following nominations to the Senate: Rachel L. Brand, of Iowa, to be Associate Attorney General; Steven Andrew Engel, of D.C., to be Assistant Attorney General; and Rod J. Rosenstein, of Maryland, to be a Deputy Attorney General.On another note, yesterday we talked about recent reporting concerning the Presidents executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry. I wanted to draw your attention to some polls that have come out on that subject. For all the hysteria around the implementation of this order, the American people as a whole are very supportive of the action that the President is taking. A new Rasmussen Report polls finds that 57 percent -- which is a clear majority -- of likely U.S. voters favor a temporary ban on refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen until the government can do a better job of keeping these individuals out who pose a threat.A Reuters poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe that the United States should limit the number of refugees into the country. And the safety of the American people and the security of the American homeland are the Presidents top priorities, and most Americans agree with the steps that he's taking to keep our country safe.Further, today the United Arab Emirates foreign minister voiced his support for the Presidents decision to take our national security so seriously. The foreign minister also added that he believes the restrictions are not based on religion, but on the structural problems faced by these nations. I know that there was a question on Monday regarding Irans firing of a missile and attack on a navy vessel. Id like to introduce National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn to provide a quick update.GENERAL FLYNN: Good afternoon, everyone. Recent Iranian actions involving a provocative ballistic missile launch and an attack against a Saudi naval vessel conducted by Iran-supported Houthi militants underscore what should have been clear to the international community all along about Iran's destabilizing behavior across the entire Middle East.The recent ballistic missile launch is also in defiance of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including launches using such ballistic missile technology. These are just the latest of a series of incidents in the past six months in which Houthi forces that Iran has trained and armed have struck Emirati and Saudi vessels and threatened United States and allied vessels transiting the Red Sea. In these and other similar activities, Iran continues to threaten U.S. friends and allies in the region. The Obama administration failed to respond adequately to Tehran's malign actions, including weapons transfers, support for terrorism and other violations of international norms. The Trump administration condemns such actions by Iran that undermine security, prosperity and stability throughout and beyond the Middle East, which places American lives at risk.President Trump has severely criticized the various agreements reached between Iran, the Obama administration as well as the United Nations as being weak and ineffective. Instead of being thankful to the United States in these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened. As of today, we are officially putting Iran on notice.Thank you.MR. SPICER: Thanks, General. We are going to have a background briefing with NSA staff -- NSC staff, rather, today at 4:00 p.m. here in the briefing room. Further details will be provided on that subject. So thank you, General, with that.As we start off, I mentioned yesterday I'm pleased that we've expanded the briefing room -- at least virtually. And so with that, as I begin to take your question, I'm pleased to offer the first-ever Skype seat question in the White House briefing room to Kim Kalunian from WPRI in Rhode Island.Kim.Q  Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?MR. SPICER: We can.Q  Great. Just this week, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island began calling our capital city a sanctuary city. As we know, President Trump's executive order says the White House will begin publicizing a weekly list of these municipalities and pledges to withdraw federal grant money from them. What I'm wondering is, is how soon we can expect to see this list, and how soon should cities like Providence expect to see their federal funding cut?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Kim. I think the President's goal in ending sanctuary cities is pretty clear. We want to, as we mentioned with these other actions, keep America safe. The goal is to make sure on two fronts. One, we are doing everything we can to protect American citizens, institutions, and ending sanctuary cities is one of the ways in which we can continue to do that. Furthermore, the President has been very clear through his executive order that federal funds, paid for by hardworking taxpayers, should not be used to help fund sanctuary cities. As we continue to implement this executive order and fulfill the pledge that he made, we'll have further updates on how we tend to -- on how that list will come out and when it will come out. So I look forward to following up on that as well.With that, David Jackson.Q  David isn't here but I'll ask a question. (Laughter.)MR. SPICER: Go for it. (Laughter.)Q  Maybe he's on Skype? (Laughter.)Q  The President's daily briefing has been renamed the daily intelligence briefing. Can you tell me how that differs at all from the PDB? Is the President receiving his intelligence briefing in writing or orally, and who is giving it to him?MR. SPICER: He did receive an intelligence briefing today. Congressman -- or Director Pompeo was here. General Flynn, his national security advisor, his briefer. So he receives an intelligence briefing and the PBD every day.Q  Is there any sense that we should get out of the renaming of it from the PDB?MR. SPICER: I think it is a more comprehensive -- again, I think -- we went through this during the transition period, right? There is a difference between the raw intelligence and the analysis, and I think he is constantly updated by his national security team and other intelligence officials. But every single day, he does receive the PBD. And then I think, on top of that, he is receiving intelligence briefings from his team. Q  But the oral briefing does not necessarily happen every day?MR. SPICER: Well, I can get back to you on that. He does get the PBD every day and on a daily basis meets with his intelligence team, yes.Q  Two quick questions.MR. SPICER: We're not going to do this again.Q  On Black History Month.MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q  Is President Obama being invited to any of the Black History Month celebrations?MR. SPICER: Not that I'm aware of. It's day one. We just started it off. We'll have to get back to you on further details. I think --Q  And if I may --MR. SPICER: We have a lot -- there's a lot of activities, as I mentioned, that the President is going to do to celebrate and honor this month. And this was just the first day of the month of February.Q  And today he made the comment about Frederick Douglass being recognized more and more. Do you have any idea what specifically he was referring to?MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's contribution -- I think he wants to highlight the contributions that he has made. And I think through a lot of the actions and statements that he's going to make, I think the contributions of Frederick Douglass will become more and more.Kristen.Q  Thank you. Very quickly, can you clarify what was meant by ""we're putting Iran on notice?""MR. SPICER: Well, as I mentioned, I think General Flynn and the NSC staff will have a briefing at 4:00 p.m. They can go forward. I'm not going to -- I think we wanted to make very clear that we felt as though that -- their actions were both provocative and a violation, and making sure that they understood that we weren't going to sit by and not act on those actions.Q  Are you building the case to --MR. SPICER: I'm just -- I'm not going to go any further than that, Kristen.Q  Okay, then let me ask you about -- let me just ask you about the confirmation hearings. How does the President plan to get Chuck Schumer onboard with his pick for the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch, when he has referred to him as a ""clown"" and accused him of fake tears?MR. SPICER: Well, I think those are two things. I think we're going to -- you look at the support that's already come out. I think there's eight senators already that have talked about the need to have a vote and his qualifications. And not just the Senate but I mean you look at the widespread support that came out for Judge Gorsuch last night across the spectrum. No matter your philosophical view of the Court, I think his qualifications for the Court, his academic background make him an unbelievably highly qualified person.And so it's not just Chuck Schumer; I think the rest of the Senate as he goes up there -- but I think the interesting thing --Q  Sure --MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. I understand that. And I think Chuck Schumer has shown time and time again through this confirmation process with the Cabinet that he's more interested in politics than actually moving the government along. And I think that is troubling.I would ask you that -- I think that the question needs to be asked to Chuck Schumer: Why are you stalling all of these nominees? Why are you insisting on new requirements that you didn't assume for Sotomayor or Kagan? I mean, there's a point at which they need to get asked, why are they obstructing government at every step of the way? There's an element to which they need to be held accountable as well. They held certain standards in place for their nominees, both for the bench and for the Cabinet. And the question is, are they going to live up to the same standards that they imposed on Republicans when they had nominees in a Democratic White House.Q  But does the President think that by personally insulting Chuck Schumer that's a way to get --MR. SPICER: But again, Kristen, I think the goal is to get -- when -- but again, I would go back. Chuck Schumer is not innocent in this. There's a lot of comments that he's made and a lot of accusations that he's thrown out there and a lot of politics that he's played. At some point, Chuck Schumer needs to be held accountable for his actions and his words. Blake.Q  Sean, the President today invoked the possibility on the Supreme Court, Sean, of the possibility of going the route of the nuclear option. If it gets to that point, is the White House comfortable with that path?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the President made clear his goal today, which is, number one, he believes that Judge Gorsuch is unbelievably qualified and that he will get nominated -- not only confirmed, but done so with a large bipartisan vote. As I said at the outset, Republicans looked at the qualifications of the two justices that got through in the Obama administration, and while they may not have agreed with their judicial philosophy, definitely agreed that they were qualified on the merits to be confirmed and they did so.I think that we would ask that we be held to the same standard that the Democrats used when they had nominees up. But I think the President made very clear that the decision is something that we would rather not have to go down, but also that it is ultimately up to Senator McConnell and how he wants to operate this.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. Just one question today. Leading up to Judge Gorsuch's announcement last night and him coming out after, there were still rumors that Judge Hardiman was going to be nominated and he, in fact, drove to Washington.MR. SPICER: No, actually, John, he didn't. That was media -- that was misreporting. My understanding is that Judge Hardiman never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. So with all due respect, I can't be held accountable for reports that falsely stated that he was here. He never was at the White House. My understanding is he had a meeting in eastern Pennsylvania with another judge. But it was -- and, again, I'm not -- I don't track his whereabouts, but my understanding is he never left the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania yesterday. So it was -- we announced when we were going to make this announcement. I think it was a phenomenal way to introduce Judge Gorsuch to the American people and the United States Senate. We invited Democratic leaders, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, none of them showed up. But it was an opportunity for them and the American people to see an amazing choice that the President made for the bench.Anita.Q  My question, Sean, my question is --MR. SPICER: You said one, John.Q  But I didn't ask the question. My question is simply this: With the support that he received, the people who called the President, would it be safe to say that Judge Hardiman will be on deck if there is another vacancy soon -- say, Justice Kennedy retiring by the end of the term?MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's a lot of vacancies that we see at the appellate level and throughout the government. He's an impressive, impressive jurist. Obviously the four that really made that final list for the President were unbelievably impressive. So I don't want to get in front of the President.Hopefully he continues to have the President's support and is someone that the President was unbelievably impressed with. So we'll have to see what vacancies come down the pipe.Anita.Q  I know you love when we say we have two questions. I do have two quick questions about something you mentioned at the top. First, you mentioned the three folks that are being nominated to the Department of Justice. Why are they being nominated now, before Senator Sessions is there? Is it because there's a lack of people? Was he consulted? Or is it just because of the whole issue this week with the acting attorney general?MR. SPICER: It's the normal process of getting those -- I've mentioned at a few briefings -- the deputies, the unders, and the actings are in the pipeline. We announced one the other day for Homeland. We've got Commerce was previously announced. And so this is just a continuation of the process to fill --Q  So would then Senator Sessions -- I mean, in speaking with him --MR. SPICER: Of course. These are people that he is clearly aware of and supportive of, 100 percent.Q  Okay. And then the second question was, you mentioned tomorrow the meeting with the Harley Davidson executives. There's reporting that he was supposed to go to Milwaukee tomorrow or he was supposed to. That was canceled because of the company. Can you talk about that?MR. SPICER: I just think -- look, it was easier for the executives to come here, considering the week and all of the activity that's been going on. And we figured the easiest thing to do was -- again, no decision had been made about or announced as to what we were doing. We looked at different options and, ultimately, the easiest thing to do in accordance with the President's schedule was to invite them here to Washington to talk about some of the stuff that we've been doing.Q  Are you worried about protesting?MR. SPICER: We're not concerned. I think we're not concerned about that. We're concerned about American jobs, moving this economy forward, and we're excited to welcome them here to Washington to talk about the great work that they do and the many thousands of people that they employ.With that, let me go to the -- we're going to be here a while, guys. We'll go to the second Skype seat. Natalie Herbick from Fox 8 in Cleveland, Ohio. Natalie.Q  Secretary Spicer, thank you so much for this rare opportunity. I appreciate it. And I'm learning the ropes.MR. SPICER: Natalie, you're coming back. (Laughter.)Q  And I would like to quickly ask two questions, if I may. The first one being, President Trump has been quick to take action on several issues he's addressed along the campaign trail. And with that in mind, he made a stop here in Cleveland and he said that he would like to make cities like ours the economic envy of the world -- a bold statement. So our viewers would love to know an example, a specific example, as to how he plans to do this sooner than later.MR. SPICER: That's a great question, Natalie. I think it's not just Cleveland but it's Detroit and so many of the other cities around the country. You've heard the President talk about the need to rebuild our inner cities. We were really impressed with Cleveland this past July -- we went there for the national convention -- the people of Cleveland, their desire and the rebound that the city has taken. And I think that when you go to -- whether it's a city like Cleveland or Detroit through different tax and regulatory measures, there's a way that we can continue to bring manufacturing back, we can continue to bring jobs back. And whether it's Harley Davidson or Carrier or Lockheed or Boeing or the GM, Fiat, Ford, these companies, he continues to talk with about how they can bring jobs back, relocate. I think that was, again, another one of the conversations that he had with the pharmaceutical companies yesterday. How can they bring jobs back? How can we ease regulations to do that?So it's about making sure that we have an environment, Natalie, that allows more cities to compete, to grow the manufacturing base, and to recognize the things that we can do, tax-wise and regulatory-wise, to allow that to flourish.Cecilia.Q  Thank you. And Steve Bannon can be heard on recording saying, ""Islam is a dark religion, not a religion of peace, a religion of submission."" Does the President share his chief strategist's apparent beliefs on Islam?MR. SPICER: No, I think the President has been very clear that his number one goal is not to target any one religion but places and areas where we believe that there is an issue. That's what the executive order was all about the other day -- making sure that areas that we don't feel have the proper mechanisms in place to assure the security -- that when they travel to the United States, that we know that they're coming here for peaceful purposes.The President's number-one goal has always been to focus on the safety of America, not the religion. He understands that it's not a religious problem, it's a radicalization problem. There's a big difference between Islam, the religion, and radical Islamic terrorists that come here to seek to do us harm.Q  But nothing about his comment that the President wants to distance himself from or even elaborate on?MR. SPICER: I just think I made it clear that there's a difference between the President's view.Yeah.Q  Thanks. There have been multiple reports of people landing Saturday in the U.S. with valid visas who were denied entry and placed on flights back out of the country. So that's in violation of at least five of these federal judges' orders that came down. Is the White House working to ensure that those people illegally deported can return to the U.S.? And are these court orders causing any second thinking about certain aspects of the order?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that we just -- we issued earlier today some clarification -- an update from the Counsel's Office that clarifies section 3C and 3E that legal permanent residents, LPRs, do not -- that the waiver -- you no longer need a waiver. Initially, as the program was lifting off, the idea was that they would go through, be granted a waiver of which everyone was issued a waiver coming in.In the sake of efficiency, we have interpreted the guidance to all of these agencies to both the Acting Secretary of State, the Acting Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security that the guidance is -- that all individuals are responsible for the administration implementation of this order -- that that does not apply. They no longer need a waiver, because if they are a legal permanent resident, they won't need it anymore.Q  Sean?MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q  On Glass-Steagall, the President during his campaign said that he supported a reestablishing of Glass-Steagall legislation, which would separate the investment banks from the commercial banks. There's legislation on both the House and the Senate side. It's in the Republican program. Mr. Mnuchin when he was queried on the Hill by Senator Cantwell, who is the author of one of the bills, was a little bit more ambiguous on this issue. And I wish you could say something on where this President stands on this.MR. SPICER: I think part of the reason that it's -- we've got to get a Treasury Secretary confirmed. And I think that when we sit here and get asked questions about policy and you go department after department, -- whether it's Treasury, Energy, EPA, HHS, HUD, Education -- the list goes on and on. And so you ask about issues and where the President's agenda is. Well, the reason that the President nominated these highly qualified people was to implement his agenda. And Senate Democrats continue to hold that up. And I think when you -- you can't -- you're asking us about how we're going to move forward on an agenda, whether it's Glass-Steagall or so many other issues. And at the same time, the Democrats are holding up the confirmation of these highly qualified people. Until that occurs, it makes it a heck of a lot harder.Q  But the President --MR. SPICER: Major Garrett.Q  -- still supports Glass-Steagall.MR. SPICER: The President's position is consistent, yes.Q  Sean, a broad topic I'd like you to take on, which is dissent within the administration, and specifically related to the President's lunch with Rex Tillerson today. More than 1,000 employees at the State Department, Foreign Service officers and others, have signed this dissent-gape. Is it the President's position that Rex Tillerson, when he's confirmed, should go through the formal process, meet with those people, and have a dialogue as previous Secretaries of State have? And is it the President's point of view that when there is dissent, it can be rooted in a philosophical disagreement that's not necessarily in defiance of his orders and that there can be a dialogue, and that it can maybe inform him differently about policy?MR. SPICER: Sure. I think the President has always --Q  Because you said a couple days ago they should get out if they --MR. SPICER: No, no, no, I think there's a difference. Just to be clear on this -- every American has a right to speak their mind. That's one of the amazing beauties of this country. You have the ability to write what you want through our First Amendment, and people have a right to speak out, and that's not hampered. The point that I was making then is that if you believe so deeply that the policy is offensive to you, then you have to understand that the job, the way our government works is we elect a President, and that President gets to carry through their agenda that they set out with the American people during the campaign.  And so they have a right to express it. And I think Secretary Tillerson, for those who have gotten to meet him, has a very open mind and a desire to meet with people and hear ideas, as does the President, as evidenced through what did through the transition, and what he's done since he's become President. He has met with groups, businesses, associations, Republicans, Democrats, independents, that have been supportive of him, that have not been supportive of him. And I think that he's going to continue to do that.So people have a right to speak their mind, but I think there's a difference between expressing dissent and concern, and not implementing a lawful order, as the acting Attorney General did the other night. But again, I dont mean to keep coming back to this, but you're asking what we'll do when Rex Tillerson becomes. And part of the problem right now is I can't fully answer your question because Democrats are holding up and slow-walking this nomination. So to presuppose what Rex Tillerson is going to do -- you know, again, I just -- it's ironic that we're being asked what these secretaries will do when they get into office, and the Democrats won't let them assume this, when we all know that the votes are there for them.Q  But I'm just talking about a particular process that has historically been (inaudible) in the State Department.MR. SPICER: I understand that. And I think -- but again, I think for me to presuppose what Secretary-designee Tillerson is going to do prior to him actually getting sworn in, I dont -- he probably will, I dont know. But it would be irresponsible of me to answer a question about what he's going to do before he actually gets sworn in.Q  Thanks, Sean. Senate Democrats have been described as ""bitter"" over the manner in which Judge Merrick Garland was treated when he was nominated for the Supreme Court. Do you feel, does the President feel that that bitterness is well-founded?MR. SPICER: I dont know, I'm not a Senate Democrat. I think they have a right to feel the way they do. I think we've explained our position, both during last year when this was going on, that we felt as though this was up to the voters to make a decision on. And as I pointed out yesterday, so many voters made up their mind based on who they believe the candidates would appoint. Mr. Trump -- then Mr. Trump -- then-candidate Trump, now President Trump was very clear about the type of people that he was going to put forth first in a list of 10 and then in a list of 11 additional ones. So I think the American people knew clearly where he was going to go. He followed through on that campaign promise. And I think that when you look at the number of people who solely based their vote on that, never mind it was -- and then you expand that, it was pretty clear that that was an important factor in the election.So I understand it, but I also think that's -- we had an election, it was a major issue in that election, and I think that even when you look across the spectrum -- Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative -- Judge Gorsuch has an unbelievable record and is being praised for that record because of that.Q  I want to ask about Friday, and there's been some reporting that there will be a meeting with President Trump and JP Morgan CEO and others. Can you tell us a little bit more about who else will be there and where things are at on financial reform? What message does the President have for bankers, specifically, on financial reform? We've heard so much about Obamacare and tax reform, but it seems like financial reform has sort of fallen by the wayside.MR. SPICER: Well, I wouldnt agree with that. I think that when you look at regulatory reform and tax reform, and all of the steps that he's been taking to help the economy grow and to create jobs, that's right in that wheelhouse. I hope to have further updates on the schedule for you tomorrow, but I dont now. Mara.Q  Thank you, Sean. I have question about foreign policy, but I wanted to follow up. You said that LPRs no longer need a waiver, but you didnt answer the question about what about the people who were put on planes, people who were LPRs but would put on planes back to where they came from. What happens to them?MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think then they go through the process. It depends if they're an LPR; if not, then they go through the application process. So if they are an LPR, a legal permanent resident, then they are waived, they can come right through.Q  So they can come back again?MR. SPICER: That's right. But I dont know how many cases that applies to. I know that if they're not a legal permanent resident, then they have to go back. And that's part of this vetting process.Q  Sean --Q  Wait, my question is about the fighting in Ukraine and Russia-backed rebels are moving the lines forward. And I'm wondering if the President feels that Russia is testing him because this is coming so early in his administration before he's had a chance to fully assemble his team, and what he plans to do about it.MR. SPICER: The President has been kept aware of, through his National Security Council and his national security team as a whole, what's been going on in the Ukraine, and we'll have further updates as we go on.Q  During the campaign last January, Donald Trump promised that on his first day in office he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools and on military bases. When can we expect action on that? And if so, can you share details of what we should expect?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think you've seen that the President has been very active in terms of getting executive orders out and following up on the campaign pledges that he made to the American people last night, being another example of that. We're going to continue to move through this process, and I think we'll have further updates on where we are with respect to the rest of the EO process.With that, I want to go to my third Skype seat, Lars Larson of the Lars Larson Show. Q  Commander Spicer, it's a pleasure. Thanks for your service to America, and thanks for the opportunity. I've got a broad question. The federal government is the biggest landlord in America. It owns two-thirds of a billion acres of America. I dont think the Founders ever envisioned it that way. Does President Trump want to start returning the people's land to the people? And in the meantime, for a second question -- since that's in fashion these days -- can he tell the Forest Service to start logging our forests aggressively again to provide jobs for Americans, wealth for the Treasury, and not spend $3.5 billion a year fighting forest fires?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Lars. I think the President has been very clear that as part of an overall comprehensive energy solution, that we've got to utilize the resources that we have, that the federal government owns, whether that's the forests or natural resources or minerals that exist above and below the ground, that we have too infrequently looked at our own resources and counted too much on foreign sources of energy.So we're going to continue, as Congressman Zinke goes through the process to head up the Interior Department, and Governor Perry goes through his appointment -- his confirmation process, to get those individuals through, but then working together in areas where they have overlap and also on areas where they will act individually to realize, to look at those natural resources that we have and figure out how to best utilize them to benefit not just our energy, but also economic growth opportunities with that.Daniel Happer (ph)Q  I was wondering about executive orders. You havent really explained why the President is using the executive orders in the manner that he's doing so. Why not take this extreme vetting to Congress and have a congressional bill? And why not -- I mean, what is the philosophy behind --MR. SPICER: Well, I dont think it's a binary choice, Daniel. I dont think it's ""only do this."" I think he has talked about -- especially in the area of immigration -- he's been very, very clear that this a huge priority for him. And I think that he is going to continue to look at this from a holistic aspect. In other words, visas, visa reform, the wall, our southern border, our northern border -- all of these things that -- you know, vetting. Those are very, very comprehensive. And those things in which he can do through executive order and action, he will. Those things that he can do through working with Congress legislatively, he's going to continue to do as well.Toluse from Bloomberg.Q  The President's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro, told The Financial Times yesterday that he believes that the euro is grossly unvalued, and Germany is benefiting from that and that's why we have a huge trade deficit with Germany and with Europe. Does the President agree with that, that the euro is undervalued? And if so, does he plan to do anything about it?MR. SPICER: I think when it comes to currency valuation, I'm not going to get -- I think we've got a Secretary of Treasury that's in the confirmation process. And once that happens, I think then Secretary Mnuchin will be able to address that, as well. Q  Sean, Dan Hausle, 7News of Boston. I'd like to ask you about Kelly Ayotte's role shepherding --MR. SPICER: I was hoping you were going to ask about the Patriots. (Laughter.)Q  Well, I would like to ask you about that.MR. SPICER: You'll get a second -- (laughter) --Q  Okay, I'll get a second. But can you talk about Kelly Ayotte's role shepherding Justice Gorsuch around Capitol Hill?MR. SPICER: Sure. Look, Senator Ayotte is someone who's respected on both sides of the aisle. She has a lot of great relationships. She's a former attorney general. She understands the judicial process very well, but she's also -- I mean, this process is a relationship process by and far. You're going around introducing a judge, someone who has not generally been exposed to the legislative process, definitely not the congressional process. Q  Her relationship with President Trump was stranger in the campaign, and kind of --MR. SPICER: That's right. And I think that that goes and shows, as I've mentioned several times both through the transition and early, the President is not holding some kind of test about what degree of support you had for him. He wants the best and brightest to continue to serve this country in whatever capacity they can. I think Senator Ayotte very, very helpfully offered up her services. She's got a lot of relationships on both sides of aisle. She's got a tremendous amount of experience in this field. And I think the President thought she was extremely qualified to do this to help shepherd this unbelievably qualified justice through this process.And so she, as well as the team that we've gathered of individuals on staff here, are going to help get Judge Gorsuch through the nomination process. And I would say, just as a side note, that if you look at the amazing job that has been done by the team during the transition and now to get these amazing individuals through the process, despite all of the hype that continues to go about this individual is going to face this problem, or which is the one person -- each of them have really sailed through this process. And story after story says Democrats have tried to land a -- take them out and couldnt land a glove. They're unbelievably qualified. They're unbelievably prepared. And I think that the same process that we followed with this is going to be followed with Judge Gorsuch, and I think we're going to have a very speedy --Q  As a follow-up -- as an unbiased Rhode Island native, can you offer your Super Bowl pick? And President Trump has also showed quite an affinity for Tom Brady and --MR. SPICER: I will. I think you know where I come down on that one. Q  Thanks, Sean. Senators Murkowski and Collins both say they're going to vote ""no"" on Betsy DeVos's nomination. That leaves zero votes to spare. And Vice President Pence would have to cast the tie-breaking vote. So my questions are, how confident are you that you have all of the other Republican senators locked down? And what's the level of concern in the White House that her nomination is going to fail?MR. SPICER: Zero. I am 100 percent confident she will be the next Secretary of Education. She is an unbelievably qualified educator and advocate for students, teachers, parents. I think that the games that are being played with Betsy DeVos are sad. She is someone who's been a tireless advocate over the last couple decades to really support reforms that benefit children. And they are going to be the real winners with her as the Secretary of Education.Sarah Murray.Q  In terms of both the two Republican senators who are voting no on Betsy DeVos and the outcry we saw from Republicans on the Hill last week -- earlier this week about how you guys dealt with the travel ban. First, is there more that the Trump administration and Trump himself should be doing to ensure that his party is on the same page with his priorities? And secondly, on the Yemen raid, can you give us more of an understanding of was there a discussion about the risks involved in this? Was it a straightforward decision? And do you guys still view it to be a success in spite of the death of a Navy SEAL?MR. SPICER: So first, I would just note, Sarah, that I've heard story after story in the last 40 days about how whether -- going back to the last question about these nominees and not getting through. Rex Tillerson was going to go down and so-and-so was going to -- and every one of them, after they got to meet with senators of both sides of the party, have shown why the President chose them -- because they were unbelievably qualified, unbelievably ready to lead and enact an agenda of change in the area of responsibility that they're taking over. And I think the same is going to be true for everyone else who is remaining.Q  But two members of your own party disagree.MR. SPICER: The vote hasn't taken place. I think we've had some concerns in the past and I think when these nominees have met with them and shared with them their thoughts throughout the process -- and, again, you can go back, story after story, and again, each one of these folks who I've heard isn't going to make it, is going to go over the finish line each time. And I think that -- we hear it over and over again and yet we succeed every time. And yet, another roadblock is put up -- well, this person won't succeed. And yet, you look at each one of these people going through the process and it's worked beautifully every time. And I think we're going to continue that path.With respect to Yemen, I think it's hard to ever say something was successful when you lose a life. But you've got to understand that Chief Owens -- he went back, deployed 12 times, because he loved this country and he believed in the mission. And knowing that we killed an estimated 14 AQAP members and that we gathered an unbelievable amount of intelligence that will prevent the potential deaths or attacks on American soil is something that I think most servicemembers understand that that's why they join the service.And so you never want to call something a success, 100 percent, when someone is hurt or killed, and that was the case here, but I think that when you recognize that an individual like this loved this country so much and deployed over and over again because he knew that the mission that he was conducting was so important to our protection, our freedom, our safety. And I know that when the President spoke to Karen, his wife, and talked about the three children that he left behind, she continued to be impressed with -- to impress upon the President, rather, that while it was an unbelievably sad and emotional time for her and her family, that he loved doing this.And so, again, I don't think you ever call anything 100 percent success, but what he did for this nation and what we got out of that mission, I think I truly believe -- and I know the President believes -- it's going to save American lives.With that, let me go to the last question on Skype and then we'll continue. Jeff Jobe of South Central Kentucky -- of the Jeff Jobe Publishing in South Central Kentucky.Jeff.Q  Thank you for allowing me to be part of today's White House press briefing. Clearly, anyone paying attention will see that President Trump is aggressively acting on his campaign promises. This in itself gives hope to my state and particularly the region in which I grew up, Appalachia. We've seen countless politicians make promises at both state and national levels, and not only forget us, but to turn on us. So my question is, how soon or when will the roles restricting coal mining, coal burning and coal exports be reversed?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Jeff. I've talked about this a couple times so far, but I believe -- or the President has very clearly stated that clean coal in particular is an issue that's so important to our energy independence as well as our job creation in this country. And so whether you're talking about Kentucky or West Virginia or Pennsylvania, or so many other places in this country that rely on coal, bringing the production of clean coal back is good for our energy independence, is good for our economy, is good for job creation, and is something that he continues to talk about. And I think once we have the Secretary of Energy confirmed, that we can continue to take steps to move forward with. Q  Two questions for you. After the primetime announcement last night, it seems like the numbers were good. Do you have a sense that this President will be more aggressive than his predecessors on seeking primetime air play for his announcements? And two, top Democrats are asking the Defense Department to investigate Michael Flynn's possible violation of the Constitution. Do you have a -- it sounds like you saw that story. Do you have a response to that?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think on the air time issue, that's something that we're not particularly suffering from when it comes to attention. And I think the President does a phenomenal job of getting attention and getting his message out. His use of social media in particular that when you look at the number of people -- I think we had something like 11 million people watching the address on Facebook Live last night. Obviously if we have important issues to discuss with the nation, or announcements to make or nominations, then we'll request time. I dont think that that's something that we've spent a ton of time figuring out. I think we're doing pretty well on that front.And then, I'm sorry, the second question, Mike?Q  The request from Democrats to investigate Flynn for a possible violation of the Emoluments Clause.MR. SPICER: Yeah, so General Flynn, like I think probably countless, if not hundreds, of retired flag officers joins his speaking bureau, and has given speeches at various places. And I think that is something that is kept in practice. And the Department of Defense is the appropriate place for them to review it. But as I said, I think that when you look at so many countless retired flag officers, that's something that generally keeps (inaudible).Zeke.Q  Thanks, Sean. General Flynn, when he was up here, offered some criticism about the Obama administration's handling of Iran in particular. Is that something we should be expecting to hear more from this administration, whether it be on foreign policy or other issues -- criticism of the previous administration going forward?MR. SPICER: I think in area where there's going to be a sharp difference, in particular national security, in contrasting the policies that this President is seeking to make the country safer, stronger, more prosperous, he's going to draw those distinctions and contrast out. But in this particular area, I think the President, when it came to the Iran nuclear deal, was very, very adamant in his opposition to the deal and to its implications. And so he's going to continue to make sure that the American people know that some of these deals and things that were left by the previous administration, that he wants to make very clear what his position is and his opposition to them. And the action and the notice that he put Iran on today is something that is important, because I think the American people voted on change. Again, this is another issue that he was very clear about.So with that, thank you, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. Take care. Have a good day.END2:32 P.M.

67,2017-02-02,President Donald J. Trump Proclaims February as American Heart Month,"AMERICAN HEART MONTH, 2017- - - - - - -BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATIONThe death rate from heart disease in the United States has fallen dramatically since the 1960s, a significant public health victory. Despite this progress, heart disease remains a leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States, and we must reduce its toll. During American Heart Month, we remember those who have lost their lives to heart disease and resolve to improve its prevention, detection, and treatment. It is a time for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to improving cardiovascular health for ourselves, our families, and our communities.Over the past several decades, we have learned much about factors that contribute to heart disease, how to monitor those triggers, and ways to treat them. We know that individuals can live longer and better lives by refraining from tobacco use, maintaining an optimal blood pressure and a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. Innovative companies continue to offer new tools and online systems, giving people more access than ever to information they can use to make informed, health-conscious choices.Scientific research and evidence-based interventions to prevent or treat heart attacks and strokes have played an important part in making these strides. Developments in technology and the discovery of early markers of heart disease have allowed us to diagnose and treat heart disease sooner than ever before. American innovators continue to develop treatments for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and our health care providers continue to promote best strategies and educate Americans to stay heart healthy.To highlight the importance of preventing heart disease, Melania and I invite all Americans to wear red this Friday, February 3, 2017, to observe National Wear Red Day. Working together on National Wear Red Day, and throughout the year, we can raise awareness about heart disease and make our Nation healthier.In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved on December 30, 1963, as amended (36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as American Heart Month.NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2017 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 3, 2017. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this second day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.DONALD J. TRUMP",19884.91,-6.029999999998836,5636.2,-6.449999999999818,2280.85,1.2999999999997272
68,2017-02-02,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/2/2017, #7","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room12:32 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Happy Groundhog Day. We've got six more weeks of winter, apparently. Luckily, for those of you who are going to be joining the President down to Florida this weekend, you'll get some time to get a glimpse of summer at the ""Winter White House"" in Mar-a-Lago.The President is going to start his meeting at 1:00 sharp. You probably just saw the b-roll of folks from Harley rolling on in, literally. So Im going to try to keep this a little quick.The President signed a proclamation yesterday ushering in Black History Month. He looks forward to an engaging and informative month of events honoring the enormous contributions that African Americans have made throughout our history.Last night, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of the next Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, in the Oval Office. As the President said last night, Secretary Tillerson is a man whos already respected all over the world for the tremendous life that hes led, and now will bring his years of experience to the critical task of making our nation safer, more prosperous, and more secure.Its time to bring a clear-eyed focus to our foreign affairs, and now with Secretary Tillerson at the helm of the State Department, well do just that. We'll strengthen our alliances, form new ones, and enhance Americas interests throughout the world.Speaking of the Presidents excellent nominees, praise is pouring in from around the country for his pick for Supreme Court. The Detroit News said Judge Gorsuch is a legal superstar""; an outstanding choice, says the New Hampshire Union Leader. The Richmond Times-Dispatch says the initial reaction was to cheer. The South Florida Sun Sentinel touted his excellent qualifications.Yesterday, Judge Gorsuch had his first round of meetings on the Hill. Unfortunately, Senate offices arent in the habit of releasing editorials, but from everything we heard, the Judge knocked it out of the park on the Senate as well. The President looks forward to a fair and speedy confirmation process for this exceedingly qualified nominee and jurist. In my last briefing, I read out a list of the senators Judge Gorsuch met with. In addition to the meeting with Majority Leader McConnell, Majority Whip Cornyn, Judiciary Chairman Grassley, and Senators Hatch and Gardner, the Judge also met with Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Recently, Senator Manchin expressed his belief that Judge Gorsuch could win enough Democrats to hit 60 votes. Ill agree with the Senator there on that one. I mean, we have to have a few Trump-state Democrats who want to win re-election.But, as I pointed out yesterday, this so-called 60 vote standard is simply not accurate. Democrats are grasping at straws to block the confirmation of an unquestionably qualified nominee. Ill repeat, neither of the two Supreme Court justices that President Obama put forward were subject to the 60-vote threshold. So although I agree with Senator Manchin that Judge Gorsuch will probably get enough Democrats to get to 60, its just simply not ever been a requirement.Now, on to the events of today. The President started his day by attending the National Prayer Breakfast. It's a tradition that continued over six decades, going back to President Eisenhower. The President thanked the American people for their faith and prayers that have sustained and inspired him, noting that the five words that he has heard more than any others as hes traveled throughout the country are, I'm praying for you.He spoke at length about the ISIS genocide against Christians and the oppression of peace-loving Muslims, as well as the threats of extermination against the Jewish people, and made it clear that he believes the United States has a moral obligation to speak out against such violence.He encouraged Americans to remain a tolerant society where all faiths are respected and where all of our citizens can feel safe and secure. With that goal in mind, the President remarked that he's taken action to ensure that the United States will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread throughout our nation. In the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and reject any form of oppression or discrimination.The President also committed to get rid of the Johnson Amendment and allowing our representatives of faith to speak freely and without retribution.In a particularly poignant moment during his remarks, the President recalled yesterday his visit to Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief Ryan Owens as Americas fallen hero was returned home. After honoring Chief Owens for giving his life in defense of the American people, the President quoted John 15:13: Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends.After returning to the White House this morning, the President held a legislative affairs staff meeting in the Oval Office with his team. The team continues to work closely with Congress to enact the Presidents agenda. With the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, extensive outreach is underway on Capitol Hill and we look forward to the Judge receiving a swift and fair hearing.Between his meetings, the President was pleased to see that EPA Administrator-designee Pruitt was voted out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. As has unfortunately become the practice, Democrats again boycotted the hearing, requiring a suspension of the rules in order to advance his nomination.Following the strategy session, the President met with Senators Hatch, Wyden and Congressmen Brady and Neal. This meeting was an opportunity for the President to meet with the chairmen and ranking members of the Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee to help chart the future of U.S. trade policy. The President has put together an all-star trade team that will work closely with the U.S. Trade Representative and the committees led by these members to craft new trade deals. The President has expressed his concern time and again with NAFTA, which he believes is an out-of-date agreement. The ultimate goal is to ensure the best and fairest treatment of U.S. workers and businesses, and the President believes that those interests are best secured by bilateral, rather than multilateral trade deals. He looks forward to working closely with the USTR and Congress when it comes to issues of trade.For those of you who werent outside and just saw the Harleys roll up, its no surprise that this afternoon the President will host a meeting and listening session with Harley-Davidson executives and union representatives. For a list of those individuals, please contact our office.Harley-Davidson has been an American success story since 1901, when William S. Harley, at age 21, completed the blueprint drawing of an engine designed to fit into a bicycle. In 1903, Harley-Davidson began building motorcycles in the United States. And today, the company has approximately 6,000 employees and $6 billion in annual revenue. The companys global headquarters is located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- which may have had something to do with them getting in so quickly. And there's a certain staffer.Today, the President will welcome to the White House the latest generation of Harley-Davidson executives to discuss how to make it easier for businesses to create more jobs and factories in the United States. Beyond the company executives, representatives from the machinists and steel workers unions were also be in attendance.Their motorcycles have carried our American servicemembers in war. They carry our police officers that keep us safe. They carry the Secret Service as they protect our presidents. And they bring joy to millions of Americans and throughout the world -- and others throughout the world, rather. The President is looking forward to hosting these leaders from one of Americas truly great entrepreneurial success stories. The American worker built this country, and the President is focused on restoring a government that puts their interests first.A few administrative notes. The National Security Advisor, Mike Flynn, today announced additions to the NSC senior staff. David Cattler will be a Deputy Assistant to the President for Regional Affairs. John Eisenberg, Deputy Assistant to the President, NSC Legal Advisor, and Department [Deputy] Counsel to the President for National Security Affairs. Kevin Harrington, Deputy Assistant to the President for Strategic Planning. And Kenneth Juster, Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs.Lastly, we had a great reaction to our Skype introduction seats yesterday. I know we've had a tremendous amount of requests pouring in from around the country. Please contact the press office if you know of any that has an interest in joining us in the future. In terms of the schedule for tomorrow, the President will host a Strategic and Policy Forum. Then, in the afternoon, the President will have lunch with General Flynn before departing down to Mar-a-Lago later in the day.With that, Ill take some questions.Katie Pavlich.Q  Hi, Sean. Thanks for the question. Today, President Trump talked about Christian genocide at the National Prayer Breakfast, and last year the Obama State Department officially declared a genocide by ISIS against Christians and other minority and religious groups in the Middle East and North Africa. Now that Rex Tillerson has been sworn in as the Secretary, what specifically is the administration planning to do to comply with the legal obligations of protecting these groups under the U.N. 1948 Treaty?MR. SPICER: That's a great question. I think Secretary Tillerson is learning his way around the building so far this morning. He gave a great speech talking about his vision and goal for the State Department. I think there will be further guidance coming out on that, Katie. Right now, his job is to get in, get settled, talk to the employees, make sure they understood. But back to the issue, obviously its important to President. It was during -- throughout the campaign. Its something that he addressed this morning, and is something that he is committed to. He talked about it in terms of the executive orders, and allowing Christian minorities in key countries seek asylum in the United States. He recognizes that, in so many nations, these are the oppressed groups in accordance with how the U.N. defines refugees. So I think youll see further guidance with that.Jennifer.Q  Thanks, Sean. I have two questions, actually. Today, the President renewed his promise to protect religious liberty, which he says is under threat. Some Americans see religious liberty as code for discrimination. Can you kind of give us a sense of how the President views this tension?MR. SPICER: Its an interesting question, because I do -- you know, this is something that comes up quite a bit. I think there is a line. We have freedom of religion in this country, and I think people should be able to practice their religion, express their religion, express areas of their faith without reprisal. And I think that pendulum sometimes swings the other way in the name of political correctness. And I think the President and the Vice President both understand that one of the things that makes our country and this democracy so great is our ability to express our religion, to believe in faith, to express it, and to live by it. And thats where I think the important part is -- whether its a small business owner or employee, he wants to have some degree of expression of faith at the company. And too often those voices get pushed out in the name of political correctness. So hes going to continue to make sure that we not only speak up for it, but find ways in which we can keep that line a little less blurred and make sure that the pendulum doesnt swing against people. We shouldnt impose a religion on anybody. Were free to express our religion or be -- you know, not have one. Thats obviously, in our country, an equally valid way of living your life. But at the same time, I think people who want to express their faith shouldnt be ostracized because they want to live that.Major.Q  If you could give us an example, if you could, of the pendulum swinging in the direction of political correctness. And how is that going to inform the President with this executive order? And as you may know, a draft is circulating around town and many have wondered if that is going to be a way to either silence those on the left or be a threat to the LGBTQ community. Talk us through both of those.MR. SPICER: Well, I think if you look back to the Little Sisters case, if you look back to other businesses that were, under Obamacare --Q  Would you put Hobby Lobby in that category?MR. SPICER: I would, yeah. Absolutely. I think theres several businesses and several institutions -- Catholic institutions and others -- that have been mandated or attempted to mandate certain things that they may or may not do or how they have to treat their employees. Those are instances where clearly the pendulum is swinging a different way, where you are not carving out institutions or the ability for privately held businesses to conduct themselves to live according to their faith or their moral compass. And so theres clearly a lot of evidence in the last couple years of the government coming in with regulations and policies that have, frankly, denied people the ability to live according to their faith.Q  From the Presidents point of view, thats discriminatory in itself.MR. SPICER: Well, I think theres -- like I said, I think its a pendulum. And where the President is, is that he wants to make sure that you dont penalize someone for wanting to express their faith, and that to the extent that we can keep that line a little less blurred and allow people who dont believe in a faith or have an opposing faith, make sure that they are equally comfortable in the workplace. But we shouldnt penalize people or mandate them to abide by certain policies or regulations which are in direct contradiction to their faith.Q  And what about the executive order, Sean? MR. SPICER: Theres right now no executive orders that are official or able to read out. We maintain that theres nothing new on that front. Q  (Inaudible) drafted along --MR. SPICER: It's not a question of -- there are a lot of ideas that are being floated out -- I mentioned this the last couple days. But that doesnt mean -- part of it is, as the President does all the time, he asks for input, he asks for ideas, and on a variety of subjects there are staffing procedures that go on where people have a thought or an idea and it goes through the process. But until the President makes up his mind and gives feedback and decides that thats final, theres nothing to announce.Q  Thank you. In light of the tragedy that happened in Quebec City last week, which Prime Minister Trudeau is actually calling an act of terrorism, what is the President doing, what initiatives is he taking to make sure that that kind of homegrown -- because he was a Canadian citizen -- homegrown terrorism, homegrown violence doesnt happen within our country?MR. SPICER: Well, theres a lot of things. Number one, hes talked cyber -- I mean, hes looking at it from every angle. I think the first thing is to make sure that we look at our borders. Youve got to protect your own people first, then youve got to look at the cyber threats. I mean, so there is a holistic approach to both immigration and theres a direct nexus between immigration and national security and personal security that he has to look at. But then its a multi-tiered step. You look at the borders, you look at who were letting in, and you also look at what were doing internally with our intelligence agencies and the FBI that make sure that were looking at -- whether its the cyber threats that we face or other terrorist activities -- but making sure that were working with the NSA and the FBI to be ahead of the curve, if you will.Q  If I may, these are homegrown -- Oklahoma City was an American kid.MR. SPICER: Sure.Q  Okay. Thats all. Thats what Im asking.MR. SPICER: Thats what Im saying. But I think that, part of it is, looking at using the assets that we have here -- the NSA, the FBI -- looking at using the different agencies to see if we can get ahead of the curve and see things. And a lot of times, thats been a very big issue, is getting ahead of the curve for when there are telltale signs, having the reporting systems up, working with the various agencies. But its a multi-effort process, if you will.Kristen.Q  Sean, thank you. Why is the administration easing sanctions against Russia?MR. SPICER: Were not easing sanctions. The Treasury Department -- it is, from what I understand, its a fairly common practice for the Treasury Department, after sanctions are put in place, to go back and to look at whether or not there needs to be specific carve-outs for either industries or products and services that need to be going back and forth. But I would refer you back to the Treasury Department on that one.Q  Hold on, Sean. The language on the Treasury Department website suggests that you are, in fact, easing sanctions that authorizes certain transactions with the Federal Security Service. Does that not suggest a shift from what was put in place --MR. SPICER: No, it doesnt. Q  So explain --MR. SPICER: It is, from what I understand, a regular course of action. The Treasury does, quite often, when there are sanction imposed, but I would refer you back to the Treasury Department.Q  Thank you. Could I ask you to describe the tone of the call on the weekend between the Australian Prime Minister and the President, and also outline the Presidents concerns about the refugee deal in question? And I asked you this earlier this week, but could you clarify whether the deal is on or not? Because the President tweeted last night I will study this dumb deal,"" implying that he's still considering it. MR. SPICER: Right. The President had a very cordial conversation with Prime Minister Turnbull, where they went through an extensive discussion of this deal. The President is unbelievably disappointed in the previous administrations deal that was made and how poorly it was crafted, and the threat to national security it put the United States on.He has tremendous respect for the Prime Minister and for the Australian people, and has agreed to continue to review that deal and to ensure that as part of the deal, which was always part of it, that we would go through a very, very extreme vetting process to ensure that every single person that is being offered up is coming here with peaceful intentions and poses no threat to the United States.So he has ensured that while he has respect for the Australian people and respect for Prime Minister Turnbull, that we do not pose a threat to the United States of America, that the deal that was cut by the last administration is something that he is extremely, extremely upset with. He does not like it, but out of respect for him, hes going to allow that process -- continue to study it and allow it to move forward under the conditions that have been set -- that there will be extreme vetting on every single one of those individuals.Q  Just for clarity, the deal itself is still under review, so its not certain to proceed? Or it will proceed as --MR. SPICER: Part of the deal was that -- the deal allows for the United States to vet the individuals that are being offered up to be processed. The Presidents goal is to make sure that every single one of those people, in accordance with the deal and as discussed in the telephone conversation with the Prime Minister, is subject to extreme vetting to ensure that no one puts it. But I cannot underscore how disappointed he was in the deal that was made and how he thought it was just a horrible deal that was offered up by the United States by the previous administration.Sarah.Q  The President and his national security advisor have been clear the administration wants to put Iran on notice, but they havent specified what that is. What options are on the table? And are there any options, like military action, that might be off the table at this point?MR. SPICER: So I think General Flynn was really clear yesterday that Iran has violated the Joint Resolution, that Irans additional hostile actions that it took against our Navy vessel are ones that we are very clear are not going to sit by and take.I think that we will have further updates for you on those additional actions, but clearly we wanted to make sure that Iran understood that they are on notice, this is not going un-responded to.John.Q  Thank you very much, Sean. Q  It was a Saudi vessel. MR. SPICER: Thank you. Yes.Q  They thought it was an American, but it's a Saudi vessel.MR. SPICER: Right, thats right. John.Q  Thank you, Sean. On January 27th, at the Republican retreat in Philadelphia, Vice President Pence had a closed-door meeting with House Republicans where several of them brought up the case of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. There was an attempt to impeach him last year, which some of the leadership in the House felt was unfair to the commissioner, and they urged him to tell the President that given his entire record, he should fire him or ask for his resignation soon. My sources said the Vice President said I can hear you. Is there any pending action on the fate of Commissioner Koskinen?MR. SPICER: I have nothing to update you on. Hallie.Q  On Yemen, it was initially described, the raid over the weekend, as a successful raid by the administration. There are now some questions and comments raised about the possibility of additional civilian casualties. So Ive got a couple of questions for you on this one. Would you still stand by your characterization of the raid as successful? Was the President given multiple options about this raid, or just one? And were there consultations with the prior administrations national security officials, military officials about the raid moving forward?MR. SPICER: Thank you. Actually, Id like to just walk through that. I appreciate you bringing this up.There is -- lets go through the tick-tock on that raid. On November 7th, CENTCOM submitted the plan to DOD. Clearly, that was under the last administration. Legal teams were involved immediately when it was submitted to DOD. On December 19th, the plan was approved by the Department of Defense and recommended that it be moved ahead. It was sent then to the National Security Council staff here in the White House. Again, this all happened under the previous administration.On January 6th, there was an interagency deputies meeting. The deputies recommended at that time that they go ahead. It was so easily approved it was sent straight up. The conclusion to hold was, at that time, to hold for what they called a moonless night, which, by calendar, wouldnt occur until then-President-elect Trump was President Trump.On January 24th, shortly after taking office, Secretary of Defense-then Mattis read the memo, resent it back up to the White House conveying his support. On the 25th of January, the President was briefed by General Flynn on Secretary Mattiss recommendation and the status of the operation, or potential operation.The President asked to see Secretary Mattis and Joint Chiefs of Staff Dunford. He then, on that evening, had a dinner meeting, which included the President, the Vice President, Secretary Mattis, Chairman Dunford, Chief of Staff Priebus, Jared Kushner, Chief Strategist Bannon, General Kellogg, General Flynn, and CIA Director Pompeo where the operation was laid out in great extent. The indication at that time was to go ahead on Friday the 26th. In the morning, the deputies committee met again. It was not a necessary step because they had previously recommended and also reaffirmed their support for that. On January 26th, the President signed the memo authorizing the action. So it was a very -- not only was it a very, very though-out process by this administration, it had started back on November 7th in terms of -- clearly well before that, but it was a move forward by CENTCOM on November 7th. This was a very, very well thought-out and executed effort.Q  Where was the President the night of the raid? How did he learn about Chief Owenss death? And do you still stand by your characterization that it was successful? MR. SPICER: The President was here in the residence. He was kept in touch with his national security staff. Secretary Mattis and others had kept him updated on both the raid and the death of Chief Owens, as well as the four other individuals that were injured. So he was kept apprised of the situation throughout the evening. And again, I think -- I would go back to what I said yesterday: Its hard to ever call something a complete success when you have the loss of life, or people injured. But I think when you look at the totality of what was gained to prevent the future loss of life here in America and against our people and our institutions, and probably throughout the world in terms of what some of these individuals could have done, I think it is a successful operation by all standards.And again, I want to reiterate, it is tough to ever use the word ""success"" when you know that somebody has lost their life. But when you go back and look at an individual that dedicated their life to serving this country, and went over and over and over again knowing that this not only the risk that he took but wanted to do it because he knew the threat that these kind of individuals pose to our country and to our people, that's -- while not a success that you lost to him, you know that he died in sacrifice for someone else here in this nation.Hunter Walker. Q  Thank you, Sean. Ive seen some criticism of the Presidents remarks at the prayer breakfast this morning. Can you shed any light on why he thought that was a good venue to mock The Apprentice for its ratings?MR. SPICER: Look, Mark Burnett, the creator of The Apprentice, who is a long-time supporter of the prayer breakfast but also has a personal relationship, was there. He meant it as a light-hearted moment. And I think if you look at the totality of his remarks, they were absolutely beautiful. And I think to hone in on that, it was a light-hearted moment he was trying to have with a big supporter of the National Prayer Breakfast and a personal friend.Guys, Ill be out tomorrow. I want to make sure we all get to see the President now. Thank you, guys.END 12:57 P.M. EST#7-02/02/2017",19884.91,-6.029999999998836,5636.2,-6.449999999999818,2280.85,1.2999999999997272
69,2017-02-02,President Donald J. Trump Proclaims February As National African American History Month,"Yesterday, the President signed a Proclamation honoring February 2017 as National African American History Month.NATIONAL AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH, 2017- - - - - - -BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATIONAs we celebrate National African American History Month, we recognize the heritage and achievements of African Americans. The contributions African Americans have made and continue to make are an integral part of our society, and the history of African Americans exemplifies the resilience and innovative spirit that continue to make our Nation great.For generations, African Americans have embodied the shared progress of our Nation. Through toil and struggle and with courageous actions that have broken barriers, they have made America a better place to live and work for everybody. Women like Katherine Johnson, a pioneer in space history whose work helped America win the Space Race, and Madam C.J. Walker, who became one of the most successful female entrepreneurs of her time, paved the way for both women and African Americans in their respective fields. Robert Smalls, a man born into slavery, founded our Nation's first free and compulsory public school system. Later in life, he served as a lawmaker in SouthCarolina's State legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. The strength and determination of men and women like these remind us that our Nation brims with people whose contributions continue to make it stronger and better.This year, African American History Month calls upon us toreflect on the crucial role of education in the history of African Americans. It reminds us of the importance of teaching and reflecting upon the many roles African Americans have played in building this Nation and driving it forward. This year's theme also calls upon us to rededicate ourselves to the work of ensuring that all children in this Nation have access to quality educational opportunities that give them the skills, experiences, relationships, and credentials that can empower them to follow in the footsteps of people like Katherine Johnson, Madam C.J. Walker, and Robert Smalls.As we journey toward a stronger, more united Nation, let ususe this commemoration of African American History Month to serve as a reminder of the need for meaningful dialogue and shared commitment to collective action that uplifts and empowers, as well as of the strength, ingenuity, and perseverance required of us in the years to come.NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the UnitedStates of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the UnitedStates, do hereby proclaim February 2017 as National African American History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the UnitedStates to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of February, in the year of our Lord twothousandseventeen, and of the Independence of the UnitedStates ofAmerica the twohundred and forty-first.DONALD J. TRUMP",19884.91,-6.029999999998836,5636.2,-6.449999999999818,2280.85,1.2999999999997272
70,2017-02-02,Remarks by President Trump at National Prayer Breakfast,"Washington Hilton9:11 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mark. So nice. (Applause.) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Its a great honor to be here this morning. And so many faith leaders -- very, very important people to me -- from across our magnificent nation, and so many leaders from all across the globe.Today we continue a tradition begun by President Eisenhower some 64 years ago. This gathering is a testament to the power of faith, and is one of the great customs of our nation, and I hope to be here seven more times with you. (Laughter and applause.)I want very much to thank our co-chairs, Senator Bowzman and Senator Coons, and all of the congressional leadership -- theyre all over the place. We have a lot of very distinguished guests. And we have one guest who was just sworn in last night -- Rex Tillerson, Secretary of State. (Applause.) Going to do a great job. Some people didnt like Rex because he actually got along with leaders of the world. I said, no, you have to understand, thats a good thing. (Laughter.) Thats a good thing, not a bad thing. Hes respected all over the world, and I think hes going to go down as one of our great, great secretaries. We appreciate it. Thank you, thank you, Rex. (Applause.)Thank you as well to Senate Chaplain Barry Black for his moving words. And I don't know, Chaplain, whether or not thats an appointed position. Is that an appointed position? I dont even know if youre a Democrat or if youre a Republican, but Im appointing you for another year -- the hell with it. (Laughter and applause.) And I think its not even my appointment, its the Senates appointment, but well talk to them. Your son is here. Your job is very, very secure, okay? (Laughter.) Thank you, Barry. Appreciate it very much.I also want to thank my great friends, though, Roma. Wheres Roma? Beautiful Roma Downey. The voice of an angel. Shes got the voice -- every time I hear it, that voice is so beautiful. Everything is so beautiful about Roma, including her husband because hes a special, special friend, Mark Burnett -- for the wonderful introduction. So true. So true. I said to the agent, Im sorry. The only thing more -- I actually got on the phone and fired him myself because he said, you dont want to do it, itll never work, itll never, ever work. You dont want to do it. I said, listen -- but I really fired him after it became the number-one show. It became so successful, and he wanted a commission, and he didnt want to do it. Thats what I really said. (Laughter.)But we had tremendous success on ""The Apprentice."" And when I ran for President, I had to leave the show. Thats when I knew for sure I was doing it. And they hired a big, big movie star -- Arnold Schwarzenegger - to take my place. And we know how that turned out. (Laughter.) The ratings went right down the tubes. Its been a total disaster. And Mark will never, ever bet against Trump again. And I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, okay? (Laughter.)But weve had an amazing life together, the last 14, 15 years. And an outstanding man, and thank you very much for introducing me. Appreciate it. Its a great honor. (Applause.)I also want to thank my dear friend, Vice President Mike Pence, who has been incredible. (Applause.) And incredible wife, Karen. And every time I was in a little trouble with something, where they were questioning me, theyd say, but he picked Mike Pence -- (laughter) -- so he has to know what hes doing. And its true, hes been -- you know, on the scale of 0 to 10, I rate him a 12, okay? So I want to thank you. Thank you very much. Apprentice it. (Applause.)But most importantly today, I want to thank the American people. Your faith and prayers have sustained me and inspired me through some very, very tough times. All around America, I have met amazing people whose words of worship and encouragement have been a constant source of strength. What I hear most often as I travel the country are five words that never, ever fail to touch my heart. Thats: I am praying for you. I hear it so often -- I am praying for you, Mr. President. (Applause.) No one has inspired me more in my travels than the families of the United States military, men and women who have put their lives on the line every day for their country and their countrymen. I just came back yesterday from Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief William Ryan Owens, as Americas fallen hero was returned home. Very, very sad, but very, very beautiful. Very, very beautiful. His family was there. Incredible family, loved him so much. So devastated -- he was so devastated. But the ceremony was amazing. He died in defense of our nation. He gave his life in defense of our people. Our debt to him and our debt to his family is eternal and everlasting.Greater love hath no man than this: that a man lay down his life for his friends. We will never forget the men and women who wear the uniform, believe me. (Applause.) Thank you. From generation to generation, their vigilance has kept our liberty alive. Our freedom is won by their sacrifice, and our security has been earned with their sweat and blood and tears. God has blessed this land to give us such incredible heroes and patriots. They are very, very special, and we are going to take care of them. (Applause.) Our soldiers understand that what matters is not party or ideology or creed, but the bonds of loyalty that link us all together as one. America is a nation of believers. In towns all across our land, its plain to see what we easily forget -- so easily we forget this -- that the quality of our lives is not defined by our material success, but by our spiritual success. I will tell you that. And I tell you that from somebody that has had material success and knows tremendous numbers of people with great material success -- the most material success. Many of those people are very, very miserable, unhappy people. And I know a lot of people without that, but they have great families, they have great faith. They dont have money -- at least not nearly to the extent -- and theyre happy. Those to me are the successful people, I have to tell you. (Applause.)I was blessed to be raised in a churched home. My mother and father taught me that to whom much is given much is expected. I was sworn in on the very bible from which my mother would teach us as young children. And that faith lives on in my heart every single day.The people in this room come from many, many backgrounds. You represent so many religions and so many views. But we are all united by our faith in our Creator and our firm knowledge that we are all equal in His eyes. We are not just flesh and bone and blood. We are human beings, with souls. Our Republic was formed on the basis that freedom is not a gift from government, but that freedom is a gift from God. (Applause.)It was the great Thomas Jefferson who said, The God who gave us life, gave us liberty. Jefferson asked, Can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed a conviction that these liberties are the gift of God?Among those freedoms is the right to worship according to our own beliefs. That is why I will get rid of, and totally destroy, the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution. I will do that -- remember. (Applause.) Freedom of religion is a sacred right, but it is also a right under threat all around us, and the world is under serious, serious threat in so many different ways. And I've never seen it so much and so openly as since I took the position of President. The world is in trouble, but we're going to straighten it out. Okay? That's what I do. I fix things. We're going to straighten it out. (Applause.) Believe me. When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, dont worry about it. Just dont worry about it. (Laughter.) They're tough. We have to be tough. It's time we're going to be a little tough, folks. We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually. It's not going to happen anymore. It's not going to happen anymore.We have seen unimaginable violence carried out in the name of religion. Acts of wanton slaughter against religious minorities. Horrors on a scale that defy description. Terrorism is a fundamental threat to religious freedom. It must be stopped, and it will be stopped. It may not be pretty for a little while. It will be stopped. (Applause.) We have seen -- and, by the way, General, as you know, James ""Mad Dog"" -- I shouldnt say it in this room -- Mattis. Now, there's a reason they call him ""Mad Dog Mattis"" -- he never lost a battle. Always wins them and always wins them fast. He's our new Secretary of Defense who will be working with Rex. He's right now in South Korea, going to Japan, going to some other spots. And I'll tell you what, I've gotten to know him really well. He's the real deal. We have somebody who's the real deal working for us, and that's what we need. So, you watch. You just watch. (Applause.) Things will be different.We have seen peace-loving Muslims brutalized, victimized, murdered and oppressed by ISIS killers. We have seen threats of extermination against the Jewish people. We have seen a campaign of ISIS and genocide against Christians, where they cut off heads. Not since the Middle Ages have we seen that. We havent seen that, the cutting off of heads. Now they cut off their heads, they drown people in steel cages. Havent seen this -- I havent seen this. Nobody has seen this for many, many years.All nations have a moral obligation to speak out against such violence. All nations have a duty to work together to confront it and to confront it viciously, if we have to. So I want to express clearly today to the American people that my administration will do everything in its power to defend and protect religious liberty in our land. America must forever remain a tolerant society where all faiths are respected, and where all of our citizens can feel safe and secure. We have to feel safe and secure.In recent days, we have begun to take necessary action to achieve that goal. Our nation has the most generous immigration system in the world. But these are those and there are those that would exploit that generosity to undermine the values that we hold so dear. We need security. There are those who would seek to enter our country for the purpose of spreading violence or oppressing other people based upon their faith or their lifestyle. Not right. We will not allow a beachhead of intolerance to spread in our nation. You look all over the world and you see what's happening.So in the coming days, we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty, and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination. We want people to come into our nation, but we want people to love us and to love our values -- not to hate us and to hate our values. We will be a safe country. We will be a free country. And we will be a country where all citizens can practice their beliefs without fear of hostility or fear of violence. America will flourish as long as our liberty and, in particular, our religious liberty is allowed to flourish. (Applause.)America will succeed as long as our most vulnerable citizens -- and we have some that are so vulnerable -- have a path to success. And America will thrive as long as we continue to have faith in each other and faith in God. (Applause.)That faith in God has inspired men and women to sacrifice for the needy, to deploy to wars overseas, and to lock arms at home, to ensure equal rights for every man, woman and child in our land. It's that faith that sent the pilgrims across the oceans, the pioneers across the plains, and the young people all across America to chase their dreams. They are chasing their dreams. We are going to bring those dreams back. As long as we have God, we are never, ever alone. Whether it's the soldier on the night watch or the single parent on the night shift, God will always give us solace and strength and comfort.We need to carry on and to keep carrying on. For us here in Washington, we must never, ever stop asking God for the wisdom to serve the public according to his will. That's why -- (applause) -- thank you. That's why President Eisenhower and Senator Carlson had the wisdom to gather together 64 years ago to begin this truly great tradition. But that's not all they did together. Let me tell you the rest of the story. Just one year later, Senator Carlson was among the members of Congress to send to the President's desk a joint resolution that added ""under God"" to our Pledge of Allegiance. That's a great thing. (Applause.) Because that's what we are and that is what we will always be, and that is what our people want: one beautiful nation, under God. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)END9:30 A.M. EST",19884.91,-6.029999999998836,5636.2,-6.449999999999818,2280.85,1.2999999999997272
71,2017-02-02,"Memorandum: Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the Executive Order of January 30, 2017, Titled “Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs”","MEMORANDUM FOR: REGULATORY POLICY OFFICERS AT EXECUTIVE                     DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AND MANAGING                     AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OF CERTAIN AGENCIES                     AND COMMISSIONSFROM:  Dominic J. Mancini, Acting Administrator        Office of Information and Regulatory AffairsSUBJECT: Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the Executive Order of January 30, 2017, Titled Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory CostsI. General RequirementsThis interim guidance, in the form of Questions and Answers (Q&As), addresses the requirements in Section 2, Regulatory Cap for Fiscal Year 2017, of the Executive Order of January 30, 2017, titled Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs (EO). Specifically, the guidance explains, for purposes of implementing Section 2 in Fiscal Year 2017, the following requirements:Unless prohibited by law, whenever an executive department or agency . . . publicly proposes for notice and comment or otherwise promulgates a new regulation, it shall identify at least two existing regulations to be repealed. Sec. 2(a).For fiscal year 2017, . . .the heads of all agencies are directed that the total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, to be finalized this year shall be no greater than zero, unless otherwise required by law or consistent with advice provided in writing by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget . . . . Sec. 2(b).In furtherance of the requirement of subsection (a) of this section, any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations. Sec. 2(c).In general, executive departments and agencies (agencies) may comply with those requirements by issuing two deregulatory actions (described below) for each new significant regulatory action that imposes costs. The savings of the two deregulatory actions are to fully offset the costs of the new significant regulatory action.In addition, beginning immediately, agencies planning to issue one or more significant regulatory action on or before September 30, 2017, should for each such significant regulatory action:A reasonable period of time before the agency issues that action, identify two existing regulatory actions the agency plans to eliminate or propose for elimination on or before September 30, 2017; andFully offset the total incremental cost of such new significant regulatory action as of September 30, 2017.Please consult with your Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) Desk Officer if you have any particular questions regarding the applicability or interpretation of the EO not addressed in these Q&As. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plans to issue further guidance regarding the application of EO for Fiscal Years 2018 and beyond soon. In addition, OMB may revise these Q&As.Comments on this interim guidance should be provided to reducingregulation@omb.eop.gov by February 10, 2017.II. CoverageQ: Which new regulations are covered?A: The EOs requirements for Fiscal Year 2017 apply only to those significant regulatory actions, as defined in Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, an agency issues between noon on January 20 and September 30, 2017. This includes significant final regulations for which agencies issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking before noon on January 20, 2017. Significant guidance documents may also be covered (see below).Please continue to follow the standard significance determination process outlined in Executive Order 12866. Regulations that affect only other Federal agencies (and not the public); that are issued with respect to a military, national security, or foreign affairs function of the United States; and that are related to agency organization, management, or personnel are not subject to Section 2s requirements.Q: What about rules that implement Federal spending programs?A: In general, Federal spending rules that primarily cause income transfers from taxpayers to program beneficiaries (e.g., rules associated with Pell grants and Medicare spending) are considered transfer rules and are not covered by this EO. However, in cases where these rules impose requirements on non-Federal entities, such as reporting or recordkeeping, agencies would need to account for these costs. Please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer on these rules. See OMB Circular A-4 for a discussion of the distinction between transfers and costs generally.Q: Do Section 2s requirements apply to significant regulatory actions of independent agencies?A: No, the requirements of Section 2 apply only to those agencies required to submit significant regulatory actions to OIRA for review under EO 12866. Nevertheless, we encourage independent regulatory agencies to identify existing regulations that, if repealed or revised, would achieve cost savings that would fully offset the costs of new significant regulatory actions.Q: Are new guidance/interpretive documents covered?A: New significant guidance or interpretive documents will be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Consult with your OIRA Desk Officer before issuing new significant guidance or regulatory interpretations. Agencies should continue to adhere to OMBs 2007 Memorandum on Good Guidance Practices. As always, agencies should ensure that such documents are the appropriate vehicle for the particular policy goal, and that it is clear that compliance with any agency guidance is voluntary. Any cost savings claimed for guidance or other documents must be specific and verifiable.Q: Which existing regulatory actions, if repealed or revised, would be considered deregulatory actions, and thus qualify for savings?A: Any existing regulatory action that imposes costs and the repeal or revision of which will produce verifiable savings may qualify. Meaningful burden reduction through the repeal or streamlining of mandatory reporting, recordkeeping or disclosure requirements may also qualify. Agencies should also confirm that they will continue to achieve their regulatory objectives after the deregulatory action is undertaken. Please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer regarding information collections or other actions you believe should qualify as deregulatory actions under SectionQ: Do regulatory actions issued before January 20 that are vacated or remanded by a court after that date qualify for savings?A: Generally no, based on the presumption that a court determined these regulatory actions were issued, at least in part, with insufficient legal basis. There may be individual cases, however, where we would consider counting such savings, and specifically request comment on this topic. As one example, the agency may be directed by a court, under remand, to modify a rule through full notice and comment rulemaking, in order address particular issues.Q: Do regulatory actions overturned by subsequently enacted laws qualify for savings?A: Generally yes. We will consider Acts of Congress that overturn final regulatory actions, such as disapprovals of rules under the Congressional Review Act, to operate in a similar manner as agency deregulatory actions for the purposes of the requirements of Section 2 of the EO.III. Accounting QuestionsQ: How should costs be measured?A: Costs should be measured as the opportunity cost to society. OMB Circular A-4 defines this concept.Q: How should agencies account for deregulatory actions that do not outright repeal existing regulations but revise existing requirements to produce real cost savings?A: OMB will address deregulatory actions that continue to allow agencies to meet regulatory goals on a case-by-case basis. Purely deregulatory actions that confer only savings to all affected parties generally will not trigger the requirement under Section 2(a) for the agency to identify two existing regulatory actions to be repealed. However, if such deregulatory actions impose costs on individuals or entities, agencies will need to offset those costs.Q: Can effects such as future energy cost savings for rules that require the adoption of more energy efficient technologies be counted against the compliance costs of a regulatory action for purposes of Section 2(b) of the EO?A: In most circumstances, such effects would not be counted as offsets to costs according to OIRAs reporting conventions for benefit-cost analysis.Q: What about costs that occur over different time periods?A: All costs estimates should be annualized in accordance with OMB Circular A-4. While timing issues will be handled on a case-by-case basis, in general, the start and end points for the annualization of costs should be directly comparable across the new and corresponding repealed regulatory actions.Q: Can agencies use previously estimated costs from an original Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIA) in determining the cost savings generated by an eliminated regulatory action?A: In general, no. While the original RIA may have information that will be useful in calculating cost savings, the most current information available on projected cost savings (e.g., new information on the cost of operating compliance technologies) must be included to the extent feasible. Agencies are also strongly encouraged to use program evaluations and similar techniques to determine the actual cost and other effects of eliminating regulatory actions.Q: What costs of existing regulatory actions should be counted as cost savings from a deregulatory action?A: All costs that would have occurred after the effective date of the repeal of the existing regulatory action should be the basis for the cost savings estimate. This means, for example, that agencies should not count sunk costs.Q: How should costs that duplicate those in another regulatory action be addressed?A: In general, costs should be counted only once, in the regulatory action that imposes the legally binding requirement resulting in those costs. Exceptions should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with your OIRA Desk Officer.Q: How should agencies treat unquantified costs and cost savings?A: These will be handled on a case-by-case basis. As a general matter, the weight assigned to unquantified effects will depend on their significance and degree of certainty. See OMB Circular A-4 for more information on unquantified costs.IV. Process and Waiver QuestionsQ: Which significant regulatory actions might qualify for individual waivers?A: Emergencies addressing critical health, safety, or financial matters, or for some other compelling reason, may qualify for a waiver from some or all of the requirements of Section 2. Please submit requests for a waiver assessment to your OIRA Desk Officer prior to submitting the rule for OMB review under EO 12866.Note that Section 2(b) of EO applies unless otherwise required by law. Agencies may proceed with significant regulatory actions that need to be finalized in order to comply with an imminent statutory or judicial deadline even if they are not able to identify offsetting regulatory actions by the time of issuance. In the unlikely case where your agency believes other regulatory actions, which are not needed to comply with an imminent statutory or judicial deadline, are required by law, please consult with your OIRA Desk Officer. In all cases, however, agencies should identify additional regulatory actions to be repealed in order to offset the cost of the new significant regulatory action, even if such action is required by law.Q: Can regulatory and deregulatory actions be bundled in the same regulatory action?A: Yes, under certain circumstances. In practice, many regulatory actions can both impose new requirements and remove or streamline existing requirements on the same regulated entities and within the same regulatory program. In this case, the agency must clearly identify the specific provisions that are counted within the regulatory and deregulatory portion of the rules, and the costs and cost savings associated with each. The net cost impact (the difference between costs imposed and cost savings) of such rules will generally determine whether they are regulatory actions that need to be offset. Agencies, however, should avoid artificially bundling provisions that are not logically connected in a single regulatory action.Q: What must agencies do to identify existing regulatory actions to be repealed?A: At a minimum, the agency should identify all of the associated regulatory actions to be repealed, along with cost saving estimates, no later than the date of issuance of the corresponding new significant regulatory action. Agencies should confirm that they will continue to achieve their regulatory objectives (such as health or environmental protection). All of the regulatory actions slated for repeal but not yet finalized also must be included in the Unified Regulatory Agenda.Q: Do deregulatory actions have to be finalized before new regulatory actions can be finalized?A: Per Section 2(a), each agency must identify two existing regulatory actions to be repealed. For many significant regulatory actions, the most appropriate place for such an identification is in the preamble of the rule being issued for notice and comment or promulgated. To the extent feasible, regulatory actions should be eliminated before or on the same schedule as the new regulatory action they offset. In cases where finalizing an offsetting regulation is not possible, agencies should provide a plan for finalizing the offsetting regulation. The most appropriate place for such a plan is the preamble of the rule being issued. The plan should include a commitment to include the offsetting regulation in the next addition of the Unified Regulatory Agenda, with dates for any required regulatory actions and estimates of the associated cost savings.Q: How does this EO interact with other EOs and guidance addressing regulatory activities?A: All requirements under other EOs and implementing guidance (e.g., EO 12866 and OMB Circular A-4) remain applicable.Q: Can savings be transferred within an agency?A: Yes. The requirements of this EO apply agency-wide. Regulatory savings by a component in one agency can be used to offset a regulatory burden by a different component in that same agency.Q: Can savings be transferred from other agencies?A: Agencies that are not able to generate sufficient savings to account for new regulatory actions they must issue may submit a written request to the Director of OMB to transfer savings from another agency before they submit a regulatory action for review that does not contain the needed offset. However, if the Director does not concur with this request, the Agency must identify adequate offsets absent a waiver.Q: How does the regulatory cost cap in Section 2 of the EO affect the consideration of regulatory benefits or other requirements under EO 12866?A: The regulatory cost cap has no effect on the requirements of EO 12866 or the consideration of regulatory benefits in making regulatory decisions. The goal of the requirement to eliminate two existing regulatory actions for each new significant regulatory action is to provide a mechanism for agencies to identify and repeal outdated, ineffective, or unnecessary regulatory actions. Similar to fiscal spending caps, the goal of the regulatory cost cap is to provide a mechanism for the prudent management and control of regulatory costs imposed on society by agencies attempting to achieve regulatory benefits.",19884.91,-6.029999999998836,5636.2,-6.449999999999818,2280.85,1.2999999999997272

73,2017-02-02,Remarks by President Trump Before Meeting with Harley-Davidson Executives and Union Representatives,"Roosevelt Room1:11 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: So it's great to have Harley-Davidson. What a great, great group of people and what a fantastic job you do. And thank you for all of the votes you gave me in Wisconsin. Some people thought that was an upset; I thought we were going to win it. From the beginning, we thought we were going to win it.Harley-Davidson is a true American icon, one of the greats. Your motorcycles have carried American servicemembers in the war -- in the wars. They take care of our police officers. And I see it so often -- whenever I go -- whenever there's a motorcycle group, oftentimes it's a Harley. And the sound of that Harley is a little different, I have to tell you. It's really good. So thank you, Harley-Davidson, for building things in America. And I think you're going to even expand -- I know your business is now doing very well and there's a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren't having so much in the last number of months that you have right now. You see what's happening.I'm especially honored to welcome the steelworkers and the machinists to the White House.Who is a steelworker here? Well, you're all steelworkers, essentially, right? But you folks have been terrific to me. Sometimes your top people didn't support me but the steelworkers supported me, right? A lot of your top people are going to be losing their jobs pretty soon I guess but they're all coming around -- we're getting them. But the workers supported us big league. We want to make it easier for businesses to create more jobs and more factories in the United States, and you're a great example of it. That means we have to make America the best country on Earth to do business, and that's what we're in the process of doing -- we're redoing NAFTA, redoing a lot of our trade deals, and we're negotiating properly with countries -- even countries that are allies -- a lot of people taking advantage of us, a lot of countries taking advantage of us, really terribly taking advantage of us.We had one instance in Australia -- I have a lot of respect for Australia, I love Australia as a country -- but we had a problem where, for whatever reason, President Obama said that they were going to take probably well over a thousand illegal immigrants who were in prisons and they were going to bring them and take them into this country. And I just said why? I just wanted to ask a question -- I could ask that question of you -- why? One thousand-two-hundred-fifty -- it could be 2,000, it could be more than that, and I said, why? Why are we doing this? What's the purpose? So we'll see what happens. But a previous administration does something, you have to respect that, but you can also say, why are we doing this? That's why we're in the jams that we're in. And you guys especially, the steelworkers, understand what I'm saying, right? So I just -- we have some wonderful allies and we're going to keep it that way, but we have to be treated fairly also. We have to be treated fairly. In this administration, our allegiance will be to the American workers and to American businesses, like Harley-Davidson, that were very strong in the 1980s and I remember this -- you were victims of trading abuse -- big trading abuse, where they were dumping all sorts of competitors all over the place. And Ronald Reagan stepped in and he put on large tariffs and you wouldn't be talking about Harley-Davidson probably right now if he didn't do that. But we're going to help you, too, and we're going to make it really great for business -- not just you, but for everybody. We're going to be competitive with anybody in the world. We're going to be doing taxing policies very soon it's going to be coming out. And I know health care is a big problem for every country -- every company as you know has suffered from Obamacare because of the tremendous cost and that's one of the things that we're working on hardest -- that and tax policy, and tariffs and trade.So I think you will be very happy. It's an honor to have you at lunch. I really appreciate your support. You've given me tremendous support, your workers in particular have given tremendous support. I want to thank the people of Wisconsin in particular. It's been amazing what happened up there. It was a big shocker that evening when they showed -- wow -- I'll never forget, wow, Wisconsin just went for Trump. Then all of these people, especially that guy right there -- (laughter) -- not but then they said, what's going on? Wisconsin just went for Trump. And then Michigan went for Trump and Pennsylvania. So they were great. You're just great people. These are amazing people and they get it. So, again, to all of you at the table today, thank you very much. We appreciate it. We really appreciate it greatly.Q  Mr. President, is military action off the table in Iran?THE PRESIDENT: Nothing is off the table.Q  Mr. President, the Russians are thanking you for easing sanctions.THE PRESIDENT: I haven't eased anything. Q  That's what they said.THE PRESIDENT: Well, I haven't eased anything.END1:16 P.M. EST",19884.91,-6.029999999998836,5636.2,-6.449999999999818,2280.85,1.2999999999997272
74,2017-02-03,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/3/2017, #8","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room12:37 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. Happy Friday. It's another busy day here at the White House and across the Trump administration. The first jobs report under the President's administration was released this morning. It's National Wear Red Day, highlighting the importance of preventing heart disease. It's National Catholic Schools Week. And the President is going to be signing some executive orders, delivering some much-needed regulatory relief to lenders and borrowers in the next few minutes.We're finishing up the second week here really strong. Yesterday, another great deal was reached with Lockheed Martin for the purchase of a new lot of F35s. Through the Presidents intervention, a total of 90 planes -- for a lot of 90 planes; 55 were purchased for U.S. military that added up to a total of $455 million savings for U.S. taxpayers from the previous lot, with an average cost reduction of 7.5 percent, another big win that the President has delivered on for U.S. taxpayers.Speaking of good numbers, lets turn to the jobs report. The economy added more than 227,000 new jobs, significantly more than the 175,000 that had been expected. Todays report reflects the consumer confidence that the Trump presidency has inspired. According to a recent Gallup poll, economic confidence is at a new high, and ADP showed strong private sector hiring. President Trump campaigned on how to make America work again. Even before he took office, the markets knew he would deliver on that promise. The President has already taken significant steps to turn our economy around, and hes looking forward to ensuring that every American who wants a job has the opportunity to find one.While the President is definitely pleased that the job growth has far surpassed expectations and that the labor force participation is rising, he also recognizes that theres a lot more work to be done. The President has a big and bold agenda to grow the U.S. economy and to create jobs. In just his first two weeks in office, hes met with more than 50 business leaders across a vast range of industries. This morning, the President participated in a strategic and policy forum with business leaders from some of our countrys most successful companies. The President understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders on how to make the nations economy stronger. His firsthand experience as a successful businessman helps to guide his decisions as President, and he will continue to seek opinions of other job creators while crafting an economic agenda.All of these meetings are focused on one primary goal: providing new and improved employment opportunities for all Americans. Were looking at a full range of policy measures to achieve that goal: regulatory relief, tax and trade reform, empowering women in the workplace, rebuilding Americas crumbling infrastructure, and improving our education system. Also today, in pursuit of that goal, the President will be signing two executive actions as part of his plan to overhaul our financial and regulatory system. I expect that to happen closer to the one o'clock hour. The first is an executive order for posing guideline principles that sets the table for a regulatory system that mitigates risk, encourages growth, and more importantly, protects consumers. The Dodd-Frank Act is a disastrous policy thats hindering our markets, reducing the availability of credit, and crippling our economys ability to grow and create jobs. It imposed hundreds of new regulations on financial institutions while establishing unaccountable and unconstitutional new agency that does not adequately protect consumers. Perhaps worst of all, despite all of its overreaching, Dodd-Frank did not address the causes of the financial crisis, something we all know must be done. It did not solve the ""too big to fail,"" and we must determine conclusively that the failure of a large bank will never again leave taxpayers on the hook.The presidential memorandum addresses the burdens of government regulations and the Department of Labors fiduciary rule. The rule is a solution in search of a problem. There are better ways to protect investors, and the Trump administration is taking action to do so. Were directing the Department of Labor to review this rule. The rules intent may be to have provided retirees and others with better financial advice, but in reality, its effect has been to limit the financial services that are available to them.President Trump does not intend to put unnecessary limits on economic opportunity. The Department of Labor exceeded its authority with this rule, and this is exactly the kind of government regulatory overreach the President was put into office to stop. We desperately need to overhaul how we approach financial regulation. The President is taking action to protect American taxpayers and get people back to work.Moving on, we announced earlier this week that we would be taking steps to address Irans recent actions. Today, the U.S. sanctioned 25 individuals and entities that provide support to Irans ballistic missile program and the Islamic Revolutionary Quds Force. These designations are in response to Irans ongoing ballistic missile program, including its ballistic missile test on January 29, 2017, as well as Irans continued support for terrorism. Weve taken these actions today, after careful consideration, and will continue to respond with appropriate action.These designations mark yet another stop in our continued effort to aggressively target Irans ballistic missile program and terrorism-related activities. Over at the Department of Defense, Secretary Mattis is on the final day of a two-day trip through Asia. He visited Korea yesterday and Japan today, returning to Washington tomorrow. Secretary Mattiss visit emphasizes the priority President Trump places on the Asia-Pacific, and on strengthening the U.S.-Republic of Korea alliance in the face of a growing North Korea nuclear and ballistic missile threat.Over in the Senate, the President now has 11 Cabinet nominees awaiting a full Senate vote on their confirmations. We look forward to welcoming these individuals into the administration.Regarding the weekends plans, the President will debut his second weekly Facebook Live event this evening at 5 oclock. You can expect him to recap another week of action on behalf of the American people. Hell also comment on his selection of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. And while recognizing Black History Month, he will discuss his vision to deliver more opportunity and safety for the African-American community.One more note of this weeks address: the lead-in to the Presidents remark on Facebook Live will feature some of the incredible artwork throughout the White House that was created by African American artists, so you definitely dont want to miss this.As I mentioned previously, this weekend the President will be shifting the operation of the White House down to the Winter White House at Mar-a-Lago. While in Florida, hell hold meetings and calls with advisors and staff to plan for another big week of action on behalf of the American people. Well provide readouts of these as they occur. By our count, as of this morning the administration has already racked up more than 60 significant actions: 21 executive actions, 16 meetings with foreign leaders, and 10 stakeholder meetings, to name a few. Were looking forward to another productive week next week.On Monday, the President will visit Central Command and Special Operations Command Headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base.While at MacDill, the President will receive command briefings from both CENTCOM and SOCOM, have lunch with the enlisted troops, and have an all-hands address to personnel. General Dunford and General Flynn will also be present for the meetings, and the President will return to Washington that evening.With that, Im going to go my first Skype question seat.  Jackie Nespral from NBC 6 in South Florida. Jackie.Q  Good afternoon. On behalf of the viewers of South Florida, thanks so much for this opportunity. You know, a lot of focus on foreign affairs this week, a new sanctions announced today against Iran, and of course Miami, as you know, is home to the largest Cuban-American community in the country. And during the campaign, President Trump talked about his discontent with the warming of U.S.-Cuba relations implemented by President Obama. And in the last days of his administration, he ended the ""wet foot, dry foot"" policy, leaving thousands of Cubans in limbo.So my question is twofold. A, has there been any contact between your administration and the Cuban government? And B, are there any plans to change the current policy right now?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Jackie. We are in the midst of a full review of all U.S. policies towards Cuba. The President is committed to an agenda of ensuring human rights for all citizens throughout the world. And as we review those policies in Cuba, that will be forefront in their policy discussions, but there is nothing that we have on that front at this point.Francesca Chambers.Q  Thank you, Sean. Today, the United States put new sanctions on Iran. Previously, this morning, the President had said that they were playing with fire. You said that appropriate actions would continue to be taken. Is this the full extent of the punishing actions that were seeing right now? And are military options still on the table in response to the administration saying that all options are on the table?MR. SPICER: Thanks for the question. I think one of the things that the President has said throughout the campaign, during the transition, and since becoming President is that he doesnt like to telegraph his options. Thats how he believes that you can have a much greater successful option. So Im not going to go into the full extent, and I think todays sanctions really represent a very, very strong stand against the actions that Iran has been taking and make it very clear that the deal that they struck previously was not in the best interest of this country, and that President Trump is going to do everything he can to make sure that Iran is stayed in check.Q  So it is possible that there are more actions coming, though?MR. SPICER: I just -- I would never rule anything off the table. I think the President has made it clear throughout his time that thats what going to happen.Jeff.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. I wanted to ask about one of the members that has been announced as being part of President Trumps team -- it's Gina Haspel. Senator Ron Wyden has written to the President saying that her background makes her unsuitable to be the CIA Deputy Director. And what he was specifically referencing was her role in the enhanced interrogation program that the CIA had during the course of the Bush administration. Do you believe that this background is a disqualifier for that position?MR. SPICER: I think she has had an unbelievably distinguished career as a covert operative. She basically gave up that to come out and serve in this role at the request of Director Pompeo, and I think she has been a very, very distinguished servant to the American people and is highly qualified for that position.Next, I'm going to go to Josh McElveen over at -- from WMUR in New Hampshire.Q  Hey, Sean, thanks for taking the question. I know you're looking forward to the Patriots coming down in a couple of months -- a lot of people up here are hoping that happens as well. Getting to business, though, for more than two years, the number-one public health and safety threat facing this state is the heroin and opioid crisis. During the campaign, the President promised to be swift and aggressive when it came to this problem -- stopping the flow of drugs coming across the border. Increasingly, though, the problem lies in synthetic fentanyl being cooked up in labs in the northeast. What is the administration doing on that front as well as the treatment aspect of addiction? And secondly, if I may, with the understanding it is a state issue, New Hampshire is poised to become a ""right to work"" state, but the vote is expected to be close. Given the administration's favorable view of ""right to work,"" is it actively engaged in that effort? And if not, what is the general message from the White House?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Josh. First, on the opioid crisis, that is a major problem for not just New Hampshire but for so many states across the country. I think one of the things beyond the health issue is to make sure that we're looking at borders use. And the flow of heroin through our southern border is something that the President obviously takes -- that's part of his whole strong immigration stance, strong border security, having that wall built, having additional assets on the southern border will go a long way to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the country from our southern border up through the states.It was obviously, as you mentioned, a big issue that he made in New Hampshire throughout the primary and continued so on the campaign. And that's something that as soon as Tom Price and others are confirmed throughout the department, this has got a health component to it, it's got a border issue to it. So there is a multi-government approach that needs to be taken to the opioid crisis. With respect to right to work, I think you accurately portrayed it. The President believes in right to work. He wants to give workers and companies the flexibility to do what's in the best interest for job creators. Obviously, the Vice President has been a champion of this as well. It's something that is a big deal in Indiana and something that he has championed as well.Blake.Q  Sean, I want to ask you about Dodd-Frank. Beyond the executive order that's going to be signed here momentarily, is the administration planning on or working with Congress to overturn certain portions of the law itself that can be done with an executive order? If so, what might that be? What might that timeline be? And can you say if a full repeal of Dodd-Frank is actively being considered or not?MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's two aspects of this. There's the administrative piece, which he's starting to address through executive action, and then there's a legislative piece that I think we're going to work with Congress on. But I mean, I think I'd go back to what I said earlier -- that Dodd-Frank has been both a disaster in terms of the impact that it's had, but also it hasn't achieved the goal. And I think that there's no question that the President talked about this extensively, the impact that it's had. And it's not an either-or. It's, frankly, just not doing what it set out to do. And so I think we're going to continue not just to act through administrative action, but through working with Congress and figuring out a legislative fix.Major Garrett.Q  Sean, meeting with the Australian ambassador here yesterday with Chief of Staff Priebus and Steve Bannon -- can you describe what that meeting was about? And did the administration make a commitment -- which we heard from the State Department yesterday -- that, in fact, all of those subject to the Obama administration agreement are still possible refugee re-settlers just with extreme vetting or some sort of process? What was communicated? And on the Iran sanctions, Adam Szubin is the Acting Treasury Secretary. He was, of course, in charge of sanctions at the Treasury Department before. Oftentimes these are a long time in development. Were these sanctions something that were kind of on his desk or have been identified, and that's what made them so, if not easy, available to enact so rapidly?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think those are -- I think you correctly pointed out -- I mean, he served in the last administration. These kind of sanctions don't happen quickly, but I think the timing of them was clearly in reaction to what we've seen over the last couple days. We knew we had these options available to us because they had been worked through the process, but we acted swiftly and decisively today because the timing was right. So they were in the pipeline, they had been staffed and approved, and the President made the decision that now was the time to do it based on recent action.Chief of Staff Priebus and Chief Strategist Bannon did meet with the Prime Minister yesterday. I think they had a very productive --Q  The ambassador.MR. SPICER: The ambassador. Thank you. Appreciate the correction. They did have a very productive and candid conversation. We have a tremendous amount of respect for the people of Australia, for Prime Minister Turnbull, and it was a follow-up on the call. But we're going to continue to work through this. We're going to honor the commitments that we've made in some way, meaning that we are going to vet these people in accordance with the agreement that happened. And we'll continue to have further updates as we do.John Roberts.Q  Sean, your statement last night on settlements in Israel -- has there been a shift in U.S. policy? While you said that you didn't think that they were helpful to achieving peace, you also didn't think that they were an impediment to peace, which would represent a departure from both Obama and Bush. And there was no reaffirmation of a two-state solution in that statement. So where are you on that?MR. SPICER: The President is committed to peace. That's his goal. And I think when the President and Prime Minister Netanyahu meet here on the 15th, that will obviously be the topic on that. At the end of the day, the goal is peace. And I think that's what you have to keep in mind. I think that is going to be a subject that they discuss when they meet on the 15th, and that's as far as I want to go on that.Q  Sean, back to the settlement thing. What is your position on settlements in terms of whether or not they -- I mean, you said that they were not an impediment to peace, but you also don't want them building new ones. MR. SPICER: Right.Q  So where are you --MR. SPICER: I mean, I think the statement is very clear about that. We don't believe that the existence of current settlements is an impediment to peace, but I think the construction or expansion of existing settlements beyond the current borders is not going to be helpful moving forward.Trey.Q  Two for you. Seventeen members of Congress requested that President Trump not interfere with the current way unemployment is calculated by the Department of Labor. Does the President intend to comply with their request? And a related question -- how many of the 227,000 jobs added to the U.S. in January does the President attribute to his administration versus the Obama administration?MR. SPICER: I think, look, when you look at the confidence indexes, I'm not going to get into -- unfortunately, we don't have that kind of a breakdown. I think that you've seen the actions that he's taken, whether it's Carrier or some of the other companies -- Sprint, SoftBank. Clearly there is a desire for companies to want to come be part of this Trump agenda and build and manufacture, create jobs, bring jobs back. But I'm not at liberty to start parsing the BLS and other reports as far as where that comes down. But look, his team, led by Gary Cohn, was really pleased with the numbers this morning. Obviously, we're pleased that we're -- 227,000 jobs is a great kickoff. We hope they get better. We know that there's a lot more work to do, and that's why the President continues to meet with business leaders, union leaders to help figure out how we can grow the economy.Ashley.Q  The government revealed in an Alexandria court case today that over 100,000 visas have now been revoked as part of the President's travel ban. Does that include visa holders who are already in the United States? And will the government begin finding them and trying to deport them?MR. SPICER: I'll have to get back to you on that. I don't have all the details on that right now.Q  Six hours ago, the President tweeted that professional anarchists, thugs and paid protestors are proving the point of millions of people who voted to make America great again. Does the administration have any intention of investigating the groups who have been rioting at conservative or pro-Trump events?MR. SPICER: I think we know who they are. I don't know that we need to do an investigation.Q  Has the President seen the letter sent from Senator McCain yesterday? And if so, is he looking into arming the Ukrainians?MR. SPICER: I don't know. I'll have to get back to you on that.Charlie.Q  Ambassador Nikki Haley came out with a strong statement on Russia yesterday. Does the administration have plans to keep the sanctions against Russia in place, or do they have any intention of adding more sanctions?MR. SPICER: So there's two things. One, I think I commented the other day on the sanctions that Treasury put out. Those are, in fact, routine -- or the clarification -- they are a routine clarification that occurs. With respect to the sanctions, I think Ambassador Haley made it very clear of our concern with Russia's occupation of Crimea. We are not -- and so I think she spoke very forcefully and clearly on that.If I can, I'd like to go to the third Skype question. Christopher Sign from ABC15 in Arizona.Q  Sean, thank you for doing this. Hello from a sunny and beautiful Phoenix. With the likely confirmation on the horizon with a new Veteran Affairs Secretary, there has been discussion regarding privatizing the VA. There's also still concerns regarding wait times, even overall care and some reports regarding a suicide rate. What is the reform that the administration is seeking here? Also, will the administration protect whistleblowers? Second part of the question -- we've seen protests here in Phoenix, as in the nationwide as well. When you talk about unity, what is the administration doing to bring more unity to the nation, and even more transparency? As here in Phoenix, we saw that secret meeting on the tarmac. How is the administration repairing all of this?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Chris. First, I mean, I think the President, mostly through deed, continues to show that he wants to bring people together in this country, figure out how to move the country forward, both economically, job-wise. I think that is something that he continues to show a desire for. He talked about it in his inaugural address and the prayer breakfast. So I think he's going to continue to show through both word and deed his desire to move the country forward. I'm trying to think -- can you go back to the first part?Q  That's all right -- the confirmation -- the likely confirmation of the VA Secretary. MR. SPICER: Oh yeah, Dr. Shulkin. Yeah, look, I think first and foremost on VA reform, the number one thing is to get Dr. Shulkin confirmed. And so many of these, as I brought up in the past couple days, it's hard to talk about how we're going to enact an agenda of reform when Senate Democrats continue to slow-walk some of these folks. And I think that's a big problem. Dr. Shulkin is the right individual to reform the VA -- to understand whether it's lending or medical care, the problems and the challenges that we face at the VA. These are people who have served our nation and deserve the best care they can get, whether that's the mortgage lending, health care, or the variety of other stuff that the VA serves or provides to our veterans. And I think that what the President has done is talk to people like Dr. Toby Cusgrove at Cleveland Clinic and other business leaders about providing a better approach to serving the needs of our veterans. Right now, you're right, there are still wait times that are unacceptable. There's care that's unacceptable. We've got to address that, and he's going to continue to do it.David Jackson.Q  Sean, during the campaign, candidate Trump repeatedly said he was going to void the Iranian nuclear deal. Bottom line -- is he going to do that, or is he going to let it stay?MR. SPICER: I think today's action speaks for itself in terms of the sanctions. He's made it very, very clear, David, that the deal that was struck was a bad deal, that we gave Iran too much and we got too little for it. And I think that he is going to continue to be tough on Iran in a way that wasnt done in the last eight years. I think today's actions and the way that we expedited those sanctions are another example of how he's going to stay tough on them.Let me go to the fourth Skype seat. Dale Jackson from WVNN Talk Radio in Huntsville, Alabama.Q  Sean, thank you very much for taking questions from outside the elite media bubble there in D.C. My question is about immigration. Donald Trump made this the forefront of his campaign, the foundation of it, yet the DACA and DAPA programs still exist. And I learned from a member of Congress yesterday that the Trump administration is still issuing the work permits that (inaudible) individuals. Question one is, when are these programs going to be ended?  And question two, when will they stop issuing work permits to these individuals?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Dale. I think as you know, Secretary Kelly just assumed office. We are reviewing these programs. We've made it very clear that we'll have further updates on immigration referring to DACA and DAPA. The President has made significant progress on addressing the pledge that he made to the American people regarding immigration problems that we face, and I think we're going to see more action on that in the next few weeks. Yes, sir.Q  Sean, yesterday the President described NAFTA as a catastrophe. We've heard about his concerns with Mexico, but I'm wondering if you can outline some of the irritants that he finds along the Canadian border, and if there's any talk of a meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau.MR. SPICER: I think he has spoken to Prime Minister Trudeau. I know that they're looking at setting up a time to come down. We've been in constant contact with Canadian officials, and I think that will be a meeting that is set up very shortly.Sarah.Q  Thanks, Sean. Russia's foreign minister has pressed the administration for further details on the President's plans to establish safe zones in Syria. The President has said to have discussed this yesterday with King Abdullah. When can we expect further details on that plan?MR. SPICER: That's a good question. I think that we are -- as you noted in the readouts from last weekend, that has been a subject that has come up with all of the Middle East leaders that he's talked about. It's an area that he feels strongly about. And I think as he continues to have follow-up conversations, we can expect further details. It's something that -- Secretary Tillerson obviously just got sworn into office, -- that there will be further follow-up on that.Yeah.Q  The President will meet with Japanese Prime Minister Abe next Friday.MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  So what's the main topic for the meeting? Will the President tell Japanese Prime Minister Abe that Japan should pay more and pick up all the expense (inaudible) in Japan?MR. SPICER: I think there's going to be a lot of both trade and national security. I think as we get closer to that meeting, I'll have further information on it. But right now, as you can imagine, there's an economic aspect to this, and then there's a national security aspect to this. Glenn.Q  Sean, you have referenced polls a couple of times from the podium, but a poll came out today. CBS says the President has a 40 percent approval rating. We've seen the approval rating drop during the transition period. He talked about polls a great deal during the campaign. A, what do you think that says about the way the American people are looking at these actions that he's taking? And, B, what do you think it says about his pledge to unite the country on the eve of his election?MR. SPICER: I think there's also a Rasmussen poll that showed he had a 51 percent approval rating. You had an Ipsos/Reuters poll that other day that showed -- and again, I dont have it handy, but a majority of people approved --Q  (Inaudible) those. MR. SPICER: I understand that. And I think that as the President's policies continue to get enacted, for all the hysteria regarding his efforts to protect the country, on those seven countries where we didnt have the proper vetting in place to ensure that the American people were safe, what we did have was a very high response from the American people in support of that. His policies continue to do it. The President understands this is a marathon, and not a sprint. And as he continues to get people back to work, protect this country, I think the poll numbers will act in accord.Q  Sean, you mentioned the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Does the administration intend to keep Richard Cordray as the head of that agency?MR. SPICER: I dont have a staff announcement on the CFPB right now, but we'll see where we go.Q  You criticize the bureau broadly, but do you want to see it stay in place?MR. SPICER: I think we'll have further updates on that. That's an area that we need to work with Congress on.April.Q  Okay, Sean, two things. One, you said something about President Trump talking on the Facebook Live that he was going to talk about Black History Month and issues pertaining to the African American community. When you first came, a couple days into the administration, I asked you about the agenda, the black agenda that he had possibly formulated or he was formulating as he came out maybe the day before with the issue of Chicago, or the day after -- something around that time -- Chicago and sending the Feds in if it doesnt change. Has he now formulated a plan to deal with the black community, not just with issues of law and order? What is that --MR. SPICER: I mean, he had a meeting with African American leaders the other day in the Roosevelt Room. I think part of this is, to your point, it isnt just law and order -- it's jobs, it's education, it's health care, small business lending. There's a lot that goes along with that agenda. And I think part of these business meetings they have are about hiring and small business and job creation. All of those issues, I think, are at the forefront of small business -- or that community. So it's not just a single thing. I think that there's a lot, whether it's crime and law and order, or education, health care, small business, job creation. That impacts that entire segment of the population, whether they're living in a rural part of the country or an inner city. And I think that's what he's really focused on right now. Q  Sean --Q  Wait, I'm not finished. So he's now formulating the agenda?MR. SPICER: Absolutely.Q  Okay. So the second question -- CVE. What's on the table for that? MR. SPICER: We're not getting -- I have nothing to announce on that right now.Q  You have nothing to announce, but people are concerned --MR. SPICER: I understand people. I understand we've heard a lot of rumors about what may or may not. When we have something to announce on that, we will do it. But I dont think it should be any surprise that the President, when it comes to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism, which is what that initially was supposed to be focused on, he is going to make sure that that is a major focus of his -- keeping this country safe. And so I dont have anything further for you on that. I'm just --Q  What about excluding people -- there are reports about excluding white supremacists from --MR. SPICER: There are a reports. I dont have anything for you. I just said I dont have anything for you, but I will be very clear that this President's commitment to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism is something that is at the forefront of his agenda. And I know that there's been a lot of reports about where that program or that effort is going to lie.Q  Is there going to be any kind of target on the issues of white supremacy?MR. SPICER: I have nothing else. Thank you, April.Cecilia.Q  Sean, thank you. The President has been using some tough talk, tough language on Iran -- ""playing with fire."" Should Americans be ready for the possibility of military action with Iran? Is that on the table?MR. SPICER: Look, I've said this before, the President has been very clear: He doesnt take options off the table but he understands the impact of something like that. The sanctions today I think are going to be very, very strong and impactful. And I hope that Iran realizes that after the provocative measures that they've taken, that they understand that this President and this administration is not going to sit back and take it lightly. John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. On Monday, several published reports saying that it will be a tie in the Senate on the confirmation of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education, and Mike Pence will have to cast a historic tie-breaking vote as Vice President. Should we be watching for any surprises? Has the Congressional Affairs Office perhaps gotten one more vote from the ""no"" camp into the ""yes""? Or do you expect the Vice President to be on hand to confirm her?MR. SPICER: Look, I would say this: Betsy DeVos, as I mentioned before, is an unbelievable champion of education -- for children, for teachers, for parents. I hope that that vote gets 60, 70 votes. She is an unbelievable, remarkable woman who has fought very hard to improve our nation's education system and to make sure that schools are serving children. And I think that we are going to make sure we do everything we can, and we feel 100 percent confident that she will be confirmed Monday night and be the next Secretary of Education.Thank you, guys. Have a great weekend. The President is about to sign executive orders. I hope you all have a great weekend. To those of you who can't travel down to Florida, we'll be gaggling on the plane on Monday. Thank you. Have a great weekend. END1:07 P.M. EST#8-02/03/2017",20071.46,186.54999999999927,5666.77,30.57000000000062,2297.42,16.570000000000164

As part of this examination, you shall prepare an updated economic and legal analysis concerning the likely impact of the Fiduciary Duty Rule, which shall consider, among other things, the following:(i) Whether the anticipated applicability of the Fiduciary Duty Rule has harmed or is likely to harm investors due to a reduction of Americans' access to certain retirement savings offerings, retirement product structures, retirement savings information, or related financial advice;(ii) Whether the anticipated applicability of the Fiduciary Duty Rule has resulted in dislocations or disruptions within the retirement services industry that may adversely affect investors or retirees; and(iii) Whether the Fiduciary Duty Rule is likely to cause an increase in litigation, and an increase in the prices that investors and retirees must pay to gain access to retirement services.(b) If you make an affirmative determination as to any of the considerations identified in subsection (a)-or if you conclude for any other reason after appropriate review that the Fiduciary Duty Rule is inconsistent with the priority identified earlier in this memorandum-then you shall publish for notice and comment a proposed rule rescinding or revising the Rule, as appropriate and as consistent with law.Sec. 2.

79,2017-02-03,Remarks by President Trump in Strategy and Policy Forum,"State Dining Room10:16 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, everybody, for being here this morning. This is a really world-class group and I want to thank and congratulate Steve. You have done, as usual, an amazing job. Steve called me up the day after the election -- it might have even been the same night, Jamie, to be honest with you. You know Steve -- (inaudible) -- in fact, I think maybe one minute. And he said, I'd like to put together a group of world-class leaders and that's what he's done. So good job, Steve. A couple of things happened this morning -- 227,000 jobs, great spirit in the country right now. So we're very happy about that. I think that it's going to continue big league. We're bringing back jobs, we're bringing down your taxes. We're getting rid of your regulations. And I think it's going to be some really very exciting times ahead. We're going to be doing -- we're doing it, we're going to be coming up with a tax bill soon, a health care bill even sooner. And it's really working out. Toby from the Cleveland Clinic has been helping us a lot with the veterans, and we appreciate that, Toby. You've been amazing. And I and all of our friends, we really appreciate it.One of the things that I heard this morning in watching the news was that, amazingly, it's never happened before, that politics has become a much bigger subject than the Super Bowl -- this is usually Super Bowl territory. And I have to say that politics is more interesting to people. So that's good. I see we have Larry here -- where is Larry Fink? Larry did a great job for me. He managed a lot of my money, and, I have to tell you, he got me great returns last year. (Laughter.) And then they go crazy -- they'll meet very smart people that made money, why don't you let other people to run the economy? I said, no, we have to get the right people. And the people that voted for me understand that, and that's what they want.So when I campaigned for office, I promised the American people that I'd ask for our country's best and brightest, and we have that. Wilbur is representing us as secretary. I tell you, you're going to be so great -- Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross. In fact, Carl Icahn got called up, and he goes, I hear you got Wilbur. Everybody calls him Wilbur. I've never heard him called -- what, we just know him as Wilbur, right? We've got the great Jack Welch, the legendary Jack Welch. We appreciate him.We're looking forward in a little while, and we have coming in a few moments, to discuss all of the things that you think we can do to bring back our jobs, to get taxes even lower than what they'll be cutting them. We have a great plan, but I want to have your input on the plan in particular and to do what we have to do in terms of regulation. We have some of the bankers here. Theres nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie, so youre going to tell me about it. But we expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank, because, frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine that have nice businesses that cant borrow money, they just cant get any money because the banks just wont let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank. So well be talking about that, Jamie, in terms of the banking industry.And with that, I just want to introduce somebody Ive known for a long time. Hes done a fantastic job, and were thinking of have these meetings -- I think well start maybe on a monthly basis. It will go to a quarterly basis, because all of a sudden monthly basis sounds like a lot.But we really want your input. We have the biggest, the brightest in the world. Theyre in this country, in this case. We also have a manufacturing group which is worldwide, where we have, as you know, great companies representing. But these are the biggest and the best minds in this country, and I really appreciate you being here. And I want to thank Steve. And Steve is going to say a few words.MR. SCHWARZMAN: Sure. Well, Id like to just start out and thank everybody for being here. The purpose of this group isnt for general discussion, which is okay. But the real purpose is to get things done, to advise the government as to areas where we can do things a lot better as a country, for all Americans, and de-bottleneck some things.We have a full agenda, unlike a lot of other meetings that happen of this general type. Were going to cover some of the immigration things. Were going to cover regulatory, I believe. Were going to cover tax and trade, women in the workplace, infrastructure and education. And in each of those areas we'll get suggestions, ways to make things happen, happen faster to improve the country.And anybody can say anything else they want. But its really important that we mobilize the non-governmental sector, and also, importantly, that we do it on a bipartisan basis. Apparently, a first in Washington for a (inaudible) Washington. And everybody on the group was selected because theyre terrific, because they have domain expertise, because they want the country to do better. And we had no criteria -- we have all kinds of different people from different backgrounds and different political persuasions. And if we can make things work right, thats the way the country is supposed to work.And so its a big sacrifice for the people who are here to spend the time. Everybody is busy. Thats America. So to puts those things aside to focus on this, not just for me, but theres prep work that goes into any successful meeting -- means these people who attended have taken the time to care about their country.And so thats the spirit in which were approaching things. I want to thank everybody on the committee here. You're terrific. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. We're going to go around the room, but before we do that I just want to say that so many people I call friends of mine in big business, and they wanted to be in the committee. And I call Steve and I say, Steve, can we get so-and-so? No. (Laughter.) I said, what do you mean no? (Laughter.) Its a big business, massive business -- you know, public companies. And every once in a while Id call him -- Steve, how about this one? I dont -- hes a corporate raider, these people dont want to be sitting with corporate raiders. (Laughter.) Five raiders that wanted to come. But hes been very, very selective. And well be putting a couple of more (inaudible). Hes been very selective. I thought we might go around the room -- Mary and I met last week, we had a fantastic meeting on the auto industry. We had Ford there, we had a lot of companies. We had some great companies -- Fiat-Chrysler, Sergio. And I will tell you, I learned a lot about the automobile business. I thought I knew a lot, but they are being so stymied, so restricted with regulation and so many other reasons, and theyre pouring back into the country already. If you look at Mark, who was telling us what theyre doing with Ford, and Bill Ford, too. A lot of jobs are going to be coming back into Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania, and all of the places that really have been hurt so badly.So maybe we can start with Mary. Well just go around the room real fast so that everybody -- pretty much everybody knows each other, but it would be nice to see.MS. BARRA: Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO of General Motors.MR.

82,2017-02-03,Statement by National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn on Iran,"Today, the United States sanctioned twenty-five individuals and entities that provide support to Irans ballistic missile program and to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force.The Islamic Republic of Iran is the worlds leading state sponsor of terrorism and engages in and supports violent activities that destabilize the Middle East. This behavior seems continuous despite the very favorable deal given to Iran by the Obama Administration. These sanctions target these behaviors.Irans senior leadership continues to threaten the United States and our allies. Since the Obama Administration agreed to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran in 2015, Irans belligerent and lawless behavior has only increased. Examples include the abduction of ten of our sailors and two patrol boats in January 2016, unwarranted harassment of vessel traffic and repeated weapons tests. Just this week, Iran tested a ballistic missile, and one of its proxy terrorist groups attacked a Saudi vessel in the Red Sea.The international community has been too tolerant of Irans bad behavior. The ritual of convening a United Nations Security Council in an emergency meeting and issuing a strong statement is not enough. The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Irans provocations that threaten our interests.The days of turning a blind eye to Irans hostile and belligerent actions toward the United States and the world community are over.",20071.46,186.54999999999927,5666.77,30.57000000000062,2297.42,16.570000000000164

85,2017-02-06,Remarks by President Trump to Coalition Representatives and Senior U.S. Commanders,"MacDill Air Force BaseTampa, Florida1:48 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thats so nice. A lot of spirit. Great spirit for this country. Thank you, all. We have tremendous spirit and I want to thank you.We had a wonderful election, didnt we? (Applause.) And I saw those numbers -- and you like me, and I like you. Thats the way it worked. (Laughter.)  I'm honored to be here today among so many of our really and truly great heroes. I want to begin by thanking General Votel and General Thomas for their distinguished leadership and service on behalf of our country. Very, very outstanding people. Id also like to thank General Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Thats big stuff, when you have the Chairman. Where is -- Joe, stand up for a second. This is one of the great people. (Applause.) Thank you. Also, Commander Vogel and everyone serving at MacDill Air Force Base. Quite a place. And were going to be loading it up with beautiful new planes and beautiful new equipment. Youve been lacking a little equipment. Were going to load it up. Youre going to get a lot of equipment. Believe me. (Applause.)So importantly, also, let me thank all of the coalition partners and their representatives assembled here today. We proudly -- very proudly -- stand with you, and we will be fighting for your security. Theyre fighting for our security and freedom. Let me recognize our great governor and a very good friend of mine, and somebody who endorsed me -- that makes him a better friend of mine. (Laughter.) You know, if they dont endorse, believe me, if youre ever in this position, its never quite the same, okay? (Laughter.) You can talk, but it never means the same. But this man is a great, great governor and has done a fantastic job -- Rick Scott, governor, stand up please. (Applause.) Thank you, Rick.Finally, on behalf of the entire nation, let me express our gratitude to all members -- and I mean all members -- of our military serving in the United States Central Command and the United States Special Operations Command. We salute the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard, along with our civilian defense personnel, who are so important to the success of what were doing.Let me also recognize the military families and spouses who bravely shoulder the burdens of war. I want every military family in this country to know that our administration is at your service. We stand with you 100 percent. We will protect those who protect us, and we will never ever let you down. As your President, I have no higher duty than to protect the American people -- highest duty we have. I said it the other night. Great, great Supreme Court nominee -- you all saw that -- but I said to myself, perhaps the only thing more important to me definitely is the defense of our nation. The Supreme Court is so important, but we have to defend our nation. And we will do that, believe me. (Applause.) We will do that. And each and every one of you is central to that mission.The men and women serving at CENTCOM and SOCOM have poured out their hearts and souls for this country. They really experience things that very few people get to experience. Youve shed your blood across the continents and the oceans. Youve engaged the enemy on distant battlefields, toiled in the burning heat and bitter cold, and sacrificed everything so that we can remain safe and strong and free. Our administration will always honor our sacred bond to those who serve, and we will never ever forget you. Believe me, we will never ever forget you.We will ensure that the men and women of our military have the tools, equipment, resources, training, and supplies you need to get the job done. Youve seen me say weve been depleted. Our navy is at a point almost as low as World War I. Thats a long time ago. Thats a long time ago. Its not going to happen anymore, folks. Its not going to happen anymore -- not with me. But we will ensure no taxpayer dollars are wasted. I have already saved more than $700 million when I got involved in the negotiation on the F-35. You know about that. And I want to thank Lockheed Martin and I want to thank Boeing, and I want to thank all of the companies that have really opened up. And when I say opened up, Rick Scott understands this very well -- opened up and cut their prices. Okay? Because thats what they did. And weve got that program, its going to be back in really great shape from really being very troubled. And we are going to be taking care of our great veterans. We will make a historic financial investment in the Armed Forces of the United States and show the entire world that America stands with those who stand in defense of freedom. We have your back every hour, every day, now and always. That also means getting our allies to pay their fair share. It's been very unfair to us. We strongly support NATO. We only ask that all of the NATO members make their full and proper financial contributions to the NATO Alliance, which many of them have not been doing. Many of them have not been even close, and they have to do that.Central Command and Central [Special] Operations Command are at the very center of our fight against radical Islamic terrorism. America stands in awe of your courage. Those serving at CENTCOM have bravely fought across the theater of war in the Middle East, and bravely battled a vicious enemy that has no respect for human life. Today, we express our gratitude to everyone serving overseas, including all of our military personnel in Afghanistan. SOCOM has dispatched its legendary warriors to the most secret, sensitive and daring missions in defense of the United States of America. No enemy stands a chance against our Special Forces -- not even a chance. They don't have a chance, and that's the way we're going to keep it. And you're going to be better off because you're going to have the finest equipment known to man. Going to be better off.For proof that our nation has been blessed by God, look no further than the men and women of the United States military. They are the greatest fighters and the greatest force of justice on the face of the Earth and that the world has ever known. The challenges facing our nation nevertheless are very large -- very, very large. We're up against an enemy that celebrates death and totally worships destruction -- you've seen that. ISIS is on a campaign of genocide, committing atrocities across the world. Radical Islamic terrorists are determined to strike our homeland as they did on 9/11; as they did from Boston to Orlando, to San Bernardino. And all across Europe, you've seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's happening. It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported and, in many cases, the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons and you understand that. So today, we deliver a message in one very unified voice: To these forces of death and destruction, America and its allies will defeat you. We will defeat them. We will defeat radical Islamic terrorism, and we will not allow it to take root in our country. We're not going to allow it. You've been seeing what's been going on over the last few days. We need strong programs so that people that love us and want to love our country and will end up loving our country are allowed in -- not people that want to destroy us and destroy our country. (Applause.)Freedom, security and justice will prevail. In his first State of the Union message, President George Washington wrote that, ""To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace."" Almost 200 years later, as the General was also speaking about Ronald Reagan, he said that wisdom comes in three very, very strong words: ""Peace through strength."" I've said it many times during the campaign, speaking in front of tens of thousands of people at one sitting, and I'd always mention America first -- a phrase that you probably never heard, ""Make America Great Again."" (Applause.) Anybody ever heard that? (Applause.) And peace through strength.The men and women of the United States military provide the strength to bring peace to our troubled, troubled times. We stand behind you. We support your mission. We love our country. We are loyal to our people. We respect our flag. We celebrate our traditions. We honor our heroes. You are our heroes. And we are prepared to fight. And we pray for peace.Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)END2:00 P.M.

86,2017-02-06,"Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer en route JBA, 2/6/2016","Aboard Air Force OneEn Route Joint Base Andrews4:01 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Hi guys, how are you? Hope you had a great day. I want to start off by congratulating the five-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. It was a great day for football last night. And the President looks forward to welcoming the New England Patriots to the White House later this year.As you know, during the weekend, the President spoke to four world leaders. On Saturday, he spoke with Italian Prime Minister Gentiloni, during which they discussed strengthening cooperation around a large range of shared interests. The President also agreed to attend the G7 meeting in May, where he looks forward to meeting with the Prime Minister on the sidelines. Also on Saturday, the President spoke with Ukrainian President Poroshenko, addressing a variety of topics, including Ukraines long-running conflict with Russia. They also discussed plans for an in-person meeting in the future.On Sunday, the President had a call with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg, where he reiterated the United States interest in (inaudible) NATO. The two leaders agreed to continue close coordination and cooperation to discuss the full range of security issues facing NATO and its member countries. Following that call, the President spoke with New Zealand Prime Minister English, affirming the close relationship between the two countries and our appreciation for New Zealands significant contributions to international peace.You guys, as you saw this afternoon, the President had an opportunity to visit with leaders of both SOCOM and CENTCOM to get an update on the issues facing our military and the hotspots around the world, the challenges we face, and the actions that our brave men and women around the globe are taking to help keep this country safe. The President obviously had a chance to sit down with enlisted members of our military after that, and hear from them their concerns and issues, and, most importantly, thank them for their service to our nation.Tomorrow, we have a delegation that is heading out to attend the inauguration of the Haitian President in Port-au-Prince. The State Department's Undersecretary for Political Affairs, Tom Shannon, will lead the delegation, which includes representatives from both the State Department and the White House. The President is also looking forward to welcoming the Prime Minister of Japan this Friday, and well have further guidance on that visit this weekend.With that, Ill take a few questions. Steve.Q  Can you give us an example of a terrorist attack anywhere that the news media has not reported on?MR. SPICER: Well provide a list later. Theres several instances. And the President, again, got a great update today on the fight against ISIS thats going on throughout the region and what our military is facing throughout this globe, trying to combat ISIS. But theres a lot of instances that have occurred where I dont think that theyve gotten the coverage it's deserved, and I think thats what the President was clearly referring to there.Steve.Q  Are you rethinking your strategy toward this executive order? Whats your next step in pushing this ahead?MR. SPICER: Were not rethinking the strategy at all. I think the court has asked both parties to present their cases. Remember, what were discussing right now has nothing to do with the merits of the order. The law is very clear on this, that the President has huge discretion to protect the safety of the American people and our nations institutions with respect to who can come into this country. This is just purely on the injunction that the judge issued, and I think that were going to make that case tonight -- or hes got -- both sides have put forward their rulings.But again, when you look at the case in Massachusetts -- or the judge in Massachusetts, clearly the law is on the Presidents side. The Constitution is on the Presidents side. He has broad discretion to do whats in the nations best interests to protect our people. And we feel very confident that we will prevail in this matter.Q  But you're not thinking about withdrawing the executive order or rewriting it?MR. SPICER: No, no, no. This law -- this executive order was done in the best interest of protecting the American people. And I think this is something that has broad support from the American people from one coast to another, and we're going to continue to do what we have to. And this President is committed to making sure that the country and its people are safe.Q  Sean, the President over the weekend said that he believed that jihadis were now pouring into the country. Is there any evidence to suggest that that's true? Is that what intelligence is telling him?MR. SPICER: I think part of the reason he issued the order the way he did was to ensure that people didn't have an advance notice, and he protected the country and ensured that we have an idea of who's coming in and out of the country.Q  Is anybody coming in?MR. SPICER: Im not going to get into specific information that the President has. Needless to say, again, that his number-one priority is to do what he can to keep the American people safe.Q  John Yoo, who was obviously a major figure in the Bush administration, who spoke about -- was a big proponent of executive authority, today wrote in The New York Times about his concerns about the way that the new administration is taking action. What do you say to him?MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think if you look at Secretary Kellys comments from last week, this was an action that was fully coordinated through departments to make sure that everyone understood what we're going to do, to make sure it was compliant, and that it was in the best interest of keeping America safe.Mr. Yoo has obviously spent some time in the Justice Department, and I think he should understand better than anybody that we did -- we took all the necessary steps and did it in a way that protected country.Q  You said -- just to be clear -- before you said that, you're going to follow up later with the unreported terrorist -- were they unreported or under-reported? MR. SPICER: Under-reported.Q  And what are the reasons? The President said that we all know what the reasons are.MR. SPICER: Look, I think the Presidents comments were very clear at the time. He felt as though members of the media don't always cover some of those events to the extent that other events might get covered; that a protest will get blown out of the water, and yet an attack or a foiled attack doesn't necessarily get the same coverage.Hes doing what he can to protect this nation and protect our people. And that's why I think sometimes the polls don't reflect what you see on the media. You see a wide degree of support for the Presidents policies to protect this country, to create jobs, to grow the economy, and yet a lot of those stories and successes that hes had in a mere two and a half weeks in office arent exactly covered to the degree to which they should be.Q  So he thinks that these terror attacks are under-reported to make him look bad?MR. SPICER: No, that's not what he said at all. I think his statement was very clear on that. Yes.Q  Do you have a plan to reinstate extreme vetting? MR. SPICER: What?Q  Extreme vetting of refugees, do you have -- is there a plan to reinstate it?MR. SPICER: Reinstate it?Q  Reinstate, yes. After the ban has been overturned.MR. SPICER: Once we win the case, it will go right back into action. We're complying with the court. Once we prevail, it will go right back into action. And again, part of that plan was a 90-day and 100-day plan respectively with respect to refugees and then people coming in to make sure that we took the steps and developed a further plan to protect the country. Whether we add people or go more stringently in other aspects is up to part of what is determined during that period.Q  Sean, can you elaborate a little bit on what the President said to Bill OReilly about the irregular voter registration list and what Vice President Pence is going to be doing on that?MR. SPICER: I think hes very clear that he is going to -- he has named Vice President Pence to lead a task force that will look into this. But obviously when you see so many people that have registered in two states, that that presents a problem. There are people that have registered in two have died and been still on the rolls. I think we need to look into this to make sure that we're protecting the integrity of the vote; that one person's vote should count the same as the next. And any attempt to undermine that really undermines anyone else's vote right now, and that's the problem -- is that we need to make sure that when somebody votes, that we have the highest degree of integrity of that counting.Q  Hey, Sean, when the President tweeted this morning -- ""I call my own shots"" -- was he referring to Steve Bannon's role in the White House or his TIME magazine cover? What was he referring to?MR. SPICER: It was nothing specific. But I think the President -- there's been a lot of attempts to discuss how this works. The President, from day one, back through the campaign and, frankly, his time as a successful businessman, always called the shots. He's the decider. He's the one who develops the policy. He's the one who makes the decisions. And I think that there are so many times when you see things that don't recognize that he is the guy that calls those shots. He develops the policies, he implements the policies, he makes the key decisions.Q  Just to follow up on that, The New York Times said this morning that you're rethinking your strategy of how swiftly to roll out initiatives. Are you going to slow things down?MR. SPICER: I would say that that story was so riddled with inaccuracies and lies that they owe the President an apology for the way that that thing was -- there were just literally blatant factual errors. And it's unacceptable to see that kind of reporting, or so-called reporting. That is literally the epitome of fake news. Q  What part of the story was the --MR. SPICER: I mean, you start at the top -- I don't think the President owns a bathrobe, or definitely doesn't wear one. There was no meetings in conference -- I mean, it's just -- from top to bottom, it made up stories that just don't exist. And I think that's unfortunate for people that look to news institutions like that for their news because it is just not an accurate portrayal of what's really happening. Q  Was the claim about whether he was briefed on the order -- the makeup of the NSC?MR. SPICER: What's that?Q  The story talked about how the President was disappointed that he hadn't been adequately briefed on Bannon taking --MR. SPICER: The President is briefed on all aspects of --Q  So could you just address that specifically? What was he told and who briefed him on it?MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into detail, but I would say that the President is clearly aware of the policies that come out of the White House with his name on it. That is what I was getting at earlier to Steve. The President -- when it comes to decisions and policy, it's the President who leads, the President who tells us how to implement it.Thank you guys very much. Enjoy the landing.END4:10 P.M.

Right to Try legislation would allow doctors to prescribe to terminally ill patients medicines that have only made it through the first of three approval phases at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).During the presidential campaign, the President and Vice President voiced their strong support for enacting Right to Try legislation at the federal level.The Right to Try families expressed to Vice President Pence that expanded access to drug therapies would allow patients to circumvent the bureaucratic process at the FDA, as well as long waits for clinical trials, to obtain life-saving treatments.Vice President Pence reiterated his belief that a Right to Try law is fundamentally about restoring hope and gives patients with terminal illnesses a fighting chance by giving them access to experimental drugs that have already passed the FDAs safety review process. The Vice President and the families discussed how Right to Try legislation is the first step towards getting patients the medical innovations that will save their lives. Vice President Pence offered the Presidents encouragement to the families to keep fighting for a national Right to Try law and made clear that both he and President Trump are committed supporters of Right to Try legislation.As Governor of Indiana, Vice President Pence signed Right to Try legislation into law in 2015.

Guthrie, R-KY, and 12 cosponsors)The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on States, local communities, and institutions of higher education.H.J. Res. 42 would nullify the Employment and Training Administration's Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Labor. The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested. The rule imposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.H.J.

97,2017-02-07,Remarks by President Trump in Roundtable with County Sheriffs,"Roosevelt Room9:49 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Oh, the sheriffs are great people. Well, thank you very much. Law enforcement was a big subject in the campaign and a subject that was very well received. You have no idea how respected you are, sheriffs and, generally speaking, the leaders of law enforcement. Anybody involved in law enforcement, you have no idea how respected you are -- you don't get the honest facts from the press -- if you don't know how respected you are. So I just want to say that upfront. Im honored to welcome the National Sheriffs' Association. Your leadership is here, and I know the great job you do. Ive known you and followed you for a long period of time. Your efforts and your officers are outstanding. I know so many sheriffs from my area -- some in particular -- and they're great friends and great people. I just want to let you know that our job is to help you in law enforcement, and we're going to help you do your job. We're going to expand access to abuse-deterring drugs, which a lot of you have been talking about. They're out, and they're very hard to get. Stop the opioid epidemic. We've got to do it. Its a new thing. And, honestly, people arent talking about it enough. Its a new thing, and its a new problem for you folks. Its probably a vast majority of your crimes -- or at least a very big portion of your crimes are caused by drugs.We're going to stop the border. We're going to stop -- we're not going to have the drugs pouring from the border like they have been. We will work with you on supporting your longstanding efforts to strengthen the bonds between the communities and the police, which is very important. And its sort a new phenomenon to a certain extent, and its happening more and more. And some great results out when you can strengthen the bonds.We're committed to securing our borders to reduce crime, illegal drugs, human trafficking, especially in border counties. We have a lot of the border counties represented. We're also committed to working with law enforcement to stop terrorist attacks. You've been reading about that, been seeing about that -- they want to take a lot of our powers away. There are some people with a lot of the wrong intentions, and it's -- we've got a lot of bad people out there.And, Dana, I just want to thank you on behalf of the government, on behalf of our country for leading a strong, strong effort in the courts. We really appreciate it, believe me. Because as you know, we don't have an attorney general. We have somebody who's phenomenal -- Jeff Sessions. Hes going to be there hopefully soon. But I believe its about a record for the length of time that theyve delayed the Cabinet. These are Cabinet members that are phenomenal people. And we havent had representation, and now we have excellent representation, fortunately, in Dana. And Jeff will be with you very shortly, hopefully. But we're having a hard time getting approvals. And its only a delay tactic -- its all politics. One person came up to me, a senator, a Democratic senator who came up to me the other day and said, Jeff Sessions is a fantastic man. Hes fabulous. Hes a friend of mine. Hes a great, great man and a great talent. And we're lucky to have him. I said, oh, great, I guess that means you're voting for him? No, I wont be voting that. (Laughter.) He said, politics doesn't allow me to do that. I thought it was a disgrace. If the press talks loud and hard enough, Ill have to tell you who said that to me. You don't want to hear it. You don't want to hear who said that? (Laughter.) I didn't think youd care. I didn't think youd care. Ill probably tell you, actually. Anyway. So we're going to be very tough on crime. So we're going to be very tough on the drugs pouring in, and that's a big part of the crime. We're going to be very strong at the border. We have no choice. And we're going to be building a wall.  We're starting very soon. General Kelly will be working with a lot of you. And hes fantastic. He was the one who got approved very quickly along with General Mattis. Hes very, very outstanding. And I very much appreciate that you're here today. And, Sheriff, I really thank you for leading the effort. Your reputation is fantastic, and its a great honor to know you. Maybe we can go around -- well let the press stay for a little while, unless youd rather leave. Would the press rather stay? Just so you understand. This is a new phenomenon. You're on live television all over the world right now, so don't get nervous when you speak, okay? (Laughter.) But I don't think these things have ever taken place before. But you are on live television, so if you don't want to say anything, you don't have to. But if you do, I think its a good thing to say. So maybe well just go around the room.SHERIFF WELSH: Well, Mr. President, thank you so much for having us here. Im Sheriff Carolyn Welsh from Chester County, Pennsylvania, and proud to say Pennsylvania, the commonwealth, that put you over the top November 8th.THE PRESIDENT: Its true. (Laughter.)SHERIFF WELSH: We're very proud of that. We don't stop bragging about that.THE PRESIDENT: You were a great support.SHERIFF WELSH: Thank you. And I just want to thank you for, during the campaign and since the campaign, being such a strong, courageous supporter of law enforcement on the national -- on the federal level with the Border Patrol, on the state level, and the counties, municipalities, boroughs, and particularly with the elected sheriffs of the counties -- because we are the sheriff, we are the peoples representative, and we are elected by the people, and we greatly appreciate your strong and continued support.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Carolyn. Theres a new sheriff in town. SHERIFF WELSH: That's right. THE PRESIDENT: I hear this so much. (Laughter.) I hear this so much, Dana. They always use, ""theres a new sheriff in town."" So anyway.SHERIFF EAVANSON: Sheriff Harold Eavanson from Rockwall County, Texas. We appreciate your support very much. Our county is probably about 85 percent Republican. So it was pretty easy for you --THE PRESIDENT: They were very nice. I agree. They were very nice.SHERIFF EAVANSON: And being in a border state, I have been to the border in Texas any number of times, been to the border in Arizona. I clearly understand the problem we have. And previously when wed go to the border and hear what the ranchers and sheriffs have to say -- those border sheriffs and border ranchers, it was a 180 degrees from what we heard from the previous administration. THE PRESIDENT: So you're seeing a big difference? SHERIFF EAVANSON: We're very proud to have you as President.THE PRESIDENT: And that's only two weeks. Okay? Its a very short period of time. Im hearing it from a lot of people. People are calling in and they're -- and people I know that are in the area, they're saying its like day and night. Because we're not playing games. We're not playing games. We're stopping the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth. So thank you very much. I appreciate it.SHERIFF EAVANSON: You're welcome.MR. THOMPSON: Mr. President, Im Jonathan Thompson, the executive director and CEO of the National Sheriffs Association. Let me tell you the difference of six months. I sat in this room, in this chair, and I was pleading -- I was begging for help. Today, youve invited us here to your home. You're offering help. You're delivering on that offer. And on behalf of our members across the country, thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Its so nice. I appreciate that. SHERIFF STANEK: Mr. President, Rich Stanek from Hennepin County, Minneapolis, Minnesota.First off, thank you very much. As Ms. Conway said, next time, up by three points in my state -- over the top.THE PRESIDENT: Boy, we almost won your state. You know we weren't supposed to do very well in your state, and we won -- lost by one point. I say, if I went there one more visit we would have won. (Laughter.) We would have won Minnesota. But it was very close. SHERIFF STANEK: Many of us have your back, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, I know.SHERIFF STANEK: And I just want to say that you hit on two topics that are near and dear to my heart. The first is opioids -- 144 people that died last year as a result of opioid overdose; 31 percent increase over the year before. We need help. Eighty-plus percent of the drugs come from south of the border. Everybody knows it. I know you will do something about it.THE PRESIDENT: I will. It's already being done, believe me. It's a big, big difference. And we will do that, and you do have a big problem, and you have a big problem with the refugees pouring in, don't you?SHERIFF STANEK: Yes, we do, sir. And we all asking if what you're doing, which is let the courts decide, do what we've been doing. Rule of law is strong and the proper vetting of individuals is really important to us.THE PRESIDENT: Well, you know, the vetting is much, much tougher now. And we need this court case. It will be very helpful to keeping the wrong people out of our country. You understand that better than anybody. So I think we're going to have some good results.SHERIFF STANEK: I do, sir.THE PRESIDENT: It may take a little while. And you know, this is a very dangerous period of time because while everybody is talking and dealing, a lot of bad people are thinking about, hey, let's go in right now. But we're being very, very tough with the vetting -- tougher than ever before.SHERIFF STANEK: Sir, I chaired the Homeland Security Committee for the National Sheriffs' Association. We heard from General Kelly yesterday, his message was right on the mark about carrying out your directives, and we appreciate that.THE PRESIDENT: That used to be a political position, you know, what General Kelly is doing here right now. Homeland Security, if you remember -- it's like a political position. Not anymore. Now it's, in my opinion, one of truly most important positions. So he's doing a great job. Thank you very much.SHERIFF STANEK: Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Yes, sir.SHERIFF GLICK: Mr. President, thank you. It's such an honor to be here. I'm Danny Glick, sheriff of Laramie County, Wyoming. You know, there are so many issues that you'll hear going around this table. One of the ones that probably isn't -- that people don't realize is EPA decisions that have affected our coal industry, our oil industry in the West. But beyond that, it increases the number of people that are jobless and thus increases our crime statistics. And it's starting to overwhelm us. We're very small out there for the most part, and we don't have the numbers of deputies, officers and law enforcement that can sometimes keep up with this. I appreciate what you've done and what you're planning in the future. I think it was very well publicized, and I just appreciate being here today.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Sheriff. And I will tell you that the EPA -- you're right. I call it -- it's clogged the bloodstream of our country. People can't do anything. People are looking to get approvals for factories for 15 years, and then after the 15th year they get voted down after having spent a fortune. So that's going to end. We have one of our really great people -- as you know, Scott is looking to be approved by the Senate. We're still waiting for that one, too. It's a disgrace what's going on. But as soon as he gets involved, we're going to unclog the system.And, by the way, people are going to get rejected, but they're going to get rejected quickly. But for the most part, they're going to be accepted when they want to do. We're going to bring the jobs back. And your state was very, very good to me, as you know. I mean, they were very, very good to me and I appreciate that. And just tell the people we're going to get the system unclogged and we're going to get it up. As you know, I approved two pipelines that were stuck in limbo forever. I don't even think it was controversial. You know, I approved them -- I haven't even heard -- I haven't had one call from anybody saying, oh, that was a terrible thing you did. I haven't had one call. You know, usually, if I do something it's like bedlam, right? I haven't had one call from anybody. And a lot of jobs -- in the Keystone case, we have potentially 32,000 jobs almost immediately. And then, as you know, I did the Dakota pipeline and nobody called up to complain. Because it was unfair. Years of getting approvals, nobody showed up to fight it. This company spends a tremendous -- hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, and then all of a sudden, people show up to fight it. It's not fair to our companies. And I think everyone is going to be happy in the end, okay?So I appreciate it very much, Sheriff. It's a great honor to have you here. Thank you. And say hello to your people.Yes, sir.SHERIFF LAYTON: Good morning, Mr. President. I'm John Layton. I'm the sheriff of Marion County, Indiana, which is -- (laughter) --THE PRESIDENT: You never met our great Vice President. (Laughter.)SHERIFF LAYTON: I'm very proud of this man. And we as sheriffs -- this is, to me, it seems like it's unprecedented. I look back into the history of the NSA, long before myself, and I never have -- I could never find where -- not only did the President and now the Vice President, as well, has invited us into your house to share some concerns of ours --THE PRESIDENT: And in about 10 minutes, you're going to see the Oval Office, too, which is -- that's the other thing, you know, people have had meetings here. I had the car companies, the biggest companies -- Ford, General Motors, Fiat -- and they were in this room often. And I said, oh, so you've seen the Oval Office? ""No, we've never been invited to see the Oval Office."" You know where the Oval Office is? Ten feet in that direction -- 10 feet.SHERIFF LAYTON: Looking forward to it. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: Look, these are the biggest people that were going there -- these are the biggest people. So they were never invited to the Oval Office and they were only 10 feet away. You would think they would be invited. But you're going to see the Oval Office, okay?SHERIFF LAYTON: Thank you, Mr. President. One of the main concerns was not just my office as sheriff, but across the nation -- the mentally ill in the jails, and the people that they're being really, for lack of a better term, warehoused in our jails across America because we don't have the facilities necessary to take care of them on the outside. And it ends up a lot of these people go to jail because the public or the police officer happens to be mad at them at the time, instead of they need to be in the jail for a very good reason. So we just appreciate you having the back of law enforcement. We do all feel that, as everyone with a badge knows, that you do have our backs and that we're looking forward to years of harmony and taking care of business with the people we serve.THE PRESIDENT: Well, I appreciate it. And I will say that, in the recent election, law enforcement is with me. I mean, the numbers were staggering -- staggering. It wasn't like, gee, it's 51-49. Believe me, it was through the roof. Law enforcement and military also.SHERIFF LAYTON: Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT: I think, generally, people in uniform tend to like me. (Laughter.) Explain that to me. Dana, explain that to me. (Laughter.) So, Sheriff, thank you very much. And do you miss your former governor?SHERIFF LAYTON: We do, we do.THE PRESIDENT: You have a good new governor.SHERIFF LAYTON: Holcomb is holding down the fort for us, though, but big shoes for him to fill.THE PRESIDENT: Mike Pence has been fantastic.SHERIFF LAYTON: Yes, he has.THE PRESIDENT: Dana, I want to thank you for your service. Amazing the way you just stepped into the breach and have done such a good job. And let's see what happens with the court case.MR. BOENTE: Well, Mr. President, thank you for the privilege to serve you and the Department of Justice and the American people. I'm very honored by it. And I want to thank all the sheriffs here, but I guess our local and state partners -- it's very important to federal law enforcement and all the agencies. And I know that Senator Sessions -- we're looking forward to him getting to the Department -- will make that an important priority. And he wants to strengthen that bond that we have with them because it's very, very important to law enforcement.THE PRESIDENT: Yes, well, thank you very much. And, you know, one of the things that you know better than anybody is that we had a very good victory in Boston. So I said to everybody, why dont we use the Boston case? Why arent we using the Boston case? Because the Boston victory was great, but it's statutorily --MR. BOENTE: Judge Gordon, who wrote that decision, had a very good analysis where he referred to immigration law, and I thought it was a terrific opinion. And I think its the right opinion. THE PRESIDENT: And a highly respected judge, too. So I appreciate it. Thank you, Dana, very much. Appreciate it. SHERIFF PAGE: Mr. President, Im Sheriff Page from Rockingham County, North Carolina. And you did very well in North Carolina. (Laughter.) And I just want to --THE PRESIDENT: Go North Carolina.SHERIFF PAGE: Hey! (Laughter.) And I just want to say that we appreciate you being where youre at. The first responsibility of government is protecting its people. As we as elected by the people and youre elected by the people, we got that. When you say there's a new sheriff in town, we relate to that. Youre about the rule of law. We havent seen that in many years, and we appreciate that.And I want to tell you something -- when General Kelly was speaking yesterday for the sheriffs, he made -- he was telling us about -- he went -- I saw something that I havent seen before. He went to the border, he looked at the assets, and he asked the law enforcement down there, whats going on and what can we do to help fix the situation down here. So youve got a good team. Youre putting together a good team. Youve got the support of sheriffs from across the country, and we appreciate what youre doing.THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. And a funny story -- so when General Kelly was just sworn in, now Secretary Kelly, and I said, you want to have dinner tonight and well talk? Sir, Im heading to the border. I said, I like that better. (Laughter.) We dont need to eat. I said, I like that better. So hes right on the ball, hes going to be fantastic. Because everybody has said the same thing. Thank you. Thats very nice.SHERIFF PAGE: Thank you, sir.SHERIFF MAHONEY: Good morning, Mr. President. Dave Mahoney, Im the sheriff in Dane County, which is Madison, Wisconsin. I want to thank you for inviting our nations sheriffs into the White House. You know, as the only elected law enforcement leaders in our community, we are the most engaged in our community's issues and concerns. And I think its important. I think theres a strong message when the President of the United States invites our nations sheriffs in to talk about those issues that are of importance in our community.THE PRESIDENT: Has this ever happened before with the sheriffs?PARTICIPANT: No, sir.PARTICIPANT: No, sir.  THE PRESIDENT: It never happened?PARTICIPANT: Never. THE PRESIDENT: And yet the murder rate in our country is the highest its been in 47 years, right? Did you know that? Forty-seven years. I used to use that -- Id say that in a speech and everybody was surprised, because the press doesnt tell it like it is. It wasnt to their advantage to say that. But the murder rate is the highest its been in, I guess, from 45 to 47 years. And you would think that you would be invited here, and you would think that you people would be able to solve -- had you -- if you ran Chicago, you would solve that nightmare, I tell you. Ill bet everybody in that room, especially Carolyn, right, would raise their hand. Because to allow -- I mean, literally -- hundreds of shootings a month, its worse than some of the places that we read about in the Middle East, where you have wars going on. Its so sad. Chicago has become so sad a situation.SHERIFF MAHONEY: Im only three hours from downtown Chicago, and as Sheriff Stanek mentioned, the issues of heroin and opiate addiction -- Im averaging 12, 15 overdoses a week in my community. And we need help from DEA, FBI, and our task forces. We need them to be adequately funded and led by leaders who want to work collectively with our nations sheriffs.THE PRESIDENT: How much of your crime is caused, do you think, by drugs generally?SHERIFF MAHONEY: Eighty percent? THE PRESIDENT: Eighty percent. So without drugs, you would have a whole different ballgame. SHERIFF MAHONEY: I have a jail, over 1,000 beds. Eighty percent suffer from chronic drug and alcohol addiction.THE PRESIDENT: And when did it start, big league? Or has it been going on for many years?SHERIFF MAHONEY: Well, I think heroin and opiates have overshadowed cocaine, which of course has been, since the eighties, our number-one drug of choice. Now its prescription painkillers and --THE PRESIDENT: And at a much higher level?SHERIFF MAHONEY: At a higher level. THE PRESIDENT: Much higher.SHERIFF MAHONEY: The overdoses are at a much higher level.THE PRESIDENT: Right, right.PARTICIPANT: Mr. President, I hate to interrupt -- it used to take 90 days to take a load of heroin from the border to get it into the (inaudible) mainstream. Now its taking 14 days. THE PRESIDENT: Okay, well, well have it take infinity, okay? (Laughter.) SHERIFF MAHONEY: I want to thank you too for seeking the input and guidance of our nations sheriffs on issues like immigration. My community is looking for immigration reform, an expedited way for a good immigrant to obtain citizenship in this great country. And I appreciate the invitation today to join you, and look forward to working with you on many of these issues. Some well disagree on, but far more were going to agree on.THE PRESIDENT: Absolutely, youre right. I actually cant believe that were having to fight to protect the security -- in a court system to protect the security of our nation. I cant even believe it. And a lot of people agree with us, believe me. Theres a group of people out there -- and I mean much more than half of our country -- much, much more. Youre not allowed to use the term silent majority anymore. Youre not allowed, because they make that into a whole big deal. But theres a group of people out there -- massive, massive numbers, far bigger than what you see protesting. And if those people ever protested, you would see a real protest. But they want to see our borders secure and our country secure, and they want to see people that can love our country come in, not people that are looking to destroy our country.So anyway, thank you, Sheriff.SHERIFF AUBREY: Sheriff John Aubrey, fifth-term sheriff, Jefferson County, Kentucky. Past president of National Sheriffs' Association. And my fellow sheriffs have brought up a number of points, and Id like to add two to it that I know are on your plate and the administrations plate. The 1033 program, where we were sharing Department of Defense surplus material that helps us in our war. They were used in the war, and they helped us in our war. That got severely curtailed. And the other thing is asset forfeiture. People want to say were taking money and without due process. Thats not true. We take money from dope dealers --THE PRESIDENT: So youre saying -- okay, so youre saying the asset-taking you used to do, and it had an impact, right? And youre not allowed to do it now?SHERIFF AUBREY: No, they have curtailed it a little bit. And Im sure the folks are --THE PRESIDENT: And thats for legal reasons? Or just political reasons? SHERIFF AUBREY: They make it political and they make it -- they make up stories. All youve got to do --THE PRESIDENT: Id like to look into that, okay? Theres no reason for that. Dana, do you think theres any reason for that? Are you aware of this?MR. BOENTE: I am aware of that, Mr. President. And we have gotten a great deal of criticism for the asset forfeiture, which, as the sheriff said, frequently was taking narcotics proceeds and other proceeds of crime. But there has been a lot of pressure on the department to curtail some of that.THE PRESIDENT: So what do you do? So in other words, they have a huge stash of drugs. So in the old days, you take it. Now were criticized if we take it. So who gets it? What happens to it? Tell them to keep it?MR. BOENTE: Well, we have what is called equitable sharing, where we usually share it with the local police departments for whatever portion that they worked on the case. And it was a very successful program, very popular with the law enforcement community. THE PRESIDENT: And now what happens?MR. BOENTE: Well, now weve just been given -- theres been a lot of pressure not to forfeit, in some cases.THE PRESIDENT: Who would want that pressure, other than, like, bad people, right? But who would want that pressure? You would think theyd want this stuff taken away.SHERIFF AUBREY: You have to be careful how you speak, I guess. But a lot of pressure is coming out of -- was coming out of Congress. I dont know that that will continue now or not.THE PRESIDENT: I think less so. I think Congress is going to get beat up really badly by the voters because they've let this happen. And I think badly. I think you'll be back in shape. So, asset forfeiture, we're going to go back on, okay?SHERIFF AUBREY: Thank you, sir. THE PRESIDENT: I mean, how simple can anything be? You all agree with that, I assume, right?PARTICIPANT: Absolutely, yeah. THE PRESIDENT: Do you even understand the other side of it?PARTICIPANT: No. THE PRESIDENT: It's like some things --PARTICIPANT: No sense.THE PRESIDENT: Sort of like the Iran deal. Nobody even understands how a thing like that could have happened. It does nothing.PARTICIPANT: You shouldnt be allowed to profit from the illegal proceeds. So if you're going to sell narcotics and sell illegal drugs in our country, you also cannot profit from that. And so we seize those profits.THE PRESIDENT: So do we need any legislation or any executive orders for that, would you say, Dana -- to put that back in business?MR. BOENTE: I dont think we need any executive orders. We just need kind of some encouragement to move in that direction.THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Good. You're in charge. (Laughter.) I love that answer, because it's better than signing executive orders and then these people take it and they make it look so terrible -- ""oh, it's so terrible."" I love it. You're encouraged. PARTICIPANT: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Good. Asset forfeiture. You're encouraged. Okay. Yes, sir.MR. BITTICK: Mr. President, we appreciate you having us here today at the White House. My name is John Cary Bittick, and I'm a sheriff in Monroe County, Georgia. And I'm a past president of the National Sheriffs Association, as well. And I currently chair our governmental affairs committee. And I just want to thank you for the administration working actually on pieces of legislation and on political ideas with us. It's refreshing, and we are thoroughly enjoying it. We are currently working with Senator Grassley on some criminal justice reform issues. And the administration has been supporting us. And asset forfeiture is a big thing.THE PRESIDENT: Okay, go for it. Just go for it. Dana will tell me if I can't or if -- (laughter) -- MR. BITTICK: Yes, sir. I think they got that message.THE PRESIDENT: Okay, that's great.MR. BITTICK: But we appreciate it, and we appreciate your ear. And we appreciate you taking the time to sit down and at least talk to us.THE PRESIDENT: I appreciate it too. Thank you, John.MR. BITTICK: Thanks for your support.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. SHERIFF CHAMPAGNE: Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President. Greg Champagne, I am sheriff in St. Charles Parish, Louisiana, basically a suburban community outside of New Orleans. I have the honor of representing 3,088 sheriffs around the country. And you see the leadership of our organization. These are the leadership of past presidents and the future presidents of our agency. But more importantly than that, we all represent and oversee literally a few hundred thousand deputy sheriffs who are truly the backbone of law enforcement in this country. We have a bumper sticker the NSA puts out that says, ""Sheriffs and deputies: The original homeland security."" And so that is a force-multiplier.Those men and women out there are the tip of the spear, and we stand ready to help and keep this community safe, because that's what we're all elected to do. So we thank you so much for having us.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. You're a great group of people.We're going to go into the Oval Office. Does anybody have anything to -- not even a question, a statement, as to how we can bring about law enforcement in a very good, civil, lovely way, but we have to stop crime -- right? Would anybody like to make a statement?PARTICIPANT: Mr. President, on asset forfeiture, we got a state senator in Texas who was talking about introducing legislation to require conviction before we can receive their forfeiture.THE PRESIDENT: Can you believe that?PARTICIPANT: And I told him that the cartel would build a monument to him in Mexico if he could get that legislation.THE PRESIDENT: Who is the state senator? Want to give his name? We'll destroy his career. (Laughter.) Okay, thank you.PARTICIPANT: Mr. President, we have been invited to the White House before. We've sat at this table with the former administration. This is totally different. Not once did the President go around the room and ask the sheriffs what were issues that were important to us, he or she, in our parts of the country, but rather it was an outgoing message about gun control, about other things. You asked us what is important to us, whether it's mental health in the jails, opioid addiction. You hit it right off the bat. The border, immigration, vetting. We appreciate that. That has not happened before. We've been here before, but we've never had a President sit down and listen to what it is that we're facing representing our constituents and public safety across this country. And that's why we appreciate it. That's why we're here today.THE PRESIDENT: You know, Bill Belichick, is a great guy, a friend of mine. And he was telling me -- somebody told me that he'll oftentimes, wanting to get a player, he'll go to the other players on the team -- he'll say, what do you think of this guy? You know, they all the different people. And he'll listen to them. And he's done very well, right? He's done very well. And essentially what they're -- we're talking to the people that know -- I'm not telling you, you're telling me. That came up this morning. I mean, that was a big statement. And I didnt realize it was all clogged. The system is all clogged. So we're going to unclog the system, and we're going to go right now into the Oval Office.Would you like the press to come in with you, Mr. Vice President? Should we let them come in? Otherwise they're going turn around, waiting for the next meeting for six hours. They dont have such an easy job, I'll tell you. They dont have such an easy job. Q  Mr. President, how far are you willing to take your travel ban fight?THE PRESIDENT: Oh, we're going to take it through the system. It's very important. It's very important for the country, regardless of me or whoever succeeds at a later date. I mean, we have to have security in our country. We have to have the ability. When you take some place like Syria, when you take all of the different people pouring -- and if you remember, ISIS said, we are going to infiltrate the United States and other countries through the migration. And then we're not allowed to be tough on the people coming in? Explain that one. So we'll see what happens. We have big court case. We're well-represented. And we're going to see what happens.Q  Is it going to go to the Supreme Court, you think?THE PRESIDENT: It could. We will see. Hopefully it doesnt have to. It's common sense. You know, some things are law, and I'm all in favor of that. And some things are common sense. This is common sense.Q  Mr. President, if it's unreported or under-reported -- ""unreported"" is the phrase you used yesterday -- but if it's under-reported, why do you think the media is not reporting, or America is not caring about this type of --THE PRESIDENT: I have to know, because I'm reported on possibly more than anybody in the world -- I dont think you have anything to say about that. I happen to know how dishonest the media is. I happen to know stories about me that should be good -- or bad -- you know, I dont mind a bad story if it's true. But I dont like bad stories that -- stories that should be a positive story when they make them totally negative. I understand the total dishonesty of the media better than anybody. And I let people know it. I mean, the media is a very, very dishonest arm, and we'll see what happens. Not everybody. And I have to say that. I always preface it by saying, not everybody. But there's tremendous dishonest -- pure, outright dishonesty from the media. Lets go into the Oval Office.(Meeting moves to Oval Office.)THE PRESIDENT: So they said this is the first President they've ever seen with all the papers on their desk. (Inaudible) cutting the price of the F-35 fighters. We have a lot of papers.Okay, go ahead, folks.PARTICIPANT: Mr. President, on behalf of 3,088 sheriffs in America, there is a new sheriff in town, and it's only fitting that we provide you with our sculpture. The first time the NSA has provided a sculpture to a non-law enforcement person. And there is a new sheriff in town -- for you. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much. Thank you. (Applause.) Its beautiful.END10:21 A.M. EST",20090.29,37.87000000000262,5674.22,10.670000000000073,2293.08,0.5199999999999818
98,2017-02-07,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/7/2017, #9","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:42 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Just before I came up, I wanted to let you all know that we're monitoring the severe weather that's going through Louisiana at this time. The President is aware of the situation and is going to be reaching out to local and state officials throughout the day.Also, yesterday evening, the President concurred with the FEMA Administrator's recommendation to approve Governor Bryant's request to add public assistance to the previously issued major disaster declaration in Mississippi. Per the Governor's request, public assistance will be added for three counties -- Forrest, Lamar, and Perry.Yesterday, the President had an amazing day at MacDill Air Force Base, where he met with leaders of both Special Operations Command and Central Command, and then had lunch with enlisted servicemembers thanking them for their service and hearing the ideas that were on their mind.The President announced his intent to make historic financial investment in the armed forces of the United States, showing the entire world that America has the back of all those who stand in defense of freedom. As he has said many times before, the armed forces are at the very center of our fight against radical Islamic terrorism, and we must protect those who protect us.The President kicked off today with a listening session of county sheriffs from around the country. The President welcomed leaders from the National Sheriffs' Association to the White House and pledged to work closely with all members of the law enforcement community to keep the American people safe. He assured the sheriffs that the Trump administration will make every effort to stop drugs and crime from flowing into the country, put an end to the opioid epidemic, secure the borders to keep terrorists out, and strengthen the bonds between state, local and federal law enforcement agencies.The sheriffs thanked the President for what they described as his ""unprecedented"" level of support for law enforcement and offered their full backing of his border security and immigration policies. They expressed how encouraged they have been by the pro-law enforcement atmosphere that has swept the country in the wake of the President's victory.They also presented a letter on behalf of the National Sheriffs' Association, thanking the President for his recent show of support for law enforcement, specifically on immigration and border security issues and commending the Presidents two executive orders for taking significant steps to enhancing public safety.The group engaged in a wide-ranging discussion about the issues facing the law enforcement community, which the sheriffs said was an opportunity they hadn't been given under the previous administration. The sheriffs closed the meeting by thanking the President for defending the rule of law. And the President took them to the Oval Office to honor them and show his appreciation for their outstanding work they do to keep our communities safe.A list of the attendees is available for those who are interested. After that meeting, the President held another listening session on how to best fix the VA. It's a top priority for the President and this administration to ensure that veterans get the care they need when and where they need it. Tragically, many of our veterans are being failed by a system that does not work. This administration will reform and modernize the VA under the leadership of Dr. Shulkin, creating a culture of accountability that puts our veterans first.The President welcomed the group to the Roosevelt Room and expressed his intention to take whatever steps are necessary to improve health care access and quality for our heroic veterans. Ms. Tiffany Smiley, the wife of a veteran who was blinded by an IED, detailed her family's difficulty and experience with the VA health care system, and offered suggestions to how it could be improved. The President, VA Secretary-designate Dr. David Shulkin, and a group of health care experts and veterans advocates, including Ike & Laura Perlmutter, engaged in a wide-ranging discussion on reforming the VA so that the needs of veterans come first.The experts discussed private sector solutions and innovations that could be used to improve the VA. The President praised the Secretary-designate for his commitment to veterans and thanked the group for their willingness to serve and do what was best for our veterans. They plan to meet on a regular basis to discuss their collective efforts to improve the VA and its health care system.Also this afternoon, the Vice President had a big day on Capitol Hill, where he cast a historic deciding vote for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos. The President believes strongly that our nations success depends on the education of our students. And Betsy DeVos has devoted nearly three decades of her time and talent to promoting educational opportunity. As Secretary, she will ensure that every student has access to a good school, whether its public, private, parochial, charter, or any other kind.The fact that we had to get to the point where the Vice President had to be pulled in to overcome the Democrats historic and partisan logjam of the Presidents qualified nominee is another glaring reminder of the unprecedented obstruction that Senate Democrats have engaged in throughout this process.The American people sent a strong message when they elected President Trump in November: They're fed up with business as usual in Washington. Democrats in the Senate should expect that voters will remember how they stood in the way of the President enacting an agenda that put him into office.Last week, I noted the President had a fair amount of Cabinet-level appointees awaiting a full vote by the Senate. Were looking forward to seeing more of the Presidents picks to lead agencies and departments confirmed in the upcoming week, despite these childish tactics of the Democrats in the Senate, who would rather keep the failed status quo than allowing to put the President's people in place.Also on the Hill today, Judge Gorsuch continues a full week of meetings with Republican and Democratic senators. Yesterday, he met with Senators Tester and Feinstein. Today he will meet with Senators Sasse, Schumer, Crapo, and Thune. The President is looking forward to a full hearing for the judge, followed by an up or down vote on this incredibly qualified nominee.At this moment, the President is meeting with Congressman Jason Chaffetz to discuss how to work together to enact his reform agenda. Later this afternoon, the President will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson. The President was obviously pleased to welcome and confirm -- swear in Secretary Tillerson in the Oval Office last week, and he's pleased that the Secretary is now able to bring his unique skillset and deep insights to the important work of the State Department.Following his discussion with Secretary Tillerson, the President will have calls with Prime Minister Rajoy of Spain and President Erdogan of Turkey. Well of course have readouts of both of those calls when they're completed.This evening, the President will host young officers from the United States Army Special Forces Qualification Course in the Oval Office. As the President said yesterday, members of our military and their families are our nations heroes. It is one of his top priorities to ensure that the men and women of our armed forces have the tools, equipment, and resources they need to execute their mission successfully. The President is looking forward to conveying his gratitude and support to these young brave captains.Later this evening, around 6:00, 9th Circuit Court will hold oral arguments, per its order from yesterday. I want to quickly run down what we can expect to happen tonight. A career attorney from the Department of Justice will present an argument in defense of the Presidents order. And to be clear, all thats at issue tonight is the hearing -- is an interim decision on whether the Presidents order is enforced or not until the case is heard on the actual merits of the order. Its a simple status quo versus anti-status quo decision.This is just like the case in Boston, which started as a temporary restraining order. There, once we were able to explain our position, the court lifted the order and held that the Presidents executive order could take effect. As I have stated before, 8 U.S. Code 1182 gives the President constitutional authority for this executive order. It says, Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions which he may deem to be appropriate."" We look forward to a final decision on the merits of this soon.Looking ahead, I know a few have been asking for more details on Prime Minister Abes visit later this week. As previously announced, he will visit the White House for meetings on the 10th of February. The President has also invited him down to Mar-a-Lago, and the two leaders will travel there for the weekend. This is a testament to the importance the United States places on the bilateral relationship and the strength of our alliance, and the deep economic ties between the United States and Japan.Needless to say, the President is looking very much forward to welcoming the New England Patriots to the White House to celebrate their fifth World Championship. It was obviously a spectacular game.Lastly, we have our eyes on Kabul today following the tragic suicide bombing that killed at least 19 Afghan civilians and wounded 14 [41]. Just this morning, General Flynn spoke with the Afghan National Security Advisor to reaffirm our continued support for Afghanistan and for our Strategic Partnership. We condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest possible terms, and we commend the Afghan security forces for their rapid response. We also reaffirm our support to the Afghan government as they work to defend their people against enemies of peace.And with that, I'll take your questions. David Jackson.Q  Sean, the list of 78 terrorist attacks that you released, it looked like it had been prepared well in advance. I mean, was that already on hand when President Trump made his comments? Or did you do it afterwards and plan to release it?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the answer was, we had been getting questions as to what the President's remarks were. We wanted to be very clear that there are a lot of examples between 2014 and 2016 that have occurred, and many of them havent gotten the attention that they have deserved. Its becoming too often that were seeing these attacks not get the spectacular attention that they deserve. And I think it undermines the understanding of the threat that we face around this country.The reason the President has been acting in so many of the ways that he has with executive order and otherwise, the discussions that he had down at CENTCOM and SOCOM yesterday, are because he cares about making sure that we dont have attacks in this country, that were protected, that were ahead of the curve. And I think what we need to do is to remind people that the Earth is a very dangerous place these days, that ISIS is trying to do us harm, and that the Presidents commitment is to keep this country safe.And I think part of this is to make sure that the American people are reminded how prevalent some of these attacks and how much time and attention they have or have not gotten, but, more importantly, to make sure that they understand the unwavering commitment that the President has and the actions that he will take to keep the country safe.Q  Was the list put together after his comments?MR. SPICER: Yes. Yes. Trey.Q  Thanks, Sean. On the call with Turkish President Erdogan later today, does President Trump intend to discuss plans for Syrian safe zones? And does the President expect Turkey to help create those zones?MR. SPICER: I think well have a readout for you on that. I dont want to get ahead of the two leaders calls.Alexis, RealClearPolitics.Q  Sean, I have two questions for you. You were mentioning that voters are going to remember how senators voted on the Presidents Cabinet nominees. Two Republicans voted against Betsy DeVos -- Senators Collins and Murkowski. Did the President reach out to either of them? And will he not forget what Republicans did in that particular nominee situation?MR. SPICER: I think -- look, the President has been very clear its not Republicans that have stood in the way of this nomination of all of these qualified individuals. Its been Democrats that have stalled over and over again, not attending hearings, trying to use every delay tactic possible. Its those people that have a problem, and I think thats the message that the party has missed on the Democratic side, which -- and I dont think that -- I wouldnt paint it with a broad brush, because I think its Senate Democrats, frankly, that havent gotten the message.Q  But he never reached out to them?MR. SPICER: Our team has been in contact with the entire Senate team to make sure that they understand and that theyve had visits as requested. But we have been in constant contact with the Senate, members of the Senate, their staffs. Our legislative affairs team has had an extremely robust schedule of meetings with their teams to make these nominees available to them.But I think the broader issue, again -- and with all due respect, I think its interesting that were focusing on the votes of two Republicans when you look at the spectrum of antics that have gone on in the Democrats. I mean, the tactics that they have done over and over and over again to delay, not show up to hearings, filibuster to the extent that they can, run the clock out -- its not Republicans that have a problem here, Alexis. Its the Democrats that continue to do this.Q  The second question has to do with the Presidents remarks about the Affordable Care Act in his interview on Sunday -- because he indicated in his response, in that interview, that he thought that the repeal-and-replace was going to take longer, perhaps into 2018. Can you clarify whether he is frustrated about this, what he is doing about the timing? Because, of course, voters who sent him here were anticipating that this might move faster than he was conveying in the interview.MR. SPICER: Well, I think luckily -- and you saw Speaker Ryans comments earlier today -- I think we can have this done legislatively sooner rather than later, but I think the implementation of a lot of the pieces may take a little bit longer.Its a big, big bill that the Democrats passed. As you recall, they told us we could read it after they passed it. We are now going through this to make sure that we do this in a very responsible way, to make sure that health care, which is so vital to so many Americans and their families, is preserved while we put a new system in place that both lowers costs and increases accessibility.But the President, I think, is very encouraged by the commitment and work thats going on on the Hill to make sure that we get this thing replaced as quick as possible.Fred Lucas.Q  Thanks, Sean. I wanted to ask -- actually, a follow-up related to that. Speaker Ryan has actually said -- and I'm quoting -- with Obamacare you cant tinker at the margins and repair it. You can't. It is a collapsing law."" Do you agree with that? And you cant build on whats already there, you have to get rid of the entire law?MR. SPICER: I think what were focused on is the end solution. And I think weve been very clear over and over again that the President is going to repeal and replace it, and that what Americans will get at the end of this is a health care solution that, as Ive said before over and over again, is going to give them a lower-cost health solution with more options. Thats what they were promised in the first place. Thats what we can give.And I think the President, being able to approach this in the businesslike manner that hes done so successfully in the past, is going to ensure that he negotiates prices, that we look at those business-like practices, force competition among states and other things that will help lower cost once and for all, and provide that competition. Q  On Iran sanctions, does the President have any concerns about the fact that Adam Szubin is the Acting Treasury Secretary in terms of implementing those sanctions?MR. SPICER: No. We implemented them -- they went off without a hitch.Fred -- I mean, John Decker.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. As you know, the President spoke over the weekend on Twitter and criticized the federal judge appointed by George W. Bush who imposed the nationwide restraining order. He called him a ""so-called judge."" Is the President, as it relates to the arguments -- I know you're confident -- but the arguments that will be presented this evening -- is he prepared to accept an adverse ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals?MR. SPICER: There's no question the President respects the judicial branch and its ruling, but I think that there's no way -- I just read off the U.S. code on that. I don't think there's any other way that you can interpret that, that the President has the discretion to do what's necessary to keep this country safe. And I think that's his concern, frankly, right now, is that when the law is such as it is, that anyone could interpret that any other way. I think he feels confident, just like in the ruling in Boston, that we're going to prevail on this on the merits of the case because it is done so in a very lawful way.Katherine.Q  Will the administration take a position on the Israeli legislation to retract or illegalize the thousands of West Bank settlements? Last week, obviously, you said building the settlements may not be helpful.MR. SPICER: I think that, as I mentioned last week -- and I don't want to get too far ahead of this -- but Prime Minister Netanyahu will be here on the 15th. I think that will be obviously a topic of discussion right now. I don't want to get ahead of that.Charlie Spiering.Q  Thanks, Sean. Just a quick question. Any response to the calls for impeachment by Representative Maxine Waters?MR. SPICER: No.Hunter Walker.I mean, I would just say, look, I think, look, it is -- the President is doing everything he can to move this country forward. And I think whether it's the Democrats in the Senate who are trying to stall these nominees or these little political stunts on the House side, the bottom line is, I think by and large you see the support that the President is receiving for his policies throughout the country. And it's because I think people recognize, A, that business as usual is over and that the President's commitment to both keeping this country safe, growing the economy and creating jobs is something that is welcomed by all Americans, regardless of party.I think when you see stuff like that, I think it really just shows that they really missed the message that voters sent this past November.Hunter Walker.Q  Thank you, Sean. CNN reportedly declined to interview Kellyanne Conway on Sunday because of the questions about her credibility. Is the White House willing to offer alternative representatives to networks that refuse to work with specific spokespeople?MR. SPICER: Well, frankly, I think that my understanding is they retracted that, they walked that back or denied it, however you want to put it -- I don't care. But I think Kellyanne is a very trusted aide of the President. I think for any characterization otherwise is insulting.I don't think -- if they choose not to work with someone, that's up to them. But I think we're going to continue to put out key leaders of this administration, including Kellyanne, that can articulate the President's policies and agenda.Katie Pavlich.Q  Thanks, Sean, for the question. Is President Trump planning to ask the Senate to expedite legislation allowing for the swift firing of bad VA employees?MR. SPICER: I think the President's commitment, as you heard both during the campaign and as he's talked to Dr. Shulkin, is to make sure that we're providing the best care. And if there's things that are an impediment to that care being offered up or reformed, then he is going to make sure that we enact policies internally that make sure that people who are not doing their job, not servicing veterans, we can figure out how to expedite that process.But the idea that we're sitting around having a discussion about personnel inhibiting the care that veterans deserve really does not bode well for the reflection that we want on this country. I mean, people who have served this nation -- we should be bending over backwards to make sure that the benefits and the care and the services that they, frankly, earned is something that is given the highest priority and is something that the President remains highly committed to.Miriam Borgess.Q  Hey, hi. The President is going to speak later today with the Spanish leader, Mariano Rajoy. And I would like to know how President Trump sees the relation with Spain, and which are the main issues they are going to discuss in their phone call.MR. SPICER: So I'm not going to -- we'll have a readout after the call, but I imagine that they're going to talk about a shared commitment to defeating ISIS and that they'll discuss our bilateral relationship and reaffirm our commitment to the two countries. I think we will have a readout on that call with Spain as we will with all the countries and all the other leaders that we will talk to and we have in the past. So I don't want to get too far ahead of it, but I would imagine that the current relationship that we have with Spain and our commitment to ISIS will be at the forefront of that.Maria Pea.Q  Yes, here, sorry. Thank you. It's kind of loud in here. So it's a two-part question. One, can you confirm whether or not the White House has accepted the credentials of the new Mexican ambassador, Gernimo Gutirrez? And also Representative Mike Rogers, I believe, this morning said that he plans to introduce a bill to impose a 2 percent tax on all remittances that Mexicans send to their country to pay for the wall. Would the President rally behind that bill?MR. SPICER: So, first, I would have to get back to you on the ambassadors credentials. I don't know. We could check with the Department of State and figure that out. I don't know that right off the top of my head. And Im not going to comment -- I don't -- we don't put out statements of administration policy until the bill has gone through the process.Hallie.Q  Two questions for you. One, following up on health care, the President, as you know, campaigned for 18 months on replacing the Affordable Care Act. Where is his plan?MR. SPICER: Hes working with Congress. I just answered that question. But hes working with Speaker Ryan. Let me -- you're acting like --Q  The specifics of it, though. I mean, does he owe the American people something now given --MR. SPICER: And I think hes been very clear that he owes the American people a result that's going to lower costs and provide more access. That's what he continues to work with Speaker Ryan on. I think the Speaker was very clear on it -- that they're having meetings both legislatively and at the principal level to make sure that this gets done.And I think as you heard Speaker Ryan, we continue to be optimistic about getting this thing completed by this year. Its a mammoth bill what they passed and did it -- and I think we've got to make sure that we do this right. We don't want to end up with the same result that Democrats did. They rushed it through. No one was able to read the bill. And premiums have skyrocketed; access and options have gone down. We need to make sure that we don't do this in a way that's going to end up with the same result.John Roberts.Q  I have a question for you, Sean, though, on Yemen. MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  I did say two.Q  One of the worlds most wanted terrorists is now taunting President Trump, calling him a fool after that raid.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  Any response from the White House? And do you still stand by your characterization that it was a successful raid?MR. SPICER: Absolutely. That -- he was not -- that was -- the raid that was conducted in Yemen was an intelligence-gathering raid. That's what it was. It was highly successful. It achieved the purpose it was going to get -- save the loss of life that we suffered and the injuries that occurred. The goal --Q  So you're pushing back on reporting that he was a target?MR. SPICER: Absolutely. He was not -- the goal of the raid was intelligence-gathering. And that's what we received, and that's what we got. That's why we can deem it a success.John Roberts.Q  If -- and I know that you believe that you have a good case on the merits to lift the temporary restraining order. If the President does not prevail at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, will he take this to the Supreme Court? MR. SPICER: Lets see where we go. I think he made it very clear that --Q  Can I just finish? MR. SPICER: Yes, you can. Im sorry.Q  And is he concerned that if this does go to the Supreme Court with its current 4-4 makeup, that this temporary restraining order might become a little more permanent? MR. SPICER: Well, remember tonight is about just a restraining order. We're not --Q  I know what it's about. That's not the question.MR. SPICER: Right, I understand. But I think that its important to explain this to everyone, John, because I know you get it and so many others -- but I just want to make sure. Tonight is about the restraining order. It has nothing to do with the merits of the case. And that's why I think we feel confident. The question is: Does the restraining order get lifted or not? But regardless of what happens tonight, the merits of the case still need to be -- to discuss. And I think the merits of the case, as they were in Boston, are ones that we feel very confident on because the law is crystal clear on this. The President has the authority to do this. It was done so in an interagency process that ensured that all the appropriate people were consulted. We went through that with flying colors. I have zero concern that at the end of the day, well be fine. Its just a question of going through the process.Q  And I get all that, as you pointed it out. But if he does not prevail at the 9th Circuit, will he take this case to the Supreme Court?MR. SPICER: Im not going to get -- lets see where it goes first. I think our goal right now is to get to a point we can argue it on the merits. We feel confident, based on how the Court has reacted in Massachusetts, that we're going to be good on the merits.Jonathan Swan.Q  Thanks for the question. Does President Trump still plan to immediately terminate President Obamas executive amnesties?MR. SPICER: With respect to what, DACA and DAPA?Q  DAPA.MR. SPICER: Ive said this before, well have further updates on that. Go ahead.Q  But just in the thing, it said ""immediately terminate."" MR. SPICER: I understand that. Q  So I just wondered what the delay is.MR. SPICER: And Ive made it -- and Ive said before the President will have further updates on both DACA and DAPA very shortly. We've been very clear on immigration -- what the Presidents priorities would be. As you heard Secretary Kelly testify in front of Congress today, there is going to be continued progress on the wall and on immigration as a whole. So we're going to have plenty of time to address this. Right now, hes trying to do it in a very systematic way in accordance to where we find the biggest problems. And so hes been very clear in the past that those who are in this country that pose a threat to us or with a criminal record are where his priorities are going to be first and foremost, and were going to move through the rest of folks that are in this country illegally.Sarah.Q  Thank you, Sean. Back to Iran. The Ayatollah Khamenei said today that Trump has helped Iran reveal the true face of America. He said Iran doesnt fear Trump, and he encouraged Iranians to march in the street against America later this week. Does the President have a response to those very aggressive comments? And does he plan to take additional action against Iran if its leaders continue to escalate tensions?MR. SPICER: I think the President -- or the Ayatollah is going to realize that there is a new President in office. This President is not going to sit by and let Iran flout its violations, or its apparent violations to the joint agreement.But he will continue to take action as he sees fit. The President has also made clear time and time again that hes not going to project what those actions will be, and he will not take anything off the table. But I think Iran is kidding itself if they dont realize that there is a new President in town.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. On Thursday, weather permitting, the President is going to meet with airline executives from throughout the country. Two complaints from airline executives, as well as the Pilots Association, have been, one, that Norwegian Airlines got a special advantage, a foreign carrier permit from the Obama administration, and also that the airlines of the Arab Emirates are state-subsidized, and both cases are violations of the Blue Skies Act between the U.S. and the EU. Is this something hes going to address? And is he considering upending President Obamas foreign carrier permit?MR. SPICER: Well, again, that will be something that -- that will be decided when they meet, what theyll talk about. Obviously, the President is going to want to talk about economic growth and job creation, how hes enacting orders to make sure the country is safe.On the case of Norwegian, my understanding, if Im correct, that there is a deal in which theyre having 50 percent of the crews and the pilots are American-based. Theyre flying Boeing planes. There is a huge economic interest that America has in that deal right now. I dont want to get ahead of the President on that. But just to be clear, I mean, when youre talking about U.S. jobs, both in terms of the people who are serving those planes and the person whos building those planes. Thats a very big difference.Zeke.Q  Thanks, Sean. A few minutes ago you said that the President wanted to remind the American people of how prevalent terrorist attacks are and that the Earth is a dangerous place. That kind of breaks with the rhetoric weve seen bipartisan administrations use when it comes to terrorist attacks, encouraging the American people to go about their daily lives. MR. SPICER: That's not the point that -- no, no, no, --Q  Does this President have a different message to the American people?MR. SPICER: I think, yeah, his message to the American people is that he is fully committed to doing everything that he can to keep the country safe. And I think that theres a big difference between what youre saying and the point that he was making yesterday. And I think that what hes getting at is making -- he was making a point as to the exposure that attacks get. And I think thats what he was getting at, is that we see these things and theyre becoming too prevalent. And thats why I think he wants to become ever vigilant to make sure that we dont ever get lax, that we need to be reminded that places and groups like ISIS continue to seek to do us harm, and that it is his job as Commander-in-Chief to do everything he can to get ahead of the curve and keep this country safe.I think when you look at the poll that came out last week -- and I think it was 67 percent of the American people agree with his proposition to put further restrictions on people, to make sure that we have countries who are sending people to our country that they are coming here for peaceful purposes, and that if we cant guarantee those countries have the proper vetting and systems in place when they are outbound to the United States, then we need to do what we can, and he will do what he has to as President, to make sure that this country is safe.So I think there is a -- the point that he was making was not to put fear in anybody, but to, rather, reassure them that as President of the United States he is taking every single step to do what he has to to get ahead of the threats, to get ahead of the concerns so were not looking in the rearview mirror thinking, what should we have done, what could we have done; that were preventing lives -- whether its the raid in Yemen, the law that hes enacting -- that hes going to do what he can to make sure that this homeland and our people are protected and safe.Mara.Q  Thank you. I just have two questions. One on a tweet and one on health care. When the President tweeted, If something happens, blame the judge and the court system, did he mean if a terrorist attack is committed by somebody from these seven countries? Or any terrorist attack should be blamed on the judge and the court system?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the point that he -- the tweet is pretty clear. But I think his point is, is that -- kind of dovetails what I was just saying to Zeke -- hes doing everything he can. And he walks into office -- there are seven countries that the Obama administration has already identified as not having the proper systems in place to guarantee our safety -- and I think his immediate reaction is to do what he has to do to make sure that were not looking back and saying, you know what we should have done, we should have made sure that we had stricter vetting in place for those seven countries.So he took immediate and decisive action to make sure that this country and our people were protected. Thats what hes talking about, is making sure that we dont have regret, that a month from now or two months from now or a year from now we hadnt done something to protect people. And so he acted as quick and decisively as possible to make sure that we put the systems in place to protect our people. And I dont think theres any other way to read that.Q  A question on health care. Can I just get my second question?MR. SPICER: Of course.Q  You just said hell negotiate prices, and thats something he -- he ran on negotiating prices for Medicare, drug prices. And I just want you to clarify where he is on that, because when he met with big pharma the other day, before the meeting he said, we have no choice, we have to get prices down. After the meeting he said he would oppose anything that makes it harder for these companies to bring their drugs to market, including price fixing by Medicare. So is he for Medicare negotiating drug prices, or not?MR. SPICER: Hes for it, yes. He wants to make sure -- Q  Hes still for it.MR. SPICER: Absolutely.Q  Okay.MR. SPICER: The President is clear -- I mean, when you look at the costs of -- not just drug costs. The U.S. government has not done -- I mean, you look at what -- frankly, the easier way to look at this is what other countries have done -- negotiating costs to keep those down. As drug prices continue to escalate, that drives up health care costs for every American. But particularly, theres a huge burden on Americas seniors who are so much more reliant on drug prices. And in many cases you have people living on a fix income. And health care costs -- rising health care costs and prescription drugs continue to be a burden on their ability to live out their lives in a much more enjoyable manner.And so his commitment is to make sure that he does what he can, and I think rather successfully uses his skills as a businessman to drive them down.Margaret.Q  Sean, can you clarify two things? MR. SPICER: Sure.Q  One, Secretary Kerry -- Kelly, excuse me, when he was on the Hill today said that the administration right now is not looking at adding other countries to this temporary travel ban list. Is the White House still giving itself room to add some countries to that list?MR. SPICER: Well, I think what his point was is, is that right now, hes not doing it. You have to look at his testimony in context. I think he went through the fact that were still in this review process, that he is committed to making sure that we look at all other countries. But as of this moment, there is no immediate desire to add to that, but he is looking at all of the other countries, the procedures that we have with them, the systems we have in place to check them. And so nothing is final until the end of the review period. Q  But I had a second question, sorry. So you said still leaving room to do that. Something that the President continues to say as a phrase -- and Im hoping you can define it for us -- is that this is about testing who truly loves America and making sure that those who enter the country are those who truly love America. How do you quantify that? What is the President thinking of? Is that a specific test? What does that mean?MR. SPICER: No, I mean -- look, I think theres a -- I think the Presidents goal is to make sure that people arent coming here to do us harm; that they're going through the proper extreme vetting in cases where we don't have the information required to make a good judgment on them based on what their country is willing to provide; that we are taking the proper and necessary steps to protect our people.But he doesn't -- if someone is coming here to do us harm or to espouse things that would give us a good indication that they're not coming here for the right reasons, then we need to do everything we can to, A, vet them and, B, unless we're 100 percent certain, keep them out of the country.Q  It's a background check.MR. SPICER: It's a background check. But again, I wouldn't just -- it's not. I mean, it is -- to the extent that we can, it's going to be extreme vetting is what he's talked about; that it's not going to be just letting someone in on a quick check. If there's any cause for concern, he wants to go to every step possible to make sure that people who are entering this country are doing so because they want to come here for the right reasons and for peaceful reasons.Yeah.Q  Thank you, Sean. On South Korea, South Korea knows about Trump is very good friend of theirs. And the (inaudible) most important part of his policy on South Korea?MR. SPICER: What will what, please?Q  What was most important part of Trump's policy towards South Korea?Q  The most important part of the policy --MR. SPICER: Thank you. Look, he had a conversation the other day and we look forward to filling that conversation. I think obviously the threat of North Korea is the most prominent issue that faces South Korea in our alliance right now. He wants to reassure the South Korean government, the Blue House, that we are going to do what we can to make sure that we stand with South Korea and that we prevent any further hostile actions from North Korea.So I think that the safety of our country, of South Korea, of the region are going to be clearly the greatest focus of this.Q  John-Christopher, Talk-Media News. When the President submits his budget, is he committed to pushing Congress to approve sufficient funding for all American students to have either an outstanding public school education or the public funding for them to reach an outstanding private school education?MR. SPICER: Look, I think the President has talked extensively about education during the primary, whether it's an Associate's Degree, a Bachelor's Degree, a PhD or vo-technical education that we've got to give students these days the options they need for the workforce; that a vo-tech education in some cases is what's in the interest of students in terms of their success, and giving them the skills to work on cars or become a computer engineer or whatever. But as we head into -- as we look towards the future, we've got to make sure that we're preparing our students to have the skillset that they need. And it's also the retraining aspect of that -- that as people get older and certain industries start to turn the corner because of technology, that we're allowing people the opportunity for retraining to give them the skillset that they need to reenter the workforce and continue to be productive.So I think as you will see -- look, we literally will swear in the Secretary of Education hopefully later this evening, which we will let you all know -- probably around the 5:00 or 6:00 hour. But that will be something that he's going to continue to have a conversation with Secretary DeVos about. Something that she's made clear -- and it's unfortunate that we haven't been able to have this conversation sooner because it was held up for so long -- but I think that's something that Secretary DeVos will be speaking a lot about, about the education funding and skillset and opportunities that we give not just our children but people older in life who are looking to get back into the workforce through another avenue.Q  How about the K-12? How about the youngsters?MR. SPICER: I think we'll have plenty of time to discuss the President's budget as we get closer -- as he sort of develops that. Today, we're excited that Secretary DeVos will get sworn in. Thanks a lot, guys. Have a great one. Take care.END2:19 P.M.

99,2017-02-07,IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: McClatchy On Historical Precedent For President’s National Security Executive Order,"Six of the last seven presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have relied on the same federal law to keep certain groups of foreigners out of the United States.Trump Is Not The First President To Ban Foreigners. So Why Is This Time Different?McClatchyAnita KumarFebruary 6, 2017http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/white-house/article131121184.htmlDonald Trumps travel ban isnt new.Six of the last seven presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, have relied on the same federal law to keep certain groups of foreigners out of the United States.Jimmy Carter denied entry to Iranians in April 1980 after a failed rescue mission for American hostages in Iran. Ronald Reagan barred migrants arriving at the borders from the high seas in September 1981, targeting Haitians and Cubans. Bill Clinton in November 1999 barred those responsible for repressing civilians in Kosovo. And George W. Bush in June 2001 banned those who planned or carried out wartime atrocities in the Western Balkans.In general, all presidents have used executive orders to impact immigration policy, said Clete Samson, an immigration attorney who spent years as a federal trial attorney for the Department of Homeland Security.In each case, the presidents relied on 8 U.S.C. 1182(f), a statute that gives them wide latitude over who can come into the country.Whenever the president finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate, the law says.Trump cited the law when issuing his executive order last month that froze refugee admissions and temporarily blocked people from seven Muslim-majority countries  Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  from entering the United States, even with valid visas.Critics call Trumps order a Muslim ban, the same one he spoke of on the campaign trail. But the White House pushes back on the label, saying the nations were not chosen because they are Muslim majority. More than 40 countries that are Muslim-majority were not included in the ban.Congress has given the office of the president broad power to suspend entry of foreign nationals when doing so would be in the national interest, said Raj Shah, deputy communications director at the White House. President Trump acted well within his authority and in a manner also exercised by previous presidents in similar ways.Most recently, President Barack Obama in August 2011 banned immigrants who had committed or participated in war crimes, crimes against humanity, violations of human rights or violence against any civilian population based on race, color, descent, sex and a host of other conditions that ranged from disability to membership in a particular social group.The United States enduring commitment to respect for human rights and humanitarian law requires that its government be able to ensure that the United States does not become a safe haven for serious violators of human rights and humanitarian law and those who engage in other related abuses, he wrote in his order.[W]hite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on Monday dismissed suggestions that the administration could withdraw the order and rewrite it.Clearly the law is on the presidents side, he said. The Constitution is on the presidents side. He has broad discretion to do whats in the nations best interest to protect our people.Click Here to view full article.",20090.29,37.87000000000262,5674.22,10.670000000000073,2293.08,0.5199999999999818

Res. 42  Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Labor Relating to Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants(Rep. Brady, R-TX, and 25 cosponsors)H.J.

Rokita, R-IN, and 12 cosponsors)H.J. Res. 58  Disapproving the Rule Submitted by the Department of Education Relating to Teacher Preparation Issues(Rep. Guthrie, R-KY, and 12 cosponsors)The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations. The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act establish onerous reporting requirements and other constraints on States, local communities, and institutions of higher education.H.J. Res. 42 would nullify the Employment and Training Administration's Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Program; Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 Provision on Establishing Appropriate Occupations for Drug Testing of Unemployment Compensation Applicants 81 Fed. Reg. 50298 (August 1, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Labor. The rule determines the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for use by States when determining which unemployment insurance applicants may be tested. The ruleimposes an arbitrarily narrow definition of occupations and constrains a State's ability to conduct a drug testing program in its unemployment insurance system, as authorized in Public Law 112-96, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.H.J. Res. 44 would nullify the final rule relating to Resource Management Planning, 81 Fed. Reg. 89580 (Dec. 12, 2016), promulgated by the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This rule, also known as the BLM Planning Rule 2.0, would prioritize regional and national considerations over state and local interests in land use planning for activities on public lands. The BLM manages over 245 million acres of Federal lands, located mostly in the western States, for multiple uses, including grazing, timber, recreation, and energy and mineral development. Given its regional approach to planning, the Administration believes the rule does not adequately serve the State and local communities interests and could potentially dilute their input in planning decisions.H.J. Res. 57 would nullify the final rule Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as Amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act  Accountability and State Plans, 81 Fed. Reg. 86076 (Nov. 29, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes requirements for how States must implement the statutory provisions that require States to have an accountability system based on multiple measures, including school quality or student success, to ensure that States and districts focus on improving outcomes and measuring student progress. While school accountability is important, the Administration is committed to local control of education and this rule places additional burden on States and constrains them in areas where the ESSA intended broad flexibility. The Administration looks forward to working with the Congress on how the Department of Education can support States and school districts as they implement the new reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.H.J. Res. 58 would nullify the final rule related to the Teacher Preparation Program Accountability System, 81 Fed. Reg. 75494 (Oct. 31, 2016), promulgated by the Department of Education. This rule establishes annual State reporting to measure the performance and quality of teacher preparation programs and tie them to program eligibility for participation in the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education grant program. The rule imposes new burdensome and costly data reporting requirements on States and institutions of higher education.If these bills were presented to the President in their current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign them into law.",20090.29,37.87000000000262,5674.22,10.670000000000073,2293.08,0.5199999999999818

102,2017-02-08,Remarks by President Trump and Intel CEO Brian Krzanich on U.S. Jobs,"Oval Office 12:52 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: You've never seen so much paper on a Presidents desk. (Laughter.) That's because we're negotiating lots of deals for our country, which will be tremendous. And I just want to introduce Brian Krzanich, who's the CEO of Intel, a great, great company. And Brian called a few weeks ago and said, we want to do a very big announcement having to do with our country, but also having to do mostly with Arizona, and the jobs and the great technology that will be produced.So this is Brian. And, Brian, why don't you say a few words and maybe also talk about the product you're going to be making. Its amazing.MR. KRZANICH: Yes. Thank you, Mr. President, for this. Its an honor to be here today representing Intel and to be able to announce our $7 billion investment in our newest, most advanced factory -- Fab 42 in Chandler, Arizona. Well be completing that factory to make the most advanced 7-nanometer semiconductor chips on the planet.Intel is very proud of the fact that the majority of our manufacturing is here in the U.S. and the majority of our research and development is here in the U.S., while over 80 percent of what we sell is sold outside of the U.S. And we're consistently one of the top five exporters in the country and one of the top two research and development spenders in the United States. And we've been able to do that even while the regulatory and tax policies have disadvantaged us in the past relative to the competition we have across the world. And Fab 42 is an investment in Intel, but also the U.S.s future in innovation and leadership in the semiconductor industry. Fab 42 will employ approximately 3,000 direct high-paying, high-wage, high-tech jobs at its peak, and over 10,000 people in the Arizona area in support of the factory. And this factory will produce, as I said, the most powerful computer chips on the planet, powering the best computers, the best data centers, autonomous cars. All of these devices are the most powerful computing devices on the planet.And at Intel we have a simple saying that says, while other people predict the future, we build the future. And this factory is a great example of that.I want to thank the President for this opportunity to be here today.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Brian. And you have something over there. Show a little bit about the new product.MR. KRZANICH: This is an example of the wafer that will be built in Fab 42. This is one of our newest 10-nanometer silicon wafers. Seven-nanometers will be built in Fab 42. And this is the future of computing.THE PRESIDENT: That's great, thanks. Do you have any questions for Brian? I know you have none for me, so how about -- (laughter) -- Q  Are you going to bring back jobs? The other business you have outside the country, do you plan on bringing them back here?MR. KRZANICH: This is actually expansion. This is about growth. So this position is actually about growth and new jobs in the U.S.THE PRESIDENT: Great thing for Arizona. Unbelievable company and product, and we're very happy. And I can tell you the people of Arizona are very happy. Its a lot of jobs. Probably the investment -- what are you saying, your total investment will be what?MR. KRZANICH: Total investment in just this factory is $7 billion. But if you take Arizona, we already have two other factories in Arizona. So we have several tens of billions of dollars of investments in factories in Arizona. We're the number-one private employer in Arizona.Q  And how long have you been planning this investment?MR. KRZANICH: We've been working on this factory for several years. We held off actually doing this investment until now.Q  Was there something that President Trump did or said that made you want to announce this here and now?MR. KRZANICH: Its really in support of the tax and regulatory policies that we see the administration pushing forward that really make it advantageous to do manufacturing in the U.S.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, all.

103,2017-02-08,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/8/2017, #10","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:48 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. Just a few minutes ago, as many of you had seen, we had another example of the real-world results that the Trump administration is getting in its pro-jobs agenda. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich announced that his company is opening a high-tech manufacturing facility in Arizona that will create roughly 10,000 jobs between the factory itself and its supply chain, which is the latest wave in economic optimism that's sweeping the country following the President's victory.In his inaugural address, the President laid out an ambitious vision to create 25 million jobs over the next decade. From the beginning of his campaign, bringing jobs back to our struggling community has been one of the parts of the President's message that most resonated with the American people. Having hired tens of thousands of people himself, the President is keenly aware of what prevents businesses from being successful and creating jobs in the current economy.President Obama, by contrast, visited the same factory site where this factory will be built during his last reelection visit in 2012, touting the government incentives that were supposed to bring back jobs that had been lost to Asia. President Trump knows that for business, the real government incentive is the government restraining itself. For too many years, Washington has smothered industry in this country and under burdensome regulation. This administration will set out to free businesses from constraints of government bureaucracy and regulation. Under the President's ""Buy American, Hire American"" agenda, the government is going to get out of the way of businesses to allow them to thrive. Just last week, the President signed what we've been calling the ""one in, two out"" executive order requiring that every new federal regulation that's adopted, two be eliminated. This new rule will provide much-needed relief for businesses who have been regulated and saddled with an absolutely staggering amount of additional red tape, as much as $1.9 trillion per year by some estimates. In 2014, the National Association of Manufacturers calculated that companies in every industry paid an average of $9,991 per employee to comply with federal regulations. And it's only gotten worse since that study was conducted. By relieving even a small portion of this burden, we will allow businesses to grow and hire more people. Projects that have been stalled or scuttled are being revived in anticipation of the President's pro-growth policies. Last quarter, confidence among CEOs of U.S.-based companies jumped by 4.2 percent points in the YPO Global Pulse Survey, one of the single-largest quarter gains in history. This is only the beginning of the President's agenda.Moving on to recap the President's afternoon and evening yesterday, as you saw, we officially announced the 24 people who will be serving in the President's -- in his Cabinet, on the White House website yesterday. The President looks forward to having all these distinguished qualified men and women in place as heads of departments and agencies so that our government can start fully working for the American people and enacting the agenda that he brought forward during the last campaign.The President spoke with two foreign leaders yesterday. During his call with President Rajoy of Spain, the two leaders discussed our shared priorities, including efforts to eliminate ISIS. The President additionally reiterated the United States' commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and emphasized the importance of NATO allies and sharing the burden of defense spending. President Trump also spoke with President Erdogan of Turkey, during which he conveyed U.S. support to Turkey as a strategic partner and NATO ally, and welcomed Turkey's contributions to the fight against ISIS.Last night, the President had an incredibly meaningful visit with current officers who enrolled in the Green Beret's Qualifications Course. These young men and women will be at the tip of the spear serving our country in some of the world's most dangerous places as intelligence officers. The President told these brave young soldiers how proud he was of their commitment, to risk everything to keep us safe, and how humbled he was to serve as their Commander-in-Chief, and that they could always count on him to have their back.Also, yesterday, the Department of Justice presented its arguments before the 9th Circuit Court in the case concerning the temporary restraining order on the President's national security executive order. Again, as I did yesterday, I want to emphasize that the issue before the 9th Circuit right now is extremely narrow. The question is simply whether or not the President's executive order, which we maintain is fully lawful under the Constitution and U.S. code, should remain in effect while the courts actually consider it on its merits. We expect the court to issue a decision on this matter soon, and we will have a statement once that's done.Today, the President spoke before the Major Cities police chiefs and the Major County Sheriffs Winter Conference. In his remarks, the President reiterated his commitment to a great national partnership between his administration and law enforcement. While there are many things that the federal government can do to improve safety in our communities, it truly rests with the police officers, sheriffs and deputies who risk their lives every day on our streets. And their mission is critical to the future of this country. These brave men and women have a true friend in the White House. And as the President said many times, we must protect those who protect us. He will continue to do that throughout his administration. Later this afternoon, the President will participate in a standing legislative strategy meeting of his team here. The team has been working around the clock to engage lawmakers and get the President's agenda moving through Congress. Yesterday, the Vice President attended the Republican Policy lunch where he discussed how the administration will work with the Senate to deliver results for the American people. Of course, the Vice President also cast a historic vote for Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos on the floor of the Senate, and then later swore her in in his office across the street. The larger intergovernmental affairs team is maintaining direct communications to state, local and tribal leaders so that we know what issues are affecting local communities. So far, they've contacted all GOP state speakers of the house, state senate presidents, and attorneys general, and all but eight GOP state Senate majority leaders. Our legislative team is also obviously engaged in Judge Gorsuch's nomination. He had another full day of meetings in the Senate with both Republicans and Democrats. He met this morning with Senators Flake and Heitkamp. And this afternoon he'll meet with Senators Cotton, Blumenthal, McCaskill and Heller. We're also pleased to see another Democrat, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, come out and say that the eminently qualified Judge Gorsuch deserves an up or down vote. That brings up now to nine total Democrats who have come out and expressed a willingness to treat Judge Gorsuch fairly. We hope more Democrats will continue to join their colleagues in fulfilling their constitutional duty to offer advice and consent on the President's nominee.Also, on the Hill, we expect Attorney General-designate Sessions to receive a full vote on the floor of the Senate tonight. As unfortunately has become commonplace in the Senate, Democrats once again spent hours last night in a counterproductive discussion about one of President's clearly qualified nominees, not to mention one of their peers. Senator Sessions has a long and distinguished legal career, serving as both the U.S. attorney of the southern district of Alabama, and also as Alabama's attorney general.The President looks forward to Senator Sessions's return to the Department of Justice where he will continue his service to our nation as our chief law enforcement officer. We also anticipate votes later this week on Secretary-designate Price and Mnuchin.Finally, before I open it up for questions, the White House has spoken with the governor of Louisiana about the severe where in the Gulf Coast. We've also made contact with the mayors of the affected areas. FEMA is monitoring the situation around the clock and is in the process of deploying teams to support response and recovery activities. At this time, there have been no additional requests for federal assistance, and we'll update you should that change.With that, let me go to the first question from Courtis Fuller from WLWT NBC in Cincinnati, Ohio. Q  Good afternoon. Cincinnati, among other cities, has recently voted to become a sanctuary city. City leaders here are vowing not to enforce federal immigration laws without a specific request. They also say they want to be open and welcoming to refugees. My question today: How will President Trump respond? Will Cincinnati face economic or other sanctions, including, for example, funding of the Brent Spence Bridge, which he said he would fund when he was on the campaign trail?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Courtis. As I've noted before, at the end of the day, this order is about two things: one, keeping our cities safe, and two, respecting the hard-earned taxpayers who send their money to the federal government. And the President is going to do everything he can within the scope of the executive order to make sure that cities who dont comply with it -- counties and other institutions that remain sanctuary cities dont get federal government funding in compliance with the executive order. I think more areas like Miami-Dade, down in Florida, understand the importance of this order, and we hope cities like Cincinnati and other communities around the country follow their lead and comply with that.With that, Anita Kumar.Q  I have two questions. The first one is, can you tell us who is paying or how this is happening with Prime Minister Abes visit to Mar-a-Lago? Who will be paying for that? I asked the White House yesterday. They referred me to State. State referred me to the Japanese government who didnt respond. It seems as if the Prime Minister was paying and the money was going to Treasury, as previously discussed before.MR. SPICER: You mean when he travels here or to Florida?Q  Mar-a-Lago.MR. SPICER: Okay.Q  Then it seems the White House would know that.MR. SPICER: Yeah, and let me get back to you on that. Well follow up with you on the exact financing. Im not sure how that flows, but Id be glad to find out.Q  Okay. Second question was, during the hearing yesterday that you talked about -- 9th Circuit -- there was some discussion about whether there needed to be a tweak to the executive order to make it clear that legal permanent residents would not be included in that, and there was some back and forth on that. Will there be a tweak? Q  I think there was further guidance that I spoke about that went out, I think its been a week ago -- correct me if Im wrong -- and talked about, we wanted to make it very, very clear that legal permanent residents were not included in that. But again, remember, were not talking about the merits of the order. Right now, this discussion that happened last night and that the court will be ruling on is specific to the temporary restraining order and whether or not it should be maintained until theres a further discussion on the merits.So again, I dont want to get into the legal nuances, but right now the guidance is very clear that was issued several days ago, if not a week ago, that this is not about legal permanent residents. So I just -- that they are excluded from this, and I dont know why there would be that discussion. That clarification has been made.Jeff.Q  Sean, you said youre not talking about the merits of the order. Was the President this morning talking about the merits of the order when he called it disgraceful, the hearing that he heard last night?MR. SPICER: He wasnt arguing before the 9th Circuit, Jeff. Last night was a motion before the 9th Circuit on the temporary restraining order. I think the President was very clear that U.S. code and the Constitution clearly give the President all the authority that is needed to make sure that he can regulate who comes into this country and prevent any acts of -- you know, anyone who is not coming to this country in a peaceful manner.The code, 8 U.S. Code 1152* [1182], is very, very clear on this. And so I think the President was pointing out the same issue that we had in Boston, which is, once we had a chance to argue it on the merits, we won on it. And so I think thats what hes -- he clearly did not argue in front of the 9th Circuit last night. So --Q  But he called it disgraceful. By calling it disgraceful, is that the type of language that should be used between branches of government?MR. SPICER: I think that the President, when you look at the U.S. code and how clear its written and the authority and power it gives the President to do what is necessary to keep this country safe and regulate who comes into this country, I think its a very, very clear reading, and the President was very -- I think he further went on and said, it doesnt matter what level of education youre at, I dont think you could misread this.So I think --Q  But isnt that insulting an appointee to the federal bench?MR. SPICER: I think he was very clear, Jeff. So thank you. Daniel Halper.Q  I was curious about the tweet that President Trump -- about his daughters brand, and then it was retweeted by the POTUS account. Whats the standard that the President is doing in regards to his family businesses or that businesses --MR. SPICER: Well, I think this was less about his family business and an attack on his daughter. He ran for President. He won. Hes leading this country. And I think for people to take out their concern about his actions or his executive order on members of his family, he has every right to stand up for his family and applaud their business activities, their success. So, look, when it comes to his family, I think hes been very clear how proud he is of what they do and what theyve accomplished, and for someone to take out their concern with his policies on a family member of his is just -- is not acceptable, and the President has every right as a father to stand up for them.I'm going to go to Norma Garcia from KXTX.Q  Thank you. In Texas there is a big push to penalize sanctuary cities. In this state and other states around the country, there is a growing concern among undocumented immigrants whose lives are deeply rooted in the United States and have no criminal records. My question is, is this administration ready to tackle comprehensive immigration reform? If so, can you give us a timeline for it? If not, what is the plan to deal with undocumented immigrants who live in this country long term?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Norma. I think this has come up several times. I don't think that anybody doubts the President's concern or priority that is placed on immigration. He has talked about it -- when you talk about a comprehensive approach, he has talked about building a wall, he's talked about making sure we go after criminals in this country, he's talked about walking through the process and addressing DACA and DAPA in time. I think this is a big problem. There is no question that both on the security side and on reforming the current immigration system that is so clearly broken, that he is walking through this already, both in terms of executive action and then will continue to work through Congress.So to your question about the timeline, I think he's already enacting several pieces of it and he's going to work with Congress to get further down that.Eamon Javers.Q  Sean --MR. SPICER: Hallie.Q  Two here. Playing off of questions from Daniel here, on the business activities that you describe the President taking offense to, Nordstrom has come out and says this was not a political decision, it was a business decision. Ivanka Trump, as you know, has said she has divorced herself, separated herself from the business. So how is she being treated unfairly if she's not part of --MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's clearly a targeting of her brand, and it's her name still out there. So she's not directly running the company, it's still her name on it and there's clearly efforts to undermine that name based on her father's positions on particular policies that he's taken. This is a direct attack on his policies and her name. And so there is clearly an attempt for him to stand up for her because she is being maligned because they have a problem with his policies.John Roberts.Q  Sean, just a second -- actually, to clarify that, the timing of that tweet? It looked like it was right after his PDB -- during? Can you just --MR. SPICER: I've heard the conjecture. He was free when that happened. Thank you for asking.Q  Second question was on the lawsuit --MR. SPICER: No, that's two.Q  Oh, I'm sorry, that was a clarification of the one. (Laughter.) Q  Good, Hallie.Q  The President tweeted today that if he does not prevail in the court, talking about the lawsuit issue, that we will never be safe, we will never have the safety and security we're entitled to. What does that mean? Does that mean that this is the only tool in his toolbox and if this EO gets batted down by the courts, we're toast?MR. SPICER: No. But I think that when you -- and I mean, again, let's -- 8 U.S. Code 1182 says whenever the President finds that the entry of an alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation such periods as he shall deem necessary suspend the entry of aliens or any class of aliens or immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens restrictions he may deem necessary and appropriate. I guess at some point, if you don't look at that statute and say that the President has the power that Congress and the President have deemed necessary to keep this country safe, you've got to wonder how far you're going to allow that to get eroded.So the point is, is that at some area, you've got to wonder if the President isn't able to execute on the power that's been vested into him and is codified in U.S. code, at some point you have to wonder what else is at question. We have a President that acted 100 percent lawfully to keep people out of this country from seven countries that we did not have the proper information to ensure they were coming into this country with the appropriate means and motives. If at some point the President doesn't have the power, as given to him in law, to protect this country, I think that really questions what a slippery slope we're on.John.Q  Sean, two questions.MR. SPICER: Of course. (Laughter.) Q  The President said this morning that he paid very close attention to the arguments before the 9th last night.MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  But was he happy with the presentation that the DOJ attorney, August Flentje, made? There was some concern by supporters of this extreme vetting program that he wasnt strong enough. He seemed to be searching for answers, particularly on the point of standing.MR. SPICER: I think there was a lot of back and forth during that entire argument. He made some solid points, and I think that he did what he had to represent the Presidents case and to represent the administrations case on the TRO.I think the President has really focused on the merits of this case, and looking forward to getting it back either to the 9th Circuit or to the lower court, or however it has to move. He feels very confident on the merits, and that's where I think his focus has been.So I don't -- Im not concerned. I think the Presidents main concern has been on the merits of this case and making sure that an executive order that was lawfully executed and went through the entire process -- remember we've got to go back and remember that the DOJs Office of Legal Compliance vetted this order, deemed it was legal. So we've followed the entire process to make sure that this was done correctly, constitutionally, legally, and every otherwise.And so to now -- now our focus is making sure, whether or not we have to wait a day or two or whatever for the TRO, we look forward to the opportunity to discuss this on the merits.Jen Jacobs.Q  Whoa, whoa, whoa -- sorry. Hold on. Just as a point of clarification -- Ive got a question --MR. SPICER: Now you're going with Halle's --Q  So he is -- he was happy with his presentation --MR. SPICER: I think he is looking forward to the merits of this discussion. That's where -- and I think he was pleased with some of the points that got made. But his focus is on the merits of the order and making sure that ultimately we're able to do what we can to get this order back in place and protect the American people. Jen.Q  The Muslim Brotherhood --Q  Question two. MR. SPICER: Look at what Hallie started. (Laughter.) Q  We have reported that Russia has sent its biggest shipment of missiles ever to Syria. Just wondering what the White Houses reaction is.MR. SPICER: I think I'll have to -- we don't have any comment on this at this time.Jen.Q  The Muslim Brotherhood. Is it accurate that the administration is weighing -- labeling the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization? And will you do the same for Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard?MR. SPICER: I think there is no one that can question the Presidents commitment to fully attacking and addressing the threat that we face by radical Islamic terrorism. He has been -- made very clear during the campaign that the first step is understanding, knowing, and proclaiming who the enemy is. And hes going to do whatever it takes.That being said, Im not going to get ahead of any announcements that we may or may not have coming in the near future. But make no mistake, the President understands the threat that our nation faces, and hes going to do everything he can to attack it, root it out, and destroy it.Cecilia.Q  Thank you. The President also said today that in the last two weeks hes learned a lot, and that terrorism is far greater -- and that terrorism is a far greater threat than people understand. That sounds like he is telling the American public that they have something to fear. Is there a specific threat that he is talking about? And should the American public -- based on that statement right there -- be fearful?MR. SPICER: No. But I think the American people should understand that the President is committed to doing this. We face a very, very real threat in ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism, and that we've got to do everything he can, and that the reason that he is taking the steps that he is, is because we must remain ever vigilant. We can't let our guard down. We have to be ahead of the curve. And that the President is going to take the steps necessary to protect this country and its people. And that the idea that we should sit back and not fully appreciate the constant threat that we're in, its week after week, month after month that we're hearing of another instance -- a lone wolf, et cetera, et cetera -- that is going throughout this country -- excuse me, throughout the world. My apologies.And so I think what the President is doing is trying to make sure that the American people understand that hes doing everything he can to protect them and to keep our institutions and our people safe. And so this is not something that we can rest on our laurels, that we can't understand. He was just down at CENTCOM and SOCOM Monday morning getting a full briefing of the threat that we face from around the world and their motives.And I think that that's something that he weighs very heavily on his mind when he meets with these people, gets these briefings, meets with the Green Beret soldiers, that he recognizes that there are so many people out there putting their life on the line to protect this country and to make sure that we understand the threats, and that its his job and his obligation to do everything within his power to take that information and do what he can to protect the country.And so just to put a pin in it, I just want to be clear. While we may not face an imminent threat today, we don't know when that next threat comes. Is it next week? Is it next month? Is it next year? But the President wants to get ahead of the curve and make sure that we're not talking about what we should have done, but taking every step necessary to make sure that it doesn't happen.Steve.Q  But is the threat today greater than it was yesterday or last week? Because that's what hes saying.MR. SPICER: I understand what hes saying. What Im telling you is, is that we shouldnt ever be behind the curve on the threats this country faces. We should make sure -- we don't know when the next one is coming. We don't know when the next lone wolf is coming. We don't know when the next attack is. We've got amazing intelligence that's trying to root out and make sure that it doesn't happen again. But what we can't do is wait for the next attack to come and say, I wish we had done the following. And the steps that he's taken are proactively making this country and our people safer.Steve.Q  Sean, what was the White House response to the Republican proposal for a carbon tax floated today? And separately, could you just set up tomorrow's meeting with the airline CEOs a little bit? What do you hope to get out of it? What do you hope to discuss?MR. SPICER: So I'm not going to comment on pending legislation. We'll wait to see where that comes. That's just not going to be a habit of ours to comment on every bill that gets introduced or marked up in committee until we have a statement of administration policy. And with respect to the meeting tomorrow, I'll have a further readout on that later tomorrow. But I will say, in general, as you know, he's met with Intel just now. He met with oil executives -- I mean, executives from the car manufacturers, manufacturing companies, technological companies, unions. So these continued meetings that you'll see in the next months and years are going to be an attempt to make sure that he's sitting down with business leaders from around the country to figure out how he can use his office and this administration to further their ability to create jobs and grow the economy.So this is going to be more of a pattern. You're going to continue to see him meeting with people who want to share that agenda to grow, create jobs, manufacture here, lift wages up here, bring benefits to good-paying jobs, et cetera.Q  Should we take any significance from the fact that you did have this meeting about the carbon tax?MR. SPICER: No. I just -- look, we're not at a policy -- we have nothing to announce on that. If I can go now to our next seat -- sorry -- we've got Josh Smith from WJHL in Southwest Virginia.Q  First off, thanks so much for taking questions from journalists covering local news. We appreciate it. WJHL is in Northeast Tennessee and Southwest Virginia -- that is coal country. And I have two questions relating to coal. Then-candidate Trump came to Abingdon, Virginia last year and he made a bold promise -- if it helped to rescue the mining industry, that he would help to bring coal jobs and he would push back against environmental regulations. If the executive order last week was a first step, what specifically is the President willing to do, planning to do to make good on that promise to help the coal industry, to encourage coal production and use, and to deal with what some call its demonized image? And as a follow-up -- and I've got to ask two questions because when am I ever going to get to do this again? What assurances can the President give those who hear him talking about him pushing back against environmental regulations and bringing back coal? What assurances can he give those who are very worried about the impact on the environment?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that there's this -- well, I think when you hear him talk about coal specifically, it's under the guise of clean coal. And I think the technology that we're able to utilize these days make it one of the cleanest uses of technology that we have. And the President's point is that as we bring back this industry, we can do it in a way that is environmentally friendly and it becomes a great and greater energy source for us.Just the other day, the Department of Energy noted that we expect I think it's about a 3 percent increase in coal production in this country, which is a noticeable reverse of where it's been in the past. You mentioned the executive order and the talks that the President has had over the past year or so about his desire to bring back coal. Largely, that has to do with regulation that the EPA has put on existing coal plants that have ensured that they couldn't operate in an effective way to stay open. I think the President is working with industry to roll back a lot of that and do it in a way that's environmental-friendly. And I think that you can do that utilizing the technology you have and harness the power of clean coal, Josh. Thanks.Kristen.Q  Sean, Yemen has withdrawn permission for the United States to run special operations in ground missions against suspected terrorists in the wake of the recent raid there that claimed so many civilian lives. Does that not undercut the administration's ability to fight terrorism in that region? And do you stand by your assessment that it's a success?MR. SPICER: Well, I'll take the last one first. It's absolutely a success. And I think anyone who would suggest it's not a success does disservice to the life of Chief Ryan Owens. He fought knowing what was at stake in that mission. And anybody who would suggest otherwise doesn't fully appreciate how successful that mission was, what the information that they were able to retrieve was, and how that will help prevent future terrorist attacks.Q  But even Senator John McCain --MR. SPICER: I understand that. I think my statement is very clear on that, Kristen. I think anybody who undermines the success of that raid owes an apology and [does] a disservice to the life of Chief Owens.Q  Are you saying that Senator John McCain owes him an apology?MR. SPICER: Hold on, Kristen, can I answer the question? I'm answering the question. Please let me finish. The raid -- the action that was taken in Yemen was a huge success. American lives will be saved because of it. Future attacks will be prevented. The life of Chief Ryan Owens was done in service to this country and we owe him and his family a great debt for the information that we received during that raid. I think any suggestion otherwise is a disservice to his courageous life and the actions that he took. Full stop. I'm sorry, what was the first part?Q  Is that your message to Senator John McCain? He's called it a failure.MR. SPICER: That's my message to anybody who says that. Anybody. I just -- I don't know how much clearer I can be, Kristen.Hunter Walker.Q  Yes, thank you, Sean. This morning, President Trump asked local law enforcement officials to help assist with deportations. If he doesn't get the cooperation he's hoping for, does he plan to have DHS and CBP proactively begin deportations of undocumented criminals in the border zone?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that when you talk about immigration and what he's doing -- whether it's the wall or enforcing existing regulations or visa reform -- I don't think anybody questions the President's commitment to border security and immigration reform. In fact, it's usually quite the opposite. So when it comes to the steps that he's going to take, I think I've addressed this multiple times what his priorities are going to be, but you've seen Secretary Kelly talk about construction of the wall, his implementation of the executive order to keep people out. There is going to be a considerable amount of action on this front -- on immigration and border security. It started day one and it's going to continue through the last possible day until the President feels that this border is 100 percent secure and we've got the immigration system completely under control.Q  Is defunding his only tool to get cooperation from the sanctuary cities?MR. SPICER: Look, I'm not going to get ahead of it. I think when you saw the support and some of the side conversations that the sheriffs and police officers had, and the conversations that we've had beyond that, the sheriffs the other day, the support that they've issued on behalf of his executive actions and his agenda as a whole -- these are the folks on the front lines in many cases, Hunter, that are on the border, that see what some of this does and how it affects families and businesses, not to mention the cost that it is to both our country, in terms of what we have to do to support the immigration at our southern border in particular, but also the cost that it has on our economy and on jobs.So youre going to continue to see a flurry of activity, over and over and over again, to make sure that this President continues to show the importance that he puts on both border security and immigration reform.Q  Thank you, Sean. Yesterday, on CNN, Kellyanne Conway announced that Prime Minister Trudeau is going to be here next week. Can you confirm which day? Have discussions on reviewing the Canadian part of NAFTA started? And can you confirm that Sarah Palin is being considered as ambassador to Ottawa?MR. SPICER: So I will have further updates on the Prime Ministers schedule either later today or tomorrow. Im not in a position where I can finalize that. But we will have --Q  And all the other (inaudible) --MR. SPICER: Guys, slow your roll. (Laughter.) So we will -- with respect to the ambassador, we have no additional ambassador nominations or announcements to make on that front. Im sure, at some point, we will have soon.With respect to the agenda, as the President spoke with Prime Minister Trudeau a few weeks ago, they talked about trade and security and commerce, and I think all of that is going to be discussed at the time when the President and him further meet or discuss this.Q  And I wanted to follow up on that if you dont mind. Just on NATO, Canada, of course, is one of the 28 member countries. The President has been calling out countries that pay their fair share of dues. What are his options if countries dont listen to him? And what does this really mean?MR. SPICER: Well, I think -- look, every country is obligated to pay two percent of their GDP, and the President has made it very clear that, for too long, many countries have been getting a free ride. When he has talked to these countries, and as Ive just read out, both Erdogan and Rajoy -- he has addressed this not just with them, but to so many of the other NATO countries. And, by and large, every single one of them agrees with that. They understand the importance of NATO, and the President is very clear that in order for NATO to be successful, these folks have to pay their fair share.Carol Lee. Q  I want to follow on Kristen, and then I just have a question on Turkey. Does the White House have a reaction to reports that Yemen has revoked permission for the U.S. to do ground missions there?MR. SPICER: Yemen, more than most countries, fully appreciates the fight that we have with ISIS, and I think were going to continue to work with them to strengthen our diplomatic relationships and understand our fight against terrorism. And so at this point, Ill leave it at as that we understand that we share that commitment with them, and were going to continue to work with them to combat ISIS and to make sure that we do that. Im not in a position to go any further at this time.Q  President Erdogan said today that the U.S. agreed to work with Turkey to take Raqqa. Can you clarify what the President said to him in that phone call?MR. SPICER: I cant. I think the readout was as specific as we want to get with his conversation.Q  What's his characterization of the conversation?MR. SPICER: I think the readout that we put out on Turkey was as far as we want to go with that. Thank you.Hold on, Im going to go to our last one, Adriana Cohen, a radio host and columnist for the Boston Herald.Q  Great to be with you, Sean. Last night, Boston Mayor Walsh went on a television show to talk about sanctuary cities. What does the President make of his vow to house illegal immigrants in Boston City Hall to shield them from the Trump administration?MR. SPICER: I think the Presidents executive order is pretty clear when it comes to these kind of actions. Again, I referenced it earlier in the briefing, but its twofold. One is, theres a concern about the safety of the American people and how we let people come into this country, and second, with respect to the American taxpayer. And if were going to be sending federal tax dollars to folks to Washington, I think they need to be used appropriately. And the President is going to do everything in his power to respect the money that taxpayers send to Washington and is spent facilitating legal activities and on American citizens. Blake.Q  Thanks, Sean. Earlier today, the President said that the wall is in the process of being designed. Given his previous background, is he or does he plan on being actively involved with the designing and the implementation of that wall? And separately, last night, Elizabeth Warren -- any reaction from the White House on whether you believe what Mitch McConnell did was the correct thing? Critics say she was silenced on the Senate floor.MR. SPICER: On the wall, I mean, the President is a builder. He understands and I think hes going to make sure that as this project moves forward, that hes going to stay in close touch with Secretary Kelly to make sure that it fits his specs. But he takes enormous attention to detail, and he wants to make sure it gets done right. So I would expect that a project of this magnitude and one that is this high on his priority list will get the necessary attention from the President.Q  And Senator Warren?MR. SPICER: Im sorry?Q  Senator Warren last night?MR. SPICER: Yeah, look, I would refer you back to Senate rules. I mean, this is not something that we tend to discuss here. Ill leave it to Senator McConnell and the Senate to discuss Senate rules.Q  I just wanted to follow up again on Yemen. Just not sure exactly what youre trying to say here. I seems like the report was that the Yemeni government has asked the U.S. to stop doing any ground operations with regard to AQAP. Is that the request that you got from the Yemeni government?MR. SPICER: We'll have further information on that going forward. I think we are in touch with Yemeni officials. Were working this through diplomatic channels. But they understand the fight and the commitment that we both share when it comes to rooting out ISIS. And Ill have more information on that going forward.Q  So can I ask on the Presidents tweet, Hallie had mentioned on part of it. The other part of it this morning was that theres been a big increase in traffic to the U.S. from certain areas. Can you say what certain areas hes referring to, and what data is he leaning on?MR. SPICER: Ill get back to you on that. Ive got to pull the data field on that.Margaret.Q  Sean, two questions. Turkey -- did the President dispatch the CIA director to Turkey as Turkish reports are saying right now?MR. SPICER: I just saw the CIA director, so if it happened, it hasnt happened in the last hour.Q  Okay. The rest of that question was about -- this is part one -- about Glen, whether there was discussion of extraditing Fetullah Glen who Turkey views as a terrorist.MR. SPICER: I have nothing further than the readout at this time.Q  The second question, though, was about your statement -- ""We dont know when the next lone wolf is coming."" I believe, based on numbers, that the vast majority of lone-wolf attacks have been carried out by people who are either American, American-born, or naturalized American citizens. So what specifically are you referring to there? And what is he doing about those who are radicalized in front of their own computer screens?MR. SPICER: Well, I guess my question, Margaret -- I mean, I think theres at least -- just for example, within the seven countries that weve talked about, theres at least 20-some odd people that, over the last few years, have come into this country and been convicted of or charged with acts of terrorism. So the --Q  But the people who are lone wolves and radicalized here.MR. SPICER: I understand that. But what Im getting at is, you dont know, I dont know when is the next act, whos going to commit it, how are they going to commit it. The point is, is that you dont look at odds and say, hey, lets play the odds on American lives. You do exactly what you can to present any attack from occurring. And so I think you can go through any system and say, when was the last time that somebody committed a shoe bomb, and so let's not take shoes off. The TSA --Q  That's not what I'm asking.MR. SPICER: No, I get what you're asking. You're asking, when is the next terrorist attack, and we dont know.Q  No, what is being done about people who are radicalized in the basement, in front of the computer screen, who are not affected by this ban.MR. SPICER: Right. And I think the President has asked both for a plan to defeat ISIS from stuff that is coming in from this, and he's taking steps but he's also looking at working with the FBI and domestic intelligence agencies to gather the best information we can to prevent acts on our soil from people, wherever they may be.Q  So something more is being done on that front that we havent heard about?MR. SPICER: He has tasked the FBI. It is a whole-of-government approach to what's going on. We're not looking at this myopically and just saying, these are the seven countries. The whole point of that first executive ban* [order], and I know that's not entirely what you're asking, was to start with countries that didnt have the appropriate vetting measures to ensure that they could come into this country.As we move forward through this 90-day period, we're reviewing other countries, other options. Those are the external threats coming into this country. At the same time, the President has looked at options within the domestic intelligence gathering to figure out whether it's cyber or other ways that we can determine other ways to prevent or get ahead of additional threats that we might face in this country. But it's not an either/or proposition. It's a whole-of-government approach to what's going on.Q  A bipartisan group of senators are introducing legislation -- and I know you dont like to talk about legislation -- that would allow the Senate to sign off on a reduction in sanctions against Russia. Would the President support such a check by Congress on sanctions?MR. SPICER: Well, there's two sets of sanctions, Tamara, that we got to deal with, right? One is the ones with respect to Crimea. And I think that Ambassador Haley has addressed that very forcefully at the U.N., that until Russia leaves Crimea, that those sanctions are a non-starter. With respect to the other ones, I dont want to get ahead of the legislation, if that's what that specifically is dealing with. But again, we're not going to get into pending legislation.With respect to the sanctions that specifically deal with Ukraine and Crimea, I think that Ambassador Haley has spoken very, very clearly about that. Q  Sean, thanks. The President said this morning in his address to the law enforcement officials, that he'll have a zero-tolerance policy for attacks against law enforcement officers. As a specific policy proposal, what does that mean exactly? More death penalty cases on the federal level? What does he mean?MR. SPICER: I think that what the President said not just yesterday with his meeting with the sheriffs, but then today, is that he wants them to understand that he is a true friend -- they have a true friend in the White House, somebody who understands the dangers that they face every day by putting their lives on the line to protect the American people, whether it's pulling someone up for a traffic stop and not knowing what's in the car, or going up to a house to serve a warrant and not knowing who's behind that door. These men and women, every day, day in and day out, are willing to put their lives on the line and make huge sacrifices. So he wants them to know that they have a true friend here in the White House that's going to have their back. How that manifests itself going forward, I think the President will have further details as that moves forward. But for right now, I think his number-one message to them was: You've got a friend, he's got your back, let's do what we can to get these cities. I think the other thing that was important is that, you know, he mentioned Chicago. Their crime rate -- their murder rate is up 45, 50 percent. And in so many of these cities it's up. It's unacceptable. And I think the President is disgusted that so many American lives are taken, injured, whatever -- that we can't walk down the streets of our own cities in safety. And I think he wants to make sure that they understand his commitment not just to preventing acts of terrorism from coming into this country, but also that whether it's gang violence or whatever, that people feel safe and that law enforcement is empowered to do what it can to keep our community safe, to work with communities, to establish policies that both respect our citizens but do so in a way that makes them feel safe and allows them to drive and walk down the streets of our city.Charlie.Q  Journalist Matt Drudge tweeted today that the Republican Party should be sued for fraud, basically upset about the lack of any legislation to repeal Obamacare or any tax cut legislation. So what's your message to him and anyone else who's worried about sort of the big push in the beginning and who might be concerned that that momentum is stalling?MR. SPICER: I think it's hardly stalling. I think it's a mammoth thing to repeal and replace. I think there's no question the President's commitment to doing this. You've heard Speaker Ryan talk about how we should be able to have this wrapped up by the end of the year. It's a big bill. It got jammed through, and it was very sweeping. We're talking about one-fifth of our economy. We can either do it quickly, as the Democrats did, and end up with a monstrosity where premiums go up, access is limited, or we can do it right. And I think the President, while he wants to get this done as soon as possible and understand what's at stake, he wants to do it right. He understands how important health care is to American families and individuals. And so his goal is to get it done right and have an outcome that achieves the goals that it sets out to do. That's it -- plain and simple.April.Q  Sean, I have a series of questions. MR. SPICER: Look what you started, Hallie Jackson. (Laughter.) Q  Don't blame it on Hallie, okay?  Going back to the issue of policing, what happens when there is a situation -- you're talking about good policing -- but what happens when there are situations that we've seen over the last few years that have been highlighted with this accountability piece with cameras? What happens when there is bad policing? What does this President --MR. SPICER: Then we have to deal with it. I don't -- I think the President wants to do what he can. But again, I think you're right, we've got to have good policing. But that's -- he wants to stand with them, talk about how we can do proper training, what kind of funding they need to do their job better. In so many cases, the policy are asking for the resources because they've become fearful of making routine stops by preventing it. So I think its working with the police, integrating those kind of back and forth and having a dialogue in communities to make sure that we're doing it, as you put it, in a way that instills confidence in our citizens and our communities. But we can do this right. And we can make sure --Q  So its not an either/or, though?MR. SPICER: No, absolutely no.Q  Okay.MR. SPICER: No, no, no. We've got to do this -- look, police officers from around this country on a daily basis put their lives out there, and I think that they want to keep communities safe. Like teachers, they enter this not -- no cop signs up, or sheriff, because of the money. Like teachers, they do it because they care about the community. They care about making this country better, their community better. But I think, in return, they should be provided the resources and the policies they need to do their job well and to do so that ensures that we have this back-and-forth dialogue with the American people that continues to earn the respect that they deserve for the sacrifice they're making.Q  All right, the next question. MR. SPICER: How many have we got? Just so I --Q  Maybe three -- maybe three more. (Laughter.) Its Black History Month. Let me go. (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: You can play that once. (Laughter.) Q  I got a couple more days. MR. SPICER: Okay. (Laughter.)Q  All right, so listen, on the issue of last evening with Elizabeth Warren. Coretta Scott King -- I want to get your reaction to these words that they're not allowed: Mr. Sessions has used the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to serve as a federal judge. And shes basically saying that Sessions has indifference towards criminal violations of civil rights laws. What do you say to that?MR. SPICER: Well, obviously, we have a lot of respect for her and the sacrifices that she made, and the sacrifices that, frankly, she endured in her life. But I would respectfully disagree with her assessment of Senator Session then and now.His records on civil voting rights I think is outstanding. And like Arlen Specter, the late Arlen Specter, I can only hope that if she was still with us today, that after getting to know him and to see his record and his commitment to voting civil rights, that she would share the same view that Senator Specter did where he said, Although I voted against him, getting to know the man that is now, I regret that vote. And I would hope that if she was still with us today that she would share that sentiment. Because Senator Sessionss records both as U.S. attorney for Alabama, as attorney general, and as senator has been one that has stood up for voting rights. He prosecuted the Klan. He stood up for Coretta Scott King getting -- for getting the gold medal. He has been a tireless advocate of voting and civil rights throughout his career. And I would just hope that if she was still with us today, that she would share the sentiments of former Senator Specter.Q  Okay, and last two. On diversity here, the administrations diversity issues, you've been slammed on that recently. I understand that theres been a meeting. Vice President Pence has been talking to J.C. Watts, Michael Steele and others -- if you can elaborate on that. And also theres a lot of groundswell about this HBCU executive order. Whats going on with that?MR. SPICER: So the HBCU presidents will be in town later this month as part of a national celebration. Well have further updates on both the meetings that we may have with them, the activities surrounding that, in terms of the administration. And then I think well have further updates on it, as I mentioned with all executive orders. We have nothing to update on that.But obviously, the President has a strong commitment to them and understands over the last eight years they've been woefully neglected. And I think he wants to really show a commitment in funding to HBCUs. And so youll see I think not just a push this month, but in his budget and going forward.Q  PLUS loans, Pell grants?MR. SPICER: I think his budget will address a lot of these issues, April.Q  The diversity piece, the diversity piece.MR. SPICER: And I think -- look, we're going to continue to reach out to a lot of folks to get their ideas and their input. I think hes shown that both through the transition and now. But we're going to continue to reach out to people of different backgrounds, of different color, of different gender, of different economic -- socioeconomic, of different industry, of different parties. The President I think continues to show a desire to reach out and talk to people who I think share an agenda of moving the country forward and doesn't really care about their background, their voting history, any of those other ideological traits. If they share a commitment to moving this country forward and lifting people up, that's his end of --Q  Sean --Q  You mentioned the ""one in, two out"" order in your opening. There was a lawsuit filed in federal court this morning challenging that lawsuit. Is the White House aware of that?MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  And whats your response to it?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the lawsuit presumes a lot of outcomes that are widely inaccurate. I think that it presumes that certain things would be part of the ""one out.""The bottom line is, is that overregulation has stemmed economic growth and job creation. Reviewing those to make sure that they are meeting their intent and not stifling job creation at the expense of whatever they were intended to do is something that should be smart and welcome by everybody. The idea that we're willy-nilly just allowing regulations to occur, but the lawsuit specifically, is wildly inaccurate. It makes a ton of assumptions that call for speculation on what may or may not happen in the future. And that's highly -- it's just subjective at best and doesn't have any basis in fact.Thank you, guys. Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.Q  More hands up here, Sean.MR. SPICER: I know, I'll see them tomorrow.END2:38 P.M. EST",20054.34,-35.95000000000073,5682.45,8.229999999999563,2294.67,1.5900000000001455

106,2017-02-08,Remarks by President Trump at MCCA Winter Conference,"J.W. MarriottWashington, D.C.9:18 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. This is -- great to be with people I truly feel comfortable with. Please sit down. Theyll say I didnt get a standing ovation because they never sat down. (Laughter.) And I say, I got one standing ovation because they never sat down. But I want to thank you. I have great, great love for what you do and the way you do it. And when Im with the police chiefs and Im with the sheriffs of our country -- and these are the big ones. These are the really big ones. I just want to thank you very much. And I thought before I spoke about what were really here to speak about, I would read something to you. Because you can be a lawyer, or you dont have to be a lawyer; if you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this. And its really incredible to me that we have a court case thats going on so long. As you know, in Boston, we won it with a highly respected judge and a very strong opinion, but now were in an era that, lets just say, they are interpreting things differently than probably 100 percent of the people in this room. Id like to almost know, does anybody disagree when I read this.But Im going to read whats in dispute, whats in question. And you will see this -- its INA 212(f) 8 U.S.C. 1182(f): Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President -- okay, now, this isnt just me, this is for Obama, for Ronald Reagan, for the President. And this was done, very importantly, for security -- something you people know more about than all of us. It was done for the security of our nation, the security of our citizens, so that people come in who arent going to do us harm.And thats why it was done. And it couldnt have been written any more precisely. Its not like, oh, gee, we wish it were written better. It was written beautifully. So just listen, heres what it says. This is what theyre arguing: ""Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens"" -- okay, the entry, the entry of any aliens -- ""or of any class of aliens"" -- so any aliens, any class of aliens -- ""into the United States"" -- so the entry of people into the United States. Lets say, just to be precise, of aliens into the United States. So any time -- ""whenever the President finds that the entry of any alien or any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States"" -- right? So if I find, as President, that a person or group of people will be detrimental to the interests of the United States -- and certainly theres lots of examples that we have, but you shouldnt even have them, necessarily -- he may be -- and ""he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary"" Now, the only mistake is they should have said ""he or she."" But hopefully, it wont be a she for at least another seven years. After that, Im all -- (laughter and applause.) See? I just noticed that, actually. I just noticed it. Im saying, whoa, this is not politically correct. Its correct, but its not politically correct, you know, this is the old days.He may by proclamation and for such period as he shall deem necessary -- so here it is, people coming in -- suspend the entry of all aliens. Right? Thats what it says. Its not like -- again, a bad high school student would understand this. Anybody would understand this. Suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens. Okay, so you can suspend the aliens, right? You can suspend the aliens from coming in -- very strong -- or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.Okay. So you can suspend, you can put restrictions, you can do whatever you want. And this is for the security of the country -- which, again, youre the chiefs, youre the sheriffs. You understand this. And I listened to lawyers on both sides last night, and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it. I listened to a panel of judges, and Ill comment on that -- I will not comment on the statements made by certainly one judge. But I have to be honest that if these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court in terms of respect for the court, they'd what they should be doing. I mean, its so sad. They should be -- when you read something so simple and so beautifully written, and so perfectly written -- other than the one statement, of course, having to do with he or she -- but when you read something so perfectly written and so clear to anybody, and then you have lawyers and you watched -- I watched last night in amazement, and I heard things that I couldnt believe, things that really had nothing to do with what I just read. And I dont ever want to call a court biased, so I wont call it biased. And we havent had a decision yet. But courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do whats right. And that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important.Right now, we are at risk because of what happened. General Kelly is an extremely talented man and a very good man -- now Secretary Kelly, Homeland Security. We are doing our job. Hes a great man. (Applause.) Were doing our job. And one of the reasons you probably heard that we did it so quickly -- in fact, I said, lets give a one-month notice, and then law enforcement -- and General Kelly was so great because he said, we totally knew about it. We knew about everything. We do things well. We did things right.But the law enforcement people said to me, oh, you cant give a notice, because if you give a notice that youre going to be really tough in one month from now, or in one week from now -- I suggested a month and I said, well, what about a week? They said, no, you cant do that, because then people are going to pour in before the toughness goes on. Do you people agree? I mean, you know more about law than anybody, law enforcement. (Applause.) So I wanted to give, like, a month. Then I said, well, what about a week? They said, well, then youre going to have a whole pile of people perhaps -- perhaps -- with very evil intentions coming in before the restrictions.So there it is, folks. Its as plain as you can have it. I didnt -- and I was a good student. I understand things. I comprehend very well, okay? Better than I think almost anybody. And I want to tell you, I listened to a bunch of stuff last night on television that was disgraceful. It was disgraceful. Because what I just read to you is what we have, and it just cant be written any plainer or better. And for us to be going through this -- and, by the way, a highly, highly respected judge in Boston ruled very strongly in our favor. You heard that.In fact, I said to my people, why dont you use the Boston case? And there were reasons why they couldnt use the Boston case. This one came later for various reasons. But use the Boston case. And I wont read that, but there were statements made by that judge -- who, again, highly respected -- that were right on. They were perfect. They were perfect.So I think its sad. I think its a sad day. I think our security is at risk today. And it will be at risk until such time as we are entitled and get what we are entitled to as citizens of this country. As chiefs, as sheriffs of this country, we want security. One of the reasons I was elected was because of law and order and security. Its one of the reasons I was elected. Also jobs and lots of other things. But I think one of the strongest reasons is security. And theyre taking away our weapons one by one, thats what theyre doing. And you know it and I know it, and you people have been very unhappy for a long period of time. And I can read the polls maybe better than anybody because it seems that I understood the polls a lot better than many of the pollsters understood the polls -- assuming they were honest polls, which I think probably many of them werent. I really believe that. (Applause.)But we need security in our country. We have to allow you folks to do your job. Youre great people, great people. Great men and women. And we have to allow you to do your job. And we have to give you the weapons that you need. And this is a weapon that you need. And theyre trying to take it away from you, maybe because of politics or maybe because of political views. We cant let that happen.So with that, lets get on to business, right? Its really something. Thank you. (Applause.) I want to thank Sheriff Sandra Hutchens and Chief Tom Manger for your leadership and, frankly, for the service. You have had great service. Everyone has told me about you two legendary people. All of us here today are united by one shared mission: to serve and protect the public of the United States.During my campaign for President, I had the chance to spend time with law enforcement officials all across our country. They are the most incredible people you will ever meet. And I just wanted to say to all of them right now, from the bottom of my heart, thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause.) There are many actions we in the federal government can take to help improve safety in your communities. But I believe that community safety begins with moral leadership. Our police officers, sheriffs and deputies risk their lives every day. And theyre entitled to an administration that has their back. (Applause.) The first step in restoring public safety is affirming our confidence in the men and women charged with upholding our laws. And Im going to add justices, judges in that category. And Im very proud to have picked Judge Gorsuch, who I think is going to be an outstanding member of the Supreme Court -- outstanding. (Applause.) So Id like to begin my remarks with a declaration issued to all of you, and delivered to every member of the law enforcement community all across the United States. My message today is that you have a true, true friend in the White House. You have. (Applause.) I stand with you. I support our police. I support our sheriffs. And we support the men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.) Right now, many communities in America are facing a public safety crisis. Murders in 2015 experienced their largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. In 2016, murders in large cities continued to climb by double digits. In many of our biggest cities, 2016 brought an increase in the number of homicides, rapes, assaults and shootings. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the rate so far this year has been even higher. What is going on in Chicago? We cannot allow this to continue. Weve allowed too many young lives to be claimed -- and you see that, you see that all over -- claimed by gangs, and too many neighborhoods to be crippled by violence and fear. Sixty percent of murder victims under the age of 22 are African American. This is a national tragedy, and it requires national action. This violence must end, and we must all work together to end it.Whether a child lives in Detroit, Chicago, Baltimore, or anywhere in our country, he or she has the right to grow up in safety and in peace. No one in America should be punished because of the city where he or she is born. Every child in America should be able to play outside without fear, walk home without danger, and attend a school without being worried about drugs or gangs or violence.So many lives and so many people have been cut short. Their potential, their life has been cut short. So much potential has been sidelined. And so many dreams have been shattered and broken, totally broken. Its time to stop the drugs from pouring into our country. And, by the way, we will do that. And I will say this: General, now Secretary, Kelly will be the man to do it, and we will give him a wall. And it will be a real wall. (Applause.) And a lot of things will happen very positively for your cities, your states, believe me. The wall is getting designed right now. A lot of people say, oh, oh, Trump was only kidding with the wall. I wasnt kidding. I dont kid. I dont kid. I watch this, and they say I was kidding. No, I dont kid. I dont kid about things like that, I can tell you. No, we will have a wall. It will be a great wall, and it will do a lot of -- will be a big help. Just ask Israel about walls. Do walls work? Just ask Israel. They work -- if its properly done. Its time to dismantle the gangs terrorizing our citizens, and its time to ensure that every young American can be raised in an environment of decency, dignity, love and support. You have asked for the resources, tools and support you need to get the job done. We will do whatever we can to help you meet those demands. That includes a zero tolerance policy for acts of violence against law enforcement. (Applause.) We all see what happens. We all see what happens and whats been happening to you. Its not fair. We must protect those who protect us. The number of officers shot and killed in the line of duty last year increased by 56 percent from the year before. Last year, in Dallas, police officers were targeted for execution - think of this. Who ever heard of this? They were targeted for execution. Twelve were shot and five were killed. These heroic officers died as they lived - protecting the innocent, rushing into danger, risking their lives for people they did not even know, but for people that they were determined to save. Hats off to you people.These slain officers are an eternal monument to all of the men and women who protect our streets and serve our public. We will not forget them, and we will not forget all of the others who made that final sacrifice in the line of duty.God has blessed our nation to put these heroes among us. Those who serve in law enforcement work long hours. You work long hours. I know so many sheriffs, so many chiefs, so many police who work long hours and dangerous hours, oftentimes in difficult conditions and for not that much pay relative to what youre doing. They do it because they care. We must work with them, not against them. Theyre working against you. For many years theyve been working against you. We must support them, not undermine them. And instead of division and disunity -- and which is so much disunity -- we must build bridges of partnership and of trust. Those who demonize law enforcement or who use the actions of a few to discredit the service of many are hurting the very people they say that they want to help. When policing is reduced, crime is increased, and our poorest citizens suffer the most. And I see it all the time. When the number of police goes down, crime goes up.To build needed trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, it is not enough for us to merely talk to each other. We must listen to each other. All of us share the view that those in uniform must be held to the highest possible standard of conduct -- so important. You're the role models to young Americans all across this country, many of whom want to go into law enforcement, many of whom want to be a sheriff or a police chief, many of whom -- they have great respect for you. Tremendous respect. You don't even realize it, but I will tell you, they have great respect and admiration for the people in this room and the people that you represent. And don't let anyone ever tell you different. Don't let the dishonest media try and convince you that it's different than that, because it's not. (Applause.)That is why our commitment to law and law enforcement also includes ensuring that we are giving departments the resources they need to train, recruit and retain talent. As part of our commitment to safe communities, we will also work to address the mental health crisis. Prisons should not be a substitute for treatment. We will fight to increase access to life-saving treatment to battle the addiction to drugs, which is afflicting our nation like never ever before -- ever. (Applause.)I've been here two weeks. I've met a lot of law enforcement officials. Yesterday, I brought them into the Oval Office. I asked a group, what impact do drugs have in terms of a percentage on crime? They said, 75 to 80 percent. That's pretty sad. We're going to stop the drugs from pouring in. We're going to stop those drugs from poisoning our youth, from poisoning our people. We're going to be ruthless in that fight. We have no choice. (Applause.)And we're going to take that fight to the drug cartels and work to liberate our communities from their terrible grip of violence. You have the power and knowledge to tell General Kelly -- now Secretary Kelly -- who the illegal immigrant gang members are. Now, you have that power because you know them, you're there, you're local. You know the illegals, you know them by their first name, you know them by their nicknames. You have that power. The federal government can never be that precise. But you're in the neighborhoods -- you know the bad ones, you know the good ones. I want you to turn in the bad ones. Call Secretary Kelly's representatives and we'll get them out of our country and bring them back where they came from, and we'll do it fast. You have to call up the federal government, Homeland Security, because so much of the problems -- you look at Chicago and you look at other places. So many of the problems are caused by gang members, many of whom are not even legally in our country.And we will work with you on the frontlines to keep America safe from terrorism, which is what I began this with. Terrorism -- a tremendous threat, far greater than people in our country understand. Believe me. I've learned a lot in the last two weeks. And terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand. But we're going to take care of it. We're going to win. We're going to take care of it, folks.Let today be the beginning of a great national partnership. Let today serve as a great call to action. And let this moment represent a new beginning in relations between law enforcement and our communities. I want you to know the American public totally stands with you. I want you to know the American people support you. I want you to know how proud we are, truly proud, to know you. We applaud your efforts. We thank you for your service. And we promise that you will always find an open door at the White House -- an open invitation to our great cops and sheriffs nationwide. They're great people. You are great people.Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)END9:44 A.M. EST",20054.34,-35.95000000000073,5682.45,8.229999999999563,2294.67,1.5900000000001455
107,2017-02-08,Judge Neil Gorsuch is the Mainstream Choice for the Supreme Court,"Gorsuch in the MainstreamHe was upheld at the Supreme Court in seven of eight cases.The Wall Street JournalOne political trope of modern judicial politics is to declare a conservative nominee out of the mainstream. The line is never applied to progressive nominees because to the media the mainstream is by definition progressive. Expect to hear more of this about Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, albeit without evidence to back it up.According to an analysis by Jeff Harris at Kirkland & Ellis, Judge Gorsuch has written some 800 opinions since joining the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2006. Only 1.75% (14 opinions) drew dissents from his colleagues. That makes 98% of his opinions unanimous even on a circuit where seven of the 12 active judges were appointed by Democratic Presidents and five by Republicans. Add the senior judges, who hear fewer cases, and the circuit has 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats.Judge Gorsuch is known on the Tenth Circuit as a strong writer and consensus builder, and the pattern extends to his participation in opinions by other judges. Judge Gorsuch has heard roughly 2,700 cases and dissented in only 351.3%.Not many of his cases have ended up at the Supreme Court, but when they have his analysis has been routinely upheld by the Justices. Of at least eight cases considered by Mr. Gorsuch that were appealed to the Supreme Court, the Justices upheld his result in seven. In four of those the decisions were unanimous.Read the fullarticle from The Wall Street Journal here.",20054.34,-35.95000000000073,5682.45,8.229999999999563,2294.67,1.5900000000001455

109,2017-02-08,Widespread Support for Judge Neil Gorsuch,"All across the country editorial boards are praising Judge Gorsuch as a well qualified nominee for the Supreme Court.But the other reality is that Judge Gorsuch is overwhelmingly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.(Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 2/5/17)There Is No Question Gorsuch Is Qualified. (Albuquerque Journal, 2/5/17)The Judge He Chose, Neil Gorsuch Of The Federal Appeals Court For The 10th Circuit, Carries Impeccable Credentials.(Akron Beacon Journal, 2/3/17)The qualifications for service on the Supreme Court emphasize temperament more than ideology. Indeed, a proper temperament has philosophical implications. Neil Gorsuch has the right stuff.(Richmond Times-Dispatch, 2/4/17)Across the board, those who know him have spoken up in favor of his temperament, knowledge of the law and commitment to judicial independence.(Miami Herald, 2/2/17)At the very least, Gorsuch is exceedingly qualified. His resume is long and distinguished. His writing is clear and thoughtful. The resume alone should propel Gorsuch's name to the floor for a full vote.(Quad-City Times, 2/3/17)Judge Gorsuch is a leading light on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, where he was appointed in 2006 by George W. Bush.  As qualified as he is, Judge Gorsuch ought to be confirmed at least as easily as President Obamas appointees Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor.(The Wall Street Journal, 1/31/17)No one has ever questioned Gorsuchs intellect or qualifications. A graduate of Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, he clerked for two Supreme Court justices and served in the Department of Justice and at a top law firm before beginning a 10-year appeals court stint.  While Gorsuch is hardly our ideological ideal, he is a high-caliber mind who stands solidly in the mainstream of conservative jurisprudence. Barring unforeseen revelations  or a partisan blockade that would be as hypocritical as it is destructive  his journey from Judge Gorsuch to Justice Gorsuch is easy to envision.(New York Daily News, 1/31/17)As President Trump announced his choice of Judge Neil Gorsuch to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia on Tuesday, one big question hovered over Washington: Were Senate Democrats prepared to block the U.S. Supreme Court nomination by any means?  His scholarly credentials are impeccable: Columbia, Harvard, Oxford and Supreme Court clerk for Justices Byron Whizzer White and Anthony Kennedy.(San Francisco Chronicle, 1/31/17)Gorsuch boasts an impeccable rsum, having clerked for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. Affable and witty, hes even described as Scalias intellectual equal.(New York Post, 1/31/17)Gorsuch is an impressive jurist, and that judgment goes beyond his Harvard law background, his clerking for two U.S. Supreme Court justices and the acclaim hes received as a judge and professor.  For these reasons, we believe that if Gorsuch does well in his nomination hearings and if no red flags emerge in the heavy scrutiny he is likely to face in coming weeks, he deserves confirmation.(San Diego Union-Tribune, 1/31/17)Gorsuch, who sits on the federal appeals court in the Denver-based 10th circuit, has been praised for his elegant writing.  His pedigree is undeniably impressive: Gorsuch clerked on the Supreme Court for Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy and studied for a doctorate of philosophy at Oxford University.(Houston Chronicle, 1/31/17)Trump Could Not Have Made A Better Supreme Court Appointment Than Gorsuch.(Colorado Springs Gazette, 1/31/17)Neil Gorsuch is a federal judge in Denver with Western roots and a reputation for being a brilliant legal mind and talented writer. Those who have followed Gorsuchs career say that from his bench in the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals he has applied the law fairly and consistently, even issuing provocative challenges to the Supreme Court to consider his rulings.(Denver Post, 1/26/17)In perhaps his most responsible decision since taking office, President Donald Trump has nominated a well-qualified, conservative federal appeals court judge to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Neil Gorsuch is widely praised for his sharp intellect, low-key demeanor and clear writing.  Gorsuch is a well-qualified conservative who would not tilt the Supreme Court's ideological balance, and he deserves full consideration and a confirmation vote by the Senate.(Tampa Bay Times, 2/1/17)But trashing Mr. Gorsuch as an outlandish radical, despite his impeccable credentials, the wide respect he commands in his field, his long service as an appeals court judge and the unanimous voice vote he received the last time the Senate considered him for the federal bench, is at the very least premature.(The Washington Post, 2/1/17)Neil Gorsuch is highly principled and deeply experienced, and is poised to become the intellectual leader of conservative jurisprudence.  Gorsuch is a masterful pick. His resume and background are beyond challenge: Harvard-, Columbia- and Oxford-educated; clerked for two Supreme Court justices; praised for his temperament and reverence for the law; more than a decade of experience on the federal bench. He is a legal superstar and Democrats know it.(Detroit News, 2/1/17)Colorado Judge Neil Gorsuch is an excellent choice to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, and fulfills President Donald Trumps campaign promise to pick a worthy successor to Justice Antonin Scalia.  Neil Gorsuch would be a stellar addition to the court, and we endorse his confirmation.(New Hampshire Union Leader, 2/2/17)[Gorsuch] is a traditional pick, lauded by liberals and conservatives alike as a brilliant legal mind in the mold of Scalia (only the conservatives like that last part, of course). He boasts a flawless resume. He is praised for his temperament and clear writing. He deserves fair consideration and speedy confirmation.(Boston Herald, 2/2/17)Gorsuch is plainly an able and thoughtful jurist, a skilled and incisive legal writer.  Above all, Gorsuch is simply, undeniably, a legitimate and respectable nominee.(Minneapolis Star-Tribune, 2/1/17)Gorsuch has a stellar resume, and at least he will get the courtesy of a Senate hearing to explain his theory of original intent when interpreting the Constitution.(Newsday, 2/1/17)In nominating Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court, President Trump selected exactly the sort of person his supporters were hoping for when they cast their ballots in November  a solid conservative with great legal credentials and a profound respect for the Constitution. Gorsuch's confirmation should be a slam dunk, but of course he will have to survive a ferocious opposition campaign by Democrats and progressive groups.(The Oklahoman, 2/2/17)From the evidence so far, Neil Gorsuch has the qualities anyone considered for justice of the highest court should have: a strong understanding and respect for the nations founding document, the U.S. Constitution.  Congratulations to President Trump on a quality pick for Supreme Court justice(Charleston Daily Mail, 2/1/17)His integrity is absolute; his disposition appropriate for the job.  Our initial reaction to Gorsuch's nomination was to cheer.  The Times-Dispatch believes Neil Gorsuch would be a valuable addition to a Supreme Court whose motto proclaims Equal justice under law.(Richmond Times-Dispatch, 2/1/17)From what's been reported, Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, appears to be highly qualified and deserving of an up-or-down vote after intensive vetting.  Gorsuch certainly has excellent qualifications and appears to be a distinguished choice.(South Florida Sun Sentinel, 2/1/17)Judge Neil Gorsuch, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (based in Denver and serving six Western states from Kansas to New Mexico), is a stellar choice for the Supreme Court.(Toledo Blade, 2/2/17)By any reasonable legal standard, Gorsuchs work history makes him eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.  Just like Obama nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagen before him, Gorsuchs legal qualifications are excellent.(East Bay Times, 2/1/17)So it was with at least a modicum of relief that we learned the man the new president has nominated to succeed the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is not a renegade neophyte contemptuous of those who have come before him, but a seasoned appellate judge respected by peers across the ideological spectrum.  But Gorsuch's sterling resume does little to reassure liberals who see him as a more youthful, less acerbic, but equally determined champion for the originalist judicial outlook that Scalia personified.(Detroit Free Press, 2/1/17)Based on [Gorsuchs] resume  Columbia undergrad, Harvard Law School, Oxford as a Marshall Scholar, two Supreme Court clerkships and experience handling a variety of cases on a federal appellate court  qualifications shouldn't be an issue. On the temperament front, he has a strong reputation as a collegial and modest jurist who works well with those across the ideological spectrum.(Baltimore Sun, 2/1/17)Amid the insane swirl of action and immediate reaction of his first 12 days, Donald Trump has made a well-considered selection for the next justice of the Supreme Court.  Judge Gorsuch is more than qualified in education, experience, judicial record and temperament.(Worcester Telegram, 2/2/17)Gorsuch Has Strong Qualifications.(Tulsa World, 2/2/17)Gorsuch is widely respected in legal circles, across the political spectrum, as a serious scholar committed to the rule of law.(Chicago Sun-Times, 2/1/17)Gorsuchs Legal Pedigree Is Impressive.(Bergen Record, 2/1/17)",20054.34,-35.95000000000073,5682.45,8.229999999999563,2294.67,1.5900000000001455

ESTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, General Caslen. Your wife informed me that it was not booing that I heard when you came up, but it was Supe. (Laughter.) Give this wonderful superintendent a round of applause, would you please? He deserves it, and the nation is proud of your service. (Applause.)General Holland, General Jebb, Captain Villanueva, distinguished guests, and core of cadets of the United States Military Academy -- it is an extraordinary privilege for me to be with you tonight.Two special guests are with me that I want to acknowledge. A man who I knew before he was even elected to the Congress, and now he is one of the most prominent members of the United States Senate; Senator Tim Scott is with us tonight just to be with all of you. Senator Scott, thank you for joining us this evening. (Applause.)And my commanding officer is with us, as well. My wife of 31 years -- (laughter) -- Karen Pence is in the house. Would you make her feel welcome? (Applause.)Im very humbled to have raised my right hand just a few short weeks ago to accept the responsibilities and be Vice President of the United States of America. And by the power vested in me, I hear by grant amnesty for all minor conduct offenses of those present. (Applause.)Im not sure Ill be asked back now. But its really good to be with you all and, frankly, very humbling.I came here on behalf of the President of the United States, your Commander-in-Chief, President Donald Trump, and I bring you his greetings and his gratitude. (Applause.) I left the Oval Office when I headed to West Point this afternoon, and the President insisted that I send his greetings to all of you, his heartfelt thanks for your willingness to serve our great country.But more than that, the President sends his commitment to you that President Donald Trump and this administration will stand with you as you stand to defend the United States of America. (Applause.)I tell you its the greatest privilege of my life to serve with the 45th President. But its a special honor to serve with a President so dedicated to Americas Armed Forces.You know, being here tonight is a humbling experience for me, and its very moving. You see, Im not a soldier. My life did not take that path. But I am the son of a soldier and the proud father of a United States Marine. My father, youll be glad to know, Ed Pence, was member of the United States Army. (Applause.) My dad served in combat in Korea. And hes one of those people that earned some medals on this chest and came home and put them in the drawer. The best man I ever knew. Hes been gone some three decades now in our family, but hes still the greatest influence on my life every day.Im not only the proud son of someone in the service, but my wife, Karen, and I are also the proud parents of a son who answered the call of duty. Our son is right now serving in the Marine Corps as a second lieutenant. And like all of you, his highest hope is to serve our country with great distinction. And on behalf of all of your parents, these parents say, you all make us proud. Give yourselves a round of applause, would you please? (Applause.)I know your parents have the same faith that we have, that each one of you are going to continue this path you have chosen with great distinction. We have faith in you and faith in the principles you've come to serve.We have faith because of those who have walked this same path as you, in ages past. The training that you're receiving here has been generations in the making. I just had a wonderful gathering with a number of your most distinguished and accomplished fellow cadets. And I heard their calling here was not just to serve the country, but to grow as leaders.Were really standing -- we're standing where generations have stood -- on hallowed ground. If you think about it, for over 200 years, men and women from across our country have come to these grounds, driven here by that call to serve, that call to leadership -- of duty, honor, country.They came here separately, in different eras, with different pasts. Yet they all left as one, didn't they? Forever bound to each other each one of you are, as brothers and sisters, gripping hands in the Long Grey Line. And the American people are proud of each and every one of you in this room.That line remains unbroken to this day, and so long as it continues, everyone who calls our country home can know with absolute certainty that the United States of America -- our home, our homeland -- will be safe.So it is humbling for me to be here, one of the people that has been benefited by those countless generations that have gone before. Its humbling especially to be where so many courageous Americans prepare to protect families like mine. And its humbling to stand before all of you, who gladly follow in their footsteps.You are all already true leaders, and you are all already patriots.President Trump and I thank you. We thank you for answering the call to serve your country -- to put America first.Now, President Trump has made a solemn promise to all of you and to everyone who wears the uniform. On Monday, he gave a speech earlier this week, in which he essentially promised to stand with and protect those who protect us. He promised in his words to give you the tools, the equipment, the resources, the training, and the supplies you need to get the job done. And he promised to honor our sacred bond to those who serve. These are the Presidents promises to all of you. And make no mistake about it those promises will be kept in this administration. (Applause.) Thats really why Im here tonight on the Presidents behalf. Honoring those who serve our country requires recognizing the men and women who achieve extraordinary things in the line of duty.Theres a passage in the Old Book. I try and open it up and read it every morning. It says, If you owe debts, pay debts. If honor, then honor. If respect, then respect. And tonight marks the 40th Annual Lieutenant Henry O. Flipper Dinner, which is all about doing just that. It commemorates a man who we just heard overcame extraordinary adversity -- demonstrated leadership, self-discipline, and courage in service to this country.The year 1877, only twelve years before, the horrible evil of slavery, that great stain on our experiment in self-government, had finally been eradicated in the fires of the Civil War. And out of those ashes emerged hope -- hope that Americas founding promise of equality and freedom would finally be made real for all Americans.It was in this hope that spurred Henry Flipper to write his congressman, James Freeman, to request an appointment to the finest military academy in the world. Henrys skill with the written word impressed Freeman, we are told, who determined that he was indeed worthy.So came Henry Flipper to where we stand today. All who attend West Point face many trials, but Henry Flipper faced many more that we all understand by virtue of his willingness to challenge the status quo, challenge the injustices of his day.He persevered through four years, making history as the First African American ever to graduate from the United States Military Academy. But as we just heard his struggles would continue. He was ejected from the Army only four years later after being accused of a crime he did not commit.After Henry passed away, a band of patriotic Americans took up his cause. And thanks to their efforts, the Army righted this wrong by retroactively awarding Henry Flipper an honorable discharge in 1976. And you heard that President Clinton pardoned him in the years that followed.The following year after he was honorably discharged, his alma mater began to celebrate his accomplishments with the first installment of the dinner we have here tonight. Fittingly, Im told the first Henry O. Flipper Dinner was held 100 years after his groundbreaking graduation from West Point. Altogether fitting.But the purpose of tonight, Im told, is not just to remember Henry Flipper and his extraordinary courage and accomplishment, but its held every year in the midst of African American History Month.A week ago today, President Trump signed a proclamation honoring this occasion and declaring that the history of African Americans exemplifies the resilience and the spirit that continue to make our Nation great.We need only look at Henry Flippers life to see this truth in this statement. But we should also look back to the generations of African Americans who have defended and died for this country as far back as the very hour of our nations birth.When I think of these brave men and women, I can't help but think of that famous painting, its known as Washingtons Crossing. It depicts George Washington and his band crossing the Delaware. If you look closely, if you havent looked at that painting, and its one of my favorites, youll see someone who is sometimes overlooked. Next to General Washington himself, immediately to his left, is a young African American solider.The symbolism is profound. The painting was rendered by a German abolitionist who was determined to recognize the countless African Americans who fought side by side with our Founders in the pursuit of a free America -- of liberty and equality for all.Men like Crispus Attucks, who perished in the Boston Massacre, or Lemuel Hayes, who fought at Lexington and Concord, or the dozens who enlisted in the First Rhode Island Regiment, just to name a few.In New England, some African American patriots rose as high as the rank of colonel. Yet no matter their rank, they were, all of them, every bit as freedom-loving and dedicated to independence as George Washington himself.Tonight I think of them -- but, of course, not only them. I think of the nearly 200,000 African Americans who fought for the Union in the Civil War and for the new birth of freedom that followed it.I think of the Buffalo Soldiers we learned tonight that Henry Flipper was among them who actually helped tame the West. I think of the Tuskegee Airmen who flew for freedom in World War Two -- men like General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., whose strength of character carried him through four difficult years at West Point, and who is now honored for his resolve with a barracks that bears his name. I think of all these heroes in this month, and many more I havent mentioned, because they are the best of us.And during this month, African American History Month, but not only this month, we remember them and we thank them for what they did. Their names and their sacrifices will never be forgotten. For they understood the promise of America -- the timeless ideals that bind us together as a people, and give us purpose as a nation.That's why we are here tonight. We know in our hearts that America is extraordinary and that our sacred birthright must be defended, no matter the cost. This gift has always inspired our fellow Americans to step up and serve, and I believe it always will.It certainly inspired Henry Flipper and all those that we reflect on tonight. He persevered not just through four years at West Point, but over injustice itself. We remember and honor him tonight for his unyielding tenacity in the face of hardship.Henrys life always be a model for those who find towering barriers standing before them waiting to be overcome. For 40 years now, the United States Corps of Cadets has chosen one of its own who has embodied Henrys courage, his leadership, his determination to let no obstacle stand in his way. And tonight that honor falls to Cadet Lars Lofgren. (Applause.) Cadet Lofgren personifies the legacy of Henry Flipper and all the other previous recipients of the Flipper award. As all of you know, two years ago, Cadet Lofgren was tragically injured during a training exercise at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Since that day, he has been paralyzed from the waist down. But he didnt let it stop him. Less than 12 months later, he participated -- I had to read this twice -- he participated in the 2016 Warrior Games, where he won an astounding seven medals. (Applause.)Not only that, he then returned to West Point to complete his final year -- such is his love for America, for this great institution, and his sense of duty.Cadet Lofgren, you are an inspiration to us all. You are truly a worthy recipient of the Henry Flipper Award. And Im honored to be here tonight to be a part of watching you receive it. And tonight you will receive it from none other than one of Henrys descendants, Ken Davis. And we thank him so much for being with us today.I know everyone joins me in congratulating Cadet Lofgren and the honor he gives us by being here tonight.The legacy of Henry Flipper lives on in many others, including two distinguished guests we have with us tonight.Pat Locke, who retired from the Army as a major, is here with us this evening. Shes a trailblazer cut from the same cloth as Henry Flipper himself. In 1980, she departed from these grounds -- stand up and take a bow. Would you please? (Applause.) Thank you, Major. In 1980, she departed from these grounds as the first-ever, female African American graduate of West Point.We also have with us Cadet Christian Nattiel. He is the first African American from West Point to receive the prestigious Rhodes Scholarship and will soon head to Oxford to teach them a thing or two. (Applause.)All those whom I have recognized are heirs of a long and proud tradition that stretches back into the mists of American history. But they are not the only ones. It is this same tradition that really brings all of us here tonight and together.Now, we've not come to West Point, nor did our forefathers, because of the color of our skin or the creed we profess. We gather because of our country -- a country that has given us so much, and to which we are now called to give in return.One of my late fathers favorite versus was: To whom much is given, much will be required. And I know that every one of you that has stepped forward to be a part of this incredible tradition to serve your country feels that in your heart. You cadets before me have answered that call. You've stepped up, and soon you will go forth.Last night was Post Night, Im told, when the graduating seniors learned where they will be stationed. You will, all of you, do our country proud, so that future generations may yet call themselves sons and daughters of America. Lets give all of those who participated in Post Night a round of applause. (Applause.) Your accomplishments here at West Point, your leadership speaks louder than anyone could at a dinner like tonight.And your service is needed now more than ever. Beyond our nations borders lies a world riven by conflict and oftentimes wracked by chaos. Evil abounds across the globe. Old enemies have reared their ugly heads once more, and new ones have arisen, too.The forces of radical Islam terrorism seek to destroy not only our people, but our very way of life. The barbarians known as ISIS are brutally killing anyone who stands in the way of their attempts to establish a global caliphate. They will not stop until we stop them. And we will stop them. (Applause.)The threats facing America have never been more numerous, it seems sometimes, more sophisticated, more zealous in their adherence to failed ideas that belong in the ash-heap of history. But make no mistake about it: President Trump and this administration and this country will not rest until these enemies are destroyed and our nation is safe again. (Applause.)And I promise you -- I promise you, those of you that are preparing to enter the service of the United States of America on your graduation of West Point, we will not relent in our effort until we have rebuilt the arsenal of democracy and ensured that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guard have the resources and the training they need to accomplish their mission, protect our families, and come home safe to theirs. That is our promise. (Applause.)Rest assured, I can testify from what I see in him every day, America has a President and a Commander-in-Chief who loves the armed forces and will stand with you every day. Ive seen his dedication to you more times than I can count. In fact, I see it literally on a daily basis.Under his leadership, I can promise you three things. First, know that President Trump and I will always have your backs. You will have everything you need, and more, to defeat those who confront our nation and threaten our freedom, and to protect this country.Secondly, know that you and your families in the days ahead will always have our prayers, and the prayers of the American people will go with you as you serve. Of this Im confident.And last, know that we will always support you, not second-guess you, and we will never call your courageous service or your sacrifice a failure.Before I leave, I cant help but recall the words that the General just shared with me. We took a stroll, didn't we, General, down a block to see that MacArthur statue? And I polished his boot. (Laughter.) Before I left the Oval Office this afternoon, the President told me, you have to go down to the MacArthur statue. We did.And I read those words that were I think first spoken in this very room, and they're words that really represent the foundation of the past, present, and the future of this extraordinary institution and the tradition that you've embraced -- duty, honor, country.MacArthur said: Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, and what you will be. They are your rallying points to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes forlorn.Stirring words on a cold night, they warmed my heart because I knew Id be looking out on a roomful of men and women who were living out that every single day.You know to serve with President Trump is to serve with someone who has boundless confidence in the American people and boundless optimism about Americas future. And its an honor to be with you tonight.But let me say what the President would say if he was here, that looking out at your shining faces, seeing your dedication to America, we're more confident than ever that the best days for America are yet to come.Thank you. God bless you. God bless West Point. And God bless the United States of America.END 7:33 P.M. EST",20172.4,118.06000000000131,5715.18,32.73000000000047,2307.87,13.199999999999818

116,2017-02-09,President Trump Signs Pro-Law Enforcement and Anti-Crime Executive Orders,"Today the President signedthree Executive Orders to fight crime, gangs, and drugs; restore law and order; and support the dedicated men and women of law enforcement.In the last year there has been violence and threats against law enforcement officials. These attacks on police are attacks on all Americans.These Executive Orders recognize that the most important crime-fighting measure is to stand behind the officers who are on the front lines. The people who risk their lives every day to protect Americans need to know they are supported 100 percent.That is why this first executive order will place the government firmly on the side of federal, state, tribal, and local law enforcement. This will ensure that funding supports officers on the street, and anyone who tries to do them harm will be aggressively prosecuted.The second Executive Order will instruct the Attorney General to form a task force to look at how crime can be reduced and public safety increased.The third Executive Order instructsthe Attorney General to form a separate task force to focus on destroying transnational criminal organizations and drug cartels. These dangerous groups bring drugsand violence to once- peaceful neighborhoods in the United States and around the world. They have fueled addiction and fatal overdoses. They will no longer operate with impunity in this country or this hemisphere.",20172.4,118.06000000000131,5715.18,32.73000000000047,2307.87,13.199999999999818
117,2017-02-09,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/9/2017, #11","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:53 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Here we go. Good afternoon, everyone. As you just saw, the President was honored to host the swearing-in of Attorney General Sessions in the Oval Office just a short time ago.Under Attorney General Sessions, the Justice Department will return to its original, core mission: to uphold the rule of law to ensure that justice is administered and enforced fairly and impartially for all Americans. Attorney General Sessions is a world-class legal mind and experienced prosecutor, and the President is pleased to have him finally in place as our nations top law enforcement officer.After the Attorney Generals swearing-in, the President signed three executive orders dedicated to standing behind the police officers who risk their lives every day to protect us and our communities, reducing crime, and stopping cartel violence.The first executive order directs the newly installed Attorney General to develop a strategy for more effectively prosecuting people who commit violence against members of law enforcement. We must better protect those who protect us. Our men and women in blue need to know that we're with them 100 percent as they patrol our streets.Unfortunately, this has not always been the case. Law enforcement officials have been vocal about the lack of support they received under the past administration. This lack of support demoralized many officers and, in some cases, led to their discouraging their engagement with local communities, only causing further harm and deterioration.It's imperative that federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies better coordinate and share information across jurisdictions to better serve and protect our communities. This order will start the important work of doing just that, instituting a holistic approach that involves the whole of government. It also directs the Department of Justice to work with other federal agencies to come up with ways to further reduce violence against law enforcement, and orders a hard look at how the Department of Justice and other agencies use their law enforcement grants.The second order establishes a task force, led by the new Attorney General, to reduce crime and restore public safety in communities across America. Together, the members of this task force are going to come up with specific recommendations -- how we can change existing federal law to better prevent crime and improve public safety, and develop stronger working relationships with our state and local partners. The President is confident that this task force will develop a systematic strategy to help further protect the American people.Communities across our nation have been devastated by a surge in violent-crime rates, particularly in our major cities. Over the last eight years, we've experienced declining focus on law and order. Crime reduction will clearly be a priority for this White House.The last executive order re-focuses the energy and resources of the federal government to dismantle transnational criminal organizations, such as drug cartels. It's important to emphasize that we cannot reduce crime in the United States without additionally addressing illegal immigration and illegal drugs. Through this executive order, the President instructs the Attorney General to form a comprehensive and decisive approach to destroying transnational crime organizations and drug cartels.These cartels represent a clear and present danger to our nation. They bring dangerous criminals, drugs, and violence to once-peaceful neighborhoods both here at home and in other parts of the world. They have fueled addiction and overdose deaths, and they can no longer be allowed to operate with impunity in our country or our hemisphere.This order pulls together the experience and resources of federal agencies to work towards emphasizing specific goals in this regard. Number one, to upgrade our information-gathering about these transnational organizations and cartels. Without accurate information about these threats, and the ability and willingness to share this information, we're not going to be able to tackle this problem. It's important to note that, prior to this administration, if you had called the Department of Justice to ask for these statistics, they never kept them. So knowing what we're facing is a big part of addressing the problem.Number two, improving the speed and efficiency of removing criminal aliens, cartel members, and people who help cartels from our nation. Unlike during the last eight years, these criminals are finally going to go home.Three, shift whatever resources we can to tackling these organizations and prevent them from disrupting our society any further.Now, on to the Presidents schedule. This morning, the President held a breakfast and listening session with key stakeholders in the airline industry. We've got a participant list if you're interested. The President thanked the attendees for the 10 million jobs and $1 trillion in annual economic activity they contribute to our economy, and praised them for moving approximately 2 million passengers per day in spite of the outdated infrastructure and equipment that they have in terms of air traffic control and other infrastructure measures.The President asked the aviation leaders what the government can do to help their industry grow and create more well-paying jobs for Americans. The leaders commented that they had never been given the opportunity to truly work alongside the President in such an open and constructive way. And they were unanimous in asking for the President to offer relief from the duplicative and burdensome regulations that are stifling job creation, which he assured them he'd do.The President also reaffirmed his commitment to foregoing -- to forging, rather, public-private partnerships that will rebuild Americas crumbling infrastructure. He pledged to work closely with the airline industry to modernize the technology systems that keep our nations airports running, and to expedite the approval process for future airline infrastructure projects. It's the Presidents goal to make sure the United States has the most advanced airline system in the world, and this meeting was an important first step in achieving that.After the executive order signing, the President spoke with the President of Afghanistan and the Emir of Qatar. My understanding is that we should have readouts shortly on both of those calls. Just concluding, a few moments ago the President held a Supreme Court and legislative listening session and lunch with Democratic and Republican senators. In attendance were Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa; Senator Heitkamp of North Dakota; Senator Tester of Montana; Senator Donnelly of Indiana; Senator Manchin of West Virginia; Senator Moore Capito, also of West Virginia; Senator Cornyn of Texas; Senator Alexander Of Tennessee; Senator Coons of Delaware, and Senator Bennet of Colorado.The President expressed his hope that these senators and their colleagues will give Judge Gorsuch a fair consideration and vote based on his qualifications to serve on the Supreme Court. With over 100 federal judicial nominations potentially happening during this administration, it's critical for us to have open dialogue and work towards bipartisan agreement so that our justice system returns to its important work on behalf of the American people.Later today, the President will speak with the Emir of Kuwait and the Prime Minister of Iraq. He will provide readouts -- or we will provide readouts of those calls moving towards the conclusion of them.We also anticipate that the Senate will hold a vote to confirm Secretary-designate Price this evening or into the early hours of Friday to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services.The President was glad to see that the Army Corps of Engineers announced last night the final easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline. With this final federal authorization completed, and the President working to reduce further unnecessary delays, this infrastructure project can finally continue to move forward. The construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline was one of the Presidents campaign promises and the subject of one of his first executive orders. The administration is pleased that Americans will be going to work building this pipeline, and building it with American steel whenever possible.Now, looking to the upcoming schedule. Tomorrow, the President will welcome Prime Minister Abe of Japan. The President and the Prime Minister will hold a press conference at 1:00 p.m. in the East Room. They will depart Washington around 3:00 tomorrow afternoon for Mar-A-Lago, where the President is honored to host the Prime Minister at the Winter White House.As we recently announced just earlier today, Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada will visit the White House on Monday. The President looks forward to a constructive conversation and strengthening the deep relationship that exists between the United States and Canada. The President will also host Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel next Wednesday. Well have further guidance on the press availability potentials for either one of those. One last thing before I take your questions, amid surging levels of CEO confidence and in the wake of the incredible jobs announcement made at the White House yesterday by Intel, there's also new numbers released today by the Department of Labor showing that unemployment claims are at near historic lows.The President knows better than anyone what businesses need to create jobs, and the market is responding to his policy improvements. This administration will continue to roll back burdensome regulations and lower the overall tax burden on Americans so they can hire even more people and create even more innovative projects.With that, Ill take your questions. Kaitlan Collins.Q  Thank you. Hundreds of bureaucrats at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau make more than members of Congress. Forty of them make more than Vice President Mike Pence. Does the President have plans to revamp this agency? And if so, does he feel that he should be able to fire the head of the agency at his will?MR. SPICER: I think I've addressed this before, but we have no updates right now on the head of CFPB. If we do, Ill let you know.With respect to the first part of that question, I think one of the things that youre going to continue to see from this President is a respects for taxpayers dollars, the money they spend, and how theyre spent. We are going to continue to review all aspects of government. I think youll see further announcements as far as how hes going to look at -- how hes going to approach and innovate and update government. The bottom line is that we should be paying people a fair wage for their service to this country, but that we should doing it in the most effective and efficient manner. And I think thats what the President has already shown towards his commitment towards helping reduce the cost of several programs through the government and bringing back jobs. But theres going to be a respect for taxpayers in this administration, so that whether it's salaries or actual positions or programs, hes going to have a very, very tough look at how were operating government, how many positions they're in, what people are getting paid. But the President understands that most Americans are out there working night and day trying to get by, and that Washington truly needs to respect the money that they spend, and that we should be doing it in a way that shows that -- with a level of respect in terms of how many people are hiring, what theyre paid, what programs were looking at, whether or not that program is duplicative. But its not just about one department or one agency. Its really about looking at how government as a whole operates.John.Q  Sean, questions have been raised after Kellyanne Conway did an interview, I believe it was with Fox News this morning, where she appeared to, from the confines of the Brady Briefing room, promote the products of Ivanka Trump. Do you believe that she crossed an ethical line?MR. SPICER: Kellyanne has been counseled and thats all were going to go with. Shes been counseled on that subject, and thats it.Q  And could I ask a question. Reuters has a story out that includes a partial transcript of the Presidents call with Vladimir Putin, in which he appears to express doubts about the New START Treaty. Does he indeed have doubts about the New START Treaty? Would he like to see that renegotiated?MR. SPICER: The Presidents conversation with President Putin is a private call between the two of them, and Im going to leave it at that. We put a readout on the call, and we have nothing further beyond that.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. One question today.MR. SPICER: Wow. Q  (Laughter.) On February 2nd, Vladimir Kara-Murza, who is a well-known filmmaker in Russia and was a close associate of the late Boris Nemtsov, the dissident, found himself in critical condition. His wife has since said she believes this is poisoning, very much like the conditions that almost took his life two years ago. And does the administration have any comment about that, or the frustration of Mr. Navalny, the opponent of President Putin to get on the ballot as a candidate?MR. SPICER: I think our State Department is aware of the situation, were monitoring it, and Ill leave it at that.Blake.Q  Sean, the President said today in the airlines representative meeting that he hopes to have an announcement within the next two to three weeks about lowering the burden of taxes for businesses. At the Super Bowl interview, he was asked, can Americans expect a tax break in 2017, and he said, ""I think so, yes. I would like to say yes."" It sounds like hes a little bit more confident for the businesses than individual tax breaks for Americans. Is the business component at this point ahead of the individual component? MR. SPICER: No, its a comprehensive -- yeah -- thanks for asking. I think were looking at, in the next few weeks, rolling out the outline of a comprehensive tax plan that well be working with Congress on that will address both the business side of the tax ledger as well as the individual rates. But its going to be a comprehensive plan, something that we havent seen since 1986.But I think when you look at the segueing of that, weve got two opportunities for reconciliation this year. One is using the FY17 budget, which you can easily get Obamacare repeal and replace done, and then you can use the FY18 budget to utilize the second opportunity at reconciliation to do comprehensive reform. But we recognize the need. I mean, its been since 1986 that something like this, of this scale and magnitude, had happened. The President recognizes that middle-class Americans need tax relief, and thats going to be part of that. But we also recognize -- and you saw that in all of these businesses meetings, whether its inversions or other means in which people are shipping jobs overseas or reestablishing themselves or the profits that are kept over there -- we need fundamental, comprehensive tax reform that addresses both sides of that income stream. Q  Can you say if this is going to be a mix between what he had put out there on the campaign and what House Republicans had put out there before? Because theres some similarities but clearly some differences as well.MR. SPICER: Im just going to say that you're going to have to wait a couple weeks before we put out that outline. But I can tell you that its something that is going to spur economic growth. Its going to recognize the need to give so many working Americans the relief that they need.But more importantly, I think part of the issue that we continue to see over and over again with businesses is that we're facing competition from abroad because of our tax code. It favors companies from not wanting to stay, and the President recognizes that. And what he wants to do is create a tax climate that not only keeps jobs here but makes it -- incentivizes companies to want to come here, to grow here, to create jobs here, to bring their profits back here. So I think -- I don't want to get any further ahead of it, but I will tell you that it is going to be the first time that this nation has seen a full comprehensive tax reform in a long, long time.Yes.Q  Yes, the President this morning tweeted that our country is bogged down in conflict all over the place. Where are we bogged down?MR. SPICER: I think there are several places that we've been --Q  What does he mean by that?MR. SPICER: I think that if you look at ISIS in particular and the hotspots around the country, the places that we have to monitor, there's a lot of countries through the Middle East in particular -- Northern Africa -- that we are having to address and deal with and monitor because of the threat of radical Islamic terrorism. There's no question that the spread of it has gone -- in the last eight years has proliferated. And I think that the resources that we have to spend -- this isnt a traditional war where you're just looking at the other enemy with a uniform and saying, heres the country we're fighting. The proliferation of ISIS throughout this country has made it so that we have to focus a lot more in a lot more places and expend a lot more resources because its more of a disparate approach that we have to employ, as opposed to having one country that you're facing at one time.Q  But bogged down suggests its something we can't get out of?MR. SPICER: I just answered the question. I understand.Q  Thank you, Sean. And happy Lantern Festival to you. MR. SPICER: Happy Lantern Festival to you.Q  Thank you. Regarding the very nice letter that President Trump sent to President Xi Jinping last night, Im curious about the timing. And also in the letter, President Trump said hes looking forward to the event of constructive relationship with China. So could you elaborate the importance of this bilateral relationship to the U.S.?MR. SPICER: Well, I think its obviously important to us. And the President understands that. I think hes spoken fairly often about China, and he understands both the national and economic interests that we have, the desire for our companies to access the Chinese market, but also the national security interests that we have. And so he obviously wants to do what he can to have a fruitful and constructive relationship with China, and he looks forward to developing that as we go forward.Sarah.Q  Sean, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said today that they could use a few thousand more troops in Afghanistan to help the coalition efforts there. Going off Mikes question, if we're trying to get out of conflicts like that, does the administration plan to send those additional forces to Afghanistan?MR. SPICER: I think the President will heed the advice of the generals and Secretary Mattis. That conversation has yet to happen -- and if we have any further announcements. But I think that's right now a Department of Defense issue that you should raise with.Hallie.Q  Sean, two questions for you. I want to get to one on immigration. But first on the comments from Judge Gorsuch that have been reported out, I just have a two-parter. But does the President still stand by his nomination?MR. SPICER: Absolutely.Q  Given where Gorsuch stands --MR. SPICER: That's number one?Q  No, the second part of a two-part. MR. SPICER: Oh. (Laughter.) Q  Given where --MR. SPICER: Im not calling on you anymore. Q  Given Judge Gorsuchs position on the Presidents attitude toward the judiciary, and given that the President has praised Neil Gorsuch for his intellect and for his integrity, does the President have any regrets about the comments that hes made about federal judges?MR. SPICER: I think the Presidents comments speak for -- no, he has no regrets. But hes very proud of the selection that hes made, and hes going to make a great associate justice to the Supreme Court.Q  Now about the selection, but about the comments that he said, for example, about Judge --MR. SPICER: I understand that, I just -- he has no regrets. Thank you.Q  On immigration, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos --MR. SPICER: Look what you started, April Ryan.Q  Why are you calling me out? I didnt do anything. (Laughter.) Q  I know the White House, I'm sure, has been following the situation of Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos. And so I want to know, does the President believe she should have been deported? And what message does he have to others in her position?MR. SPICER: Yeah, Im going to refer you back to ICE on that. Thats an ICE matter.Q  The President has no comment?MR. SPICER: The issue is developing in Arizona right now, and I would refer you back to ICE.Margaret.Q  Shes in Mexico right now, though.MR. SPICER: Id refer you back to ICE.Q  Sean, in that lunch meeting, the President said that -- he basically said Senator Blumenthals comments were taken out of context, and that --MR. SPICER: Well, no, Judge Gorsuchs comments were -- yeah.Q  Judge Gorsuch, right. And that his relaying of Judge Gorsuchs comments were taken out of context. However, Senator Ayotte, who is working with the White House to help shepherd Judge Gorsuch through the Hill, released a statement confirming those same remarks, disheartening and demoralizing. MR. SPICER: Right, so heres what --Q  Is the President aware of that? Because she was in that meeting.MR. SPICER: No, no, of course hes aware. This is what Senator Ayotte said: ""Judge Gorsuch has made it very clear in all of his discussions with senators, including Senator Blumenthal, that he could not comment on [any] specific cases, and that judicial ethics prevent him from commenting on political matters. He has also emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary, and while he made clear that he was not referencing* [referring to] any specific case, he said that he finds any criticism of a judges integrity and independence disheartening and demoralizing.So there is a big difference between commenting on the specific comments that had been made in the tweet and his general philosophy about the judiciary and his respect for his fellow judges. And I think the senators comments were very clear about how those are two distinct issues.Q  Right. And the judges comments as relayed through others were also in that context of the Presidents attacks on the judiciary, which is what the senator you just read out was also talking about there.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  Was the President aware of that? Because Senator Ayotte was sitting right across from him when he said that those comments were inaccurately reported or conveyed.MR. SPICER: No, the way that Senator Blumenthal characterized them, he was talking about the tweets and saying that he was disheartened. Thats not what the judge said. He was making two very complete, distinct arguments about how he views the comments that he should not be commenting on a political matter or on specific things.But as a whole, he doesnt like attacks in general on the judiciary. It was a very distinct argument that he was making. And I think that thats where I think weve got to be clear, and thats what Senator Ayotte was saying this morning. Very, very different. Cecilia. Q  Is he to take that on board? I mean --MR. SPICER: Is he what?Q  Is he taking that on board? I mean, you just said he doesnt regret his past attacks on the judiciary. MR. SPICER: Right.Q  But now you have these confirmed remarks, which you were saying were exactly what the judge was talking about.MR. SPICER: No, no --Q  And thats not changing the Presidents own --MR. SPICER: But hold on -- but, again, I think its important to understand that the judge was very clear that he was not commenting on any specific matter, right? And then the he was asked about his general philosophy. So you cant then take that -- equate it back to the specific. He literally went out of his way to say, Im not commenting on a specific instance. So to take what he said about a generalization and apply it to a specific is exactly what he was intending not to do.Q  In other words, the President will continue to speak like this.MR. SPICER: Of course he will. The President is going to speak his mind. It goes back to Thomas Jefferson, that Presidents have commented on judicial nominees. I mean, the idea of one branch talking about or commenting on another branch is as old as our republic. So I dont know why -- and I find it interesting when President Obama criticized the Supreme Court for its Citizens United comments in the State of the Union, there wasnt a similar concern about that. The idea that this is --Q  Well, I guess the ""so-called judge"" portion of it, the personal attack.MR. SPICER: But at some point it seems like there is clearly a double standard when its -- how this is applied. When President Obama did it, there was no concern from this briefing room. When he does it, its a ton of outrage.So I just -- with all due respect, I think the President has made very clear that he was concerned about how that executive order in particular, which is what were talking about, was applied. And I think weve addressed it from this briefing room over and over and over again that the U.S. code gives the President very clear authority to make this happen.Cecilia.Q  I want to make sure I understand what youre saying. Are you saying that demoralizing and disheartening was not specifically about the Presidents comments and what he said? And if so, how does the President know that? Has he spoken to the Judge?MR. SPICER: No, I think the Judge literally made it very clear in his comments.Q  But three senators have come out and said that they corroborate that statement, and said that --MR. SPICER: I understand that. Senator Ayotte, who was there, made it very clear that he was commenting in general about attacks on the judiciary. That was it. Plain and simple.Q  But three other senators have said, and the spokesman and for the Judge, on the record. MR. SPICER: I understand that, Cecilia. I can tell you that Senator Ayotte, who has been with him on every single thing, was very clear about that. Theres no -- so I understand that. And that is -- she has made it very clear over and over again.Yes.Q  Sean, your answer about the context doesn't make sense when you think about what Senator Ben Sasse said today and this morning on TV. He said that he asked Judge Gorsuch specifically about the Presidents so-called judge tweet. And in response --MR. SPICER: Phil, this is like the fourth time Ive asked and answered.Q  No, but this is a different context, Sean.MR. SPICER: I understand that. Phil, I have asked --Q  This is directly about the President's tweet.MR. SPICER: I understand that. And Ive said exactly what Senator Ayotte said about it. I don't know how many times you guys --Q  But her comment was only about Blumenthal.MR. SPICER: I understand, thank you.Q  Sean, I'm going to continue on this line, despite what was just happening there. Why isnt the White House, why isnt the President concerned about the influence or the appearance of the influence on the independent judiciary?MR. SPICER: Why isnt he -- I mean, he is free to speak his mind. Where has this outrage been for the last hundred years? There has been --Q  I'm not asking about the Obama administration or any previous administration, Im talking about this President and this White House.MR. SPICER: I understand that. And the President has -- part of the reason the President got elected is because he speaks his mind. He doesn't hold it back. Hes authentic. And hes not going to sit back, I think, when he feels very passionately about something as much as the executive order.He was doing it to make sure Americans were safe. The order -- the U.S. code is crystal-clear on this. I think Ive read it for like three days in a row. And it can't be any clearer how much authority it gives the President to do what he can to keep us safe. Hes concerned that hes doing what he can to keep this country safe, and there has been a lot of activity to stand in the way. So Im not sure how many more times I can read the code to you. But 8 U.S. Code, 1182 --Q  Yes, but you and me talking about it is not how the judicial process works.MR. SPICER: Thank you. You've asked the question now eight times.Q  One more Id like to ask you. One more about a different set of comments.MR. SPICER: You've got -- hold on. I understand. Thank you, go ahead.Q  About a different set of comments that have been made, Sean, also from Kellyanne Conway earlier this week.Q  Let him go. Let him go.Q  Earlier this week. You say the -- this is in context of Nordstrom and not about what she was counseled about, but about something she said to CNN earlier this week, is that the President doesn't comment on everything. And so I want to contrast the Presidents repeated statements about Nordstrom with the lack of comments about some other things, including, for example, the attack on a Quebec mosque and other similar environments. Why is the President -- when he chooses to --MR. SPICER: Do you -- hold on -- because you just brought that up. I literally stand at this podium and opened a briefing a couple days ago about the President expressing his condolences. I literally opened the briefing about it. So for you to sit there and say --Q  I was here. MR. SPICER: I know. So why are you asking why he didn't do it when I literally stood here and did it?Q  The Presidents statement --MR. SPICER: I don't understand what you're asking.Q  Kellyannes comments were about that the President doesn't have time to tweet about everything.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  Hes tweeting about this.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  Hes not tweeting about something else.MR. SPICER: I came out here and actually spoke about it and said the President spoke --Q  I'm talking about the Presidents time.MR. SPICER: What are you -- you're equating me addressing the nation here and a tweet? I don't -- that's the silliest thing Ive ever heard. Q  Im talking about an attack on Nordstrom on --MR. SPICER: Okay, Im done. This is silly. Okay, next. Q  -- and an attack on people, and you're equating --MR. SPICER: Thank you. You've asked your question. Thank you.Q  Does that not diminish the language that you're using?MR. SPICER: Thank you. Go ahead.Q  Thank you, Sean. One of the criticisms leveled at President Trumps predecessor, President Obama, by Republicans was his excessive use of executive orders. The President signed three more executive orders today. Why isnt that criticism applicable to President Trump in the same manner that President Obama -- MR. SPICER: I think when you look at the context of what they -- yes, what those executive orders did, and theres things that are within the bounds of trying to protect this country and ordering police officers -- nothing that I think even Democrats would complain, with the exception of the one that we've had conversations on. Most of them have been widely praised by both parties to keep this country safe, to get jobs creation back. Most of them have widely applauded. I think the difference with what President Obama did was stretch the executive order to take actions that had largely been within the realm of Congress, and to do things that didn't allow for prior input. The stuff that the President is doing is almost entirely highly applauded by both sides of the aisle and won tremendous praise. There's a big difference in the context in which those two administrations operated. Q  One of the criticisms in addition to that was that President Obama in using those EOs was governing by executive fiat, he wasnt working with Congress. Does the President plan to use --MR. SPICER: Right. But again, I think --Q  -- Congress in a legislative manner?MR. SPICER: Absolutely. And I just mentioned both tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare -- immigration. There are so many areas where the President -- he literally just -- we held up this briefing a little so that eight United States senators could walk out and talk about -- and again, that meeting, while it was focused on the judiciary, they talked about infrastructure. They talked about other priorities that they have. He has shown a commitment to work across the aisle to bring folks in, to listen, to hear their thoughts, to get ideas on a legislative agenda that they can move together with. So I think there is a big difference between the last administration that sort of shunned Congresss role, and this administration where the President is actively seeking their input and ideas, and helping them craft an agenda to move the country forward.Alexis.Q  Can I follow up on the tax question?MR. SPICER: Sure.Q  Because there are revenue elements of the Affordable Care Act, if it is repealed and replaced -- there has been discussion on the Hill about what would be the appropriate track to get that into tax legislation or how to treat the tax legislation. If the President is interested in unveiling a tax package that is as comprehensive as you just described, would the revenue elements of the Affordable Care Act be on a separate track? Or is he talking about folding them into one reconciliation package?MR. SPICER: So right now, as I mentioned at the outset, I think we're primarily looking at two reconciliation tracks -- one utilizing the 2017 budget. So you could put your Obamacare repeal and replace in the 2017 reconciliation package, and then you could potentially do tax reform -- comprehensive tax reform in the 2018 budget.But I also want to say -- just so we're clear, these aren't prescriptive. I think we continue to work towards Congress on a range of options and ideas to accomplish both of those and other goals. Those seem primarily the two most opportune ways to get this thing done. But I wouldnt want to rule in or anything out.I think both Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell are going to weigh in on what best vehicles can be utilized to make this thing happen. So I don't want to be prescriptive.Ben.Q  You talked about the Presidents tax reform plan in coming weeks. Is that something hes talked about with leaders in both houses of Congress? And are they prepared for this?MR. SPICER: Absolutely. I mean, as I mentioned, he has met with -- just wrapped up a meeting with Republicans and Democratic senators. But this is something that the legislative affairs team, as well as the President himself has engaged with members of Congress to talk about this both privately and in bigger groups. But there is a very large conversation going on to achieve bipartisan support for a package of this nature.Jonathan.Q  Does the President believe that its possible to balance the budget without major entitlement reform? Any sort of House --MR. SPICER: I think one of the things that the President has looked at is not just the cutting side, but the revenue stream. One area in particular -- natural resources regulation and tax reform, how we can grow the economy and bring in additional revenues to the government on the revenue side. So there is a balance to how the President is looking at bringing down the deficit.And I think before I get -- hes going to -- well have a budget out in a few weeks. I think that will answer a lot. But again, when it comes to deficit reduction, which is something that he is very interested in, that is not a one-side-of-the-ledger option; that a lot of what he is trying to talk about in these meetings and with business executives is how we can expand the economy. And that expanded economy, that job creation, those explorations of natural resources and additional new jobs also bring additional tax revenue in. So there's a way to do this. If we start bringing businesses back, creating more things, creating more jobs, that creates a revenue stream that has a significant impact on the deficit -- on being able to drive down the deficit and balancing the budget.So I think its not something I want to get in too much detail now, but I will tell you that I think the President has been very, very keen on trying to make sure that we look at the revenue side as much as we're looking at the spending side.When it comes to the spending side, again, you're looking at a whole-of-government approach at how we look at every department, every agency, every job, the spending -- or the hiring freeze being one of them. How do we make sure that we're looking at are these positions necessary? Are they duplicative? Are we using taxpayer money in the best possible way? Those are the whole -- it isnt a single -- like, look at those particular programs and try to figure out what we can do. Hes looking at everything and figuring out if we can make it more effective and efficient.Yes, Scott.Q  Yes, Sean, Monday, the House Oversight Committee is going to mark up Congressman Chaffetzs bill to strike down the District of Columbia's Death with Dignity Act, the assisted suicide law. It could soon come to the White House. Has the President articulated any thoughts on that or the other bills to strike down D.C.s gun laws, marijuana, funding for federal -- for abortions in the District? Any thoughts on all these things that are coming your way?MR. SPICER: As they come our way and they get passed by both houses and come this way, we will issue statements of administration policy. At this time, they are not at that position. So thank you, guys, very much. Well see you tomorrow with the Prime Minister. Take care.Q  On Mar-a-Lago --Q  One question.Q  Come back.MR. SPICER: Sorry, one quick one. On Mar-a-Lago, someone asked about it yesterday, so a quick follow-up. The President has offered as a gift to the Prime Minister, he will be his guest at Mar-a-Lago. No one else will be staying there, as far as I know, from the Japanese delegation. They will stay out in town with the rest of the staff. But that is a gift that the President is extending to the Prime Minister.Thank you, guys.END2:26 P.M. EST",20172.4,118.06000000000131,5715.18,32.73000000000047,2307.87,13.199999999999818
118,2017-02-09,Remarks by President Trump Before SCOTUS Listening Session,"Roosevelt Room12:41 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you all for coming. We had a couple of great meetings this morning -- the airline industry, we're going to get that one going. They've got a lot of problems but it's going to be good. We just had talks with Qatar and a couple of countries -- Afghanistan. I would say that that's a tough situation but we'll do something about it. We'll be having some -- we'll be giving you some pretty -- information -- pretty good information soon. We're going to have some good, big conversations with other world leaders over the next few hours. A lot of things happening, a lot of positive things.I want to start by thanking Senator Manchin for having the courage to vote for somebody that's really very outstanding, really outstanding -- as good as they've seen in a long time. Nominating the justice to the Supreme Court, a justice, has always been considered one of the very important things that a President can do. I guess I'm looking very much at defense and we're negotiating a lot of contracts with airlines and a lot of other people, but when you get right down to it, the F-35 Fighter is very important and all of the things we're doing are very important. But I've always considered, and I guess a lot of people have, the Supreme Court nominees to be right up there -- right up there. We'll take defense, number one, I think, Senator, we have to go with defense of our country, number one. And right after that, I suspect it's going to be Supreme Court justices. And Judge Gorsuch is an exceptionally qualified nominee -- probably there's rarely been anybody that's been more qualified. He has impeccable academic and legal credentials. He went to Columbia -- very, very great student. He went to Harvard, top of his class. He went to Oxford, great student, great intellect. He has an outstanding record for 10 years on the bench. One of the great writers they say -- legal writers -- I've read some of the things that he's written and, believe me, he is a great, great writer. He'll respect and very much respect the Constitution, as written, and he will apply the law as written. He's a mainstream judge, very much mainstream, and I urge you all to confirm him. He's been doing very well. A lot of people are liking him very much on the other side. And I think that, because of politics, perhaps they're not going to vote for him. I think that's a shame because that's not being honest. I've had a couple of people tell me from the other side -- because, believe it or not, I have a lot of friends on the other side too -- and they think he's outstanding. And then they go on to tell me that perhaps they won't be able to do that. But that's one of the reasons that our country is in stagnation in so many different forms and so many different ways. I think it's very dishonest and I think it's very unfortunate. But we'll see what happens. I think he's doing very well. And I know that some people are going to come on board and hopefully we can do this in a very quick and civil manner.The Cabinet slowly is happening. Jeff Sessions just got -- you're very happy about that -- because Jeff is outstanding. And we just swore in Jeff Sessions as Attorney General, and I think he's going to be outstanding.So I just want to thank you all for being here. We're going to have a good lunch and we're going to talk about our Supreme Court nominee, somebody who will do a fantastic job for many years to come. Thank you very much.Q  Mr. President, any comment on Judge Gorsuch's comments about you, sir?THE PRESIDENT: You misrepresented his comments.Q  I just wanted to ask you what your thoughts were, sir.THE PRESIDENT: His comments were misrepresented. And what you should do is ask Senator Blumenthal about his Vietnam record that didn't exist after years of saying it did. So ask Senator Blumenthal about his Vietnam record. He misrepresented that just like he misrepresented Judge Gorsuch.Thank you all very much.END12:45 P.M. EST",20172.4,118.06000000000131,5715.18,32.73000000000047,2307.87,13.199999999999818
119,2017-02-09,Presidential Executive Order on Enforcing Federal Law with Respect to Transnational Criminal Organizations and Preventing International Trafficking,"EXECUTIVE ORDER- - - - - - -ENFORCING FEDERAL LAW WITH RESPECT TO TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PREVENTING INTERNATIONAL TRAFFICKINGBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Purpose. Transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including transnational drug cartels, have spread throughout the Nation, threatening the safety of the United States and its citizens. These organizations derive revenue through widespread illegal conduct, including acts of violence and abuse that exhibit a wanton disregard for human life. They, for example, have been known to commit brutal murders, rapes, and other barbaric acts.These groups are drivers of crime, corruption, violence, and misery. In particular, the trafficking by cartels of controlled substances has triggered a resurgence in deadly drug abuse and a corresponding rise in violent crime related to drugs. Likewise, the trafficking and smuggling of human beings by transnational criminal groups risks creating a humanitarian crisis. These crimes, along with many others, are enriching and empowering these organizations to the detriment of the American people.A comprehensive and decisive approach is required to dismantle these organized crime syndicates and restore safety for the American people.Sec. 2. Policy. It shall be the policy of the executive branch to:(a) strengthen enforcement of Federal law in order to thwart transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including criminal gangs, cartels, racketeering organizations, and other groups engaged in illicit activities that present a threat to public safety and national security and that are related to, for example:(i)  the illegal smuggling and trafficking of humans, drugs or other substances, wildlife, and weapons;(ii)  corruption, cybercrime, fraud, financial crimes, and intellectual-property theft; or(iii) the illegal concealment or transfer of proceeds derived from such illicit activities.(b) ensure that Federal law enforcement agencies give a high priority and devote sufficient resources to efforts to identify, interdict, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including through the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of members of such organizations, the extradition of members of such organizations to face justice in the United States and, where appropriate and to the extent permitted by law, the swift removal from the United States of foreign nationals who are members of such organizations;(c) maximize the extent to which all Federal agencies share information and coordinate with Federal law enforcement agencies, as permitted by law, in order to identify, interdict, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations;(d) enhance cooperation with foreign counterparts against transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including, where appropriate and permitted by law, through sharing of intelligence and law enforcement information and through increased security sector assistance to foreign partners by the Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security;(e) develop strategies, under the guidance of the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to maximize coordination among agencies -- such as through the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF), Special Operations Division, the OCDETF Fusion Center, and the International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center -- to counter the crimes described in subsection (a) of this section, consistent with applicable Federal law; and(f) pursue and support additional efforts to prevent the operational success of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations within and beyond the United States, to include prosecution of ancillary criminal offenses, such as immigration fraud and visa fraud, and the seizure of the implements of such organizations and forfeiture of the proceeds of their criminal activity.Sec. 3. Implementation. In furtherance of the policy set forth in section 2 of this order, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence, or their designees, shall co-chair and direct the existing interagency Threat Mitigation Working Group (TMWG), which shall:(a) work to support and improve the coordination of Federal agencies' efforts to identify, interdict, investigate, prosecute, and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations within and beyond the United States;(b) work to improve Federal agencies' provision, collection, reporting, and sharing of, and access to, data relevant to Federal efforts against transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations;(c) work to increase intelligence and law enforcement information sharing with foreign partners battling transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, and to enhance international operational capabilities and cooperation;(d) assess Federal agencies' allocation of monetary and personnel resources for identifying, interdicting, and dismantling transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, as well as any resources that should be redirected toward these efforts;(e) identify Federal agencies' practices, any absence of practices, and funding needs that might hinder Federal efforts to effectively combat transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations;(f) review relevant Federal laws to determine existing ways in which to identify, interdict, and disrupt the activity of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, and ascertain which statutory authorities, including provisions under the Immigration and Nationality Act, could be better enforced or amended to prevent foreign members of these organizations or their associates from obtaining entry into the United States and from exploiting the United States immigration system;(g) in the interest of transparency and public safety, and in compliance with all applicable law, including the Privacy Act, issue reports at least once per quarter detailing convictions in the United States relating to transnational criminal organizations and their subsidiaries;(h) to the extent deemed useful by the Co-Chairs, and in their discretion, identify methods for Federal agencies to coordinate, as permitted by law, with State, tribal, and local governments and law enforcement agencies, foreign law enforcement partners, public-health organizations, and non-governmental organizations in order to aid in the identification, interdiction, and dismantling of transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations;(i) to the extent deemed useful by the Co-Chairs, and in their discretion, consult with the Office of National Drug Control Policy in implementing this order; and(j) within 120 days of the date of this order, submit to the President a report on transnational criminal organizations and subsidiary organizations, including the extent of penetration of such organizations into the United States, and issue additional reports annually thereafter to describe the progress made in combating these criminal organizations, along with any recommended actions for dismantling them.Sec. 4. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)  the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.DONALD J.

121,2017-02-09,Remarks by President Trump in Meeting with the Aviation Industry,"State Dining Room9:47 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you for being here. Nothing like having meetings in the White House. Good place. Good place for meetings. Good place for a lot of things. People dont realize I inherited a mess. A big mess. I think they know. I think they understand. Well, thank you all. I know so many of you through reading and through business magazines, and you've done an amazing job. And I want to congratulate you. I know you're under pressure from a lot of foreign elements and foreign carriers. I've been hearing that a little bit. At the same time, we want to make life good for them also. They come with big investments -- in many cases, those investments are made by their governments. But they are still big investments.I'm thrilled to welcome the leaders of the airline industry to the White House. Your industry supports over 10 million well-paying U.S. jobs and creates almost $1 trillion in economic activity, which is really big stuff, really amazing. Last year, our airlines moved approximately 2 million people each day in our country, which is an incredible number of people. And they move them well -- despite the bad equipment that the airports give you in many cases, because they can't get approvals, and we had regulatory morass that's a disaster.And I can tell you that a lot of the new equipment that already is obsolete the day they order it -- and that's according to people that know, including my pilot. I have a pilot who's a real expert, and he said, sir, the equipment they're putting on is just the wrong stuff. And we'll talk about that. Because if we're going to modernize our systems, we should be using the right equipment. And I know Mr. Tilden is nodding. You know what I mean. It's one thing to order equipment, but let's order the right equipment. Probably the wrong equipment costs more. You can probably buy the right equipment for less money. So we want to talk about that. Because my pilot, he's a smart guy, and knows what's going on. He said the government is using the wrong equipment and instituting a massive, multibillion-dollar project, but they're using the wrong type of equipment. So let's find out about that.We want the traveling public to have the greatest customer service, with an absolute minimum of delays and with great convenience all at the lowest possible cost. We want to help you realize these goals, and we will indeed help you realize these goals. Airports are very important when you travel. Very important. As an example, some of you were saying yesterday to me that you go to China, you go to Japan, they have fast trains all over the place. We dont have one. I dont want to compete with your business -- (laughter) -- but we dont have one fast train. And it's the same thing with our airports. Our airports used to be the best. Now they're at the bottom of the rung. We've spent $6 trillion -- think of it -- as of about two months ago, $6 trillion in the Middle East. We've got nothing. We've got nothing. We never even kept just even a little tiny oil well. Not one little one. I said, keep the oil. But we've spent right now $6 trillion in the Middle East. We have nothing. And we have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports, we have obsolete trains. We have bad roads. We're going to change all of that, folks. You're going to be so happy with Trump. I think you already are.So we want to help you realize these goals by rolling back burdensome regulations. And you people are regulated probably as much as almost anybody, although I can think of a couple of industries that are even worse. Lowering the overall tax burden on American businesses big league. That's coming along very well. Way ahead of schedule, I believe. And we're going to be announcing something, I would say, over the next two or three weeks that will be phenomenal in terms of tax, and developing our aviation infrastructure.  Again, I want to thank you all for being here. So I want this to be a meeting of substance. I want to be able to do things for you. The auto industry was in. They left, they said it was the best meeting they've ever had. I even took them into the Oval Office. The head of Ford, the head of General Motors, the head of Fiat, others -- they never saw the Oval Office. I said, you mean they never took you in? You see how far away it was from the room? Ten feet. It was 10 feet across the hallway, but they never got taken in. I took them in. The auto companies are going to be making massive investments in Michigan and Ohio, in Pennsylvania, a lot of the places where jobs have left. So were really happy about that. Theyve been great. Ford is going to build -- you know they cancelled a big plant in a certain place, I wont say where -- a $2 billion plant, and theyre building it in the United States and theyre expanding greatly. General Motors the same thing. Theyve been great. Theyve been great. I think theyll continue to be great.But were also going to be great to them. Were going to get rid of a lot of unnecessary regulation, and were going to make their life a lot easier. Theyre going to employ a lot more people. So a lot of businesses are rushing in. Theyre coming in big league.So with that, I thought what I would do is perhaps well start with Mr. Gray. Well go around the room and just quickly just say who you are and who you represent. The biggest of the airlines are here. STAFFER: Thank you, press.THE PRESIDENT: And you can -- no, stay, stay, stay. Let them see whos here. (Laughter.) Everyone is so quick to get rid of the press. I think I am the most open President ever. (Laughter.) They want to get rid of the press. What, you dont want to see who Mr. Gray is? (Laughter.) Maybe I should have started with somebody else. (Laughter.) Okay, you can stay. Yeah, stay. Stay for a while. See whos here, right? Okay, good.MR. GRAY: Well, thank you, Mr. President. Im Myron Gray, and I represent the United Parcel Service. MS. EVENS: Im Ginger Evens, Im the Commissioner of Aviation for the city of Chicago.MR. FLYNN: Mr. President, Bill Flynn with Atlas Air.MR. WIGINGTON: Rob Wigington, CEO for Nashville Airport Authority.MR. CALIO: Nick Calio, Airlines for America. Thank you for having us.MR. BASTIAN: Mr. President, Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Airlines.THE PRESIDENT: Great. Welcome. Delta is doing well. MR. BASTIAN: Doing great, and you know weve been neighbors for a long time. THE PRESIDENT: Thats right. Thats right, good. MR. BASTIAN: Hopefully we've been good to you.THE PRESIDENT: You've been very good. Thank you. MR. HAYES: Mr. President, Robin Hayes, CEO of JetBlue Airways. (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: Good job.MR. BRONCZEK: Mr. President, Dave Bronczek, FedEx.THE PRESIDENT: By the way, Fred Smith was here yesterday.MR. BRONCZEK: Yes, I know.THE PRESIDENT: He's a great, great guy.MR. KELLY: Gary Kelly, Southwest Airlines.THE PRESIDENT: Great job. MR. TILDEN: Brad Tilden, Alaska Air Group. And were actually in the process of merging with Virgin America right now.THE PRESIDENT: Okay, good.MR. FOYE: Mr. President, Pat Foye, Executive Director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. THE PRESIDENT: Great. We spoke a long time ago.MR. FOYE: Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT: And you did a good job.MR. FOYE: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Appreciate it.MR. POTTER: Mr. President, Jack Potter, Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. MR. BURKE: Mr. President, Kevin Burke. Im the President of Airports Council International-North America, which is every airports in the United States and Canada. Thank you for having us. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.MR. VANECEK: Mr. President, Bill Vanecek. I'm the Director of Aviation for the Buffalo Niagara International Airport and Niagara Falls International Airport. I'm also the chairman of Airports Council International-NA.THE PRESIDENT: Great. MR. LOPANO: Mr. President, good morning. My name is Joe Lopano. Im from Tampa International Airport. MR. MUOZ: Oscar Muoz with United Airlines. And Mr. Doug Parker from American couldnt be here today.THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Thank you.MS. FLINT: Good morning, Mr. President. Deborah Flint, the CEO of Los Angeles World Airports. LAX is the worlds seventh largest airport and the countrys third largest airport.THE PRESIDENT: Well make it number one worldwide. Lets make it number one. (Laughter.) I didnt like the number. What is number one now in terms of service?MS. FLINT: Atlanta.THE PRESIDENT: Thats good. We love the state of Georgia. I love Georgia -- I tell you thats for sure. So thats good.PARTICIPANT: Number one in the world.THE PRESIDENT: So let me ask you -- so what can we do to make your airlines better, to make your balance sheet better, to have you get more jobs and create more jobs, to have you win competition worldwide so you can start doing more business worldwide? Because I know you have a lot of competition, and a lot of that competition is subsidized by governments, big league. Ive heard that complaint from different people in this room. Probably about one hour after I got elected I was inundated with calls from your industry, and many other industries, because its a pretty unfair situation.What can we do? Give me suggestions that we can make your life easier and that you can employ a lot more people.MR. KELLY: Well, Mr. President, I'll lead this off.THE PRESIDENT: Southwest Airlines. MR. KELLY: Thank you very much for the opportunity to be here. We have never had a meeting like this, certainly in my years at Southwest Airlines. So were very grateful for this opportunity. THE PRESIDENT: I want to congratulate you because you have done an amazing job, really amazing job. You really have. So congratulations. Go ahead.MR. KELLY: I think were very well aligned with your philosophy. We would welcome tax reform. We would welcome regulatory reform. And very well aligned on the need for infrastructure investment. The single biggest opportunity for aviation is to modernize the air traffic control system. We work very well with our partners in the airports around the table. I know them all and we serve all of these airports and --THE PRESIDENT: You shouldn't know them too well. (Laughter.) MR. KELLY: Well, theyre our landlords. (Laughter.) (Inaudible) the only landlord available. But we have billions of dollars worth of airport projects underway around the country to continue to modernize the airports. We've spent billions of dollars on the air traffic control modernization but its not making any meaningful progress.THE PRESIDENT: I hear that. I hear we have the wrong system. Im hearing that the United States government -- and is the gentleman whos the head of the FAA right now not a pilot? Or is that -- does he --MR. KELLY: I dont know if hes a pilot or not.THE PRESIDENT: Id like to find out because I think it maybe would be good to have a pilot, like a really good pilot who knows whats going on. Ive heard that, and, I don't know, it seems a little hard to believe because the complexity of your business is right up there, right?MR. KELLY: Oh, very much so.THE PRESIDENT: And I would think you need a very sophisticated person in that job, and somebody that, frankly -- being a pilot would be helpful, because Im hearing you put the wrong -- I hear the government contracted this system thats the wrong system, and I hear that from pilots. So who would be better to tell me? But I hear were spending billions and billions of dollars. Its a system thats totally out of whack. Its way over budget, its way beyond schedule, and when its completed, its not going to be a good system. Other than that, its okay. (Laughter.)So what do you think about that, Gary?MR. KELLY: Well, I agree with you. When you have a project that takes that long, it becomes outdated.THE PRESIDENT: Its already outdated.MR. KELLY: Its already outdated, no question. And we spent billions of dollars on this.THE PRESIDENT: Has that been you or the government or both?PARTICIPANT: Oh no, this is the federal -- FAA, air traffic control --THE PRESIDENT: So when you say we -- we the government --MR. KELLY: Youre paying for it. Youre ultimately -- the airlines and our customers are paying for it.THE PRESIDENT: Why do the airlines allow that to happen where they put in a bad system? Not even antiquated -- and its antiquated because its taken so long. Why do the airlines allow a system that you know is bad from the beginning -- because you guys are pros -- why do they allow the government to put in the wrong system?MR. KELLY: Well, were not in control. And I think thats one of the things that we see as the path to having success, is we need to address the fundamental organization of the air traffic organization, not the safety and regulatory oversight -- thats a government function that needs to remain. But we believe that reforming the FAA by creating a non-for-profit corporation is the way to address the governments that youre speaking to, as well as the long-term financing.THE PRESIDENT: Headed by the airlines? Headed by who? The board would be who?MR. KELLY: The board would be represented by all the various constituents. So the government would have a seat, general aviation would have a seat, certainly the commercial airlines would have a seat. Everyone would --THE PRESIDENT: Well, this wouldnt have happened then. You wouldnt be putting in a system -- a control system -- that is obsolete before they even signed the contract. And, by the way, overly expensive. More expensive than (inaudible). MR. KELLY: You know, the interesting thing is I think that there is absolutely unanimous agreement that the system needs to be modernized and that it is well behind schedule. There is not agreement on the path forward to address that, and thats where we run into roadblocks. We want the government out of managing the air traffic control system so that it can be adequately managed, adequately financed, and we can get this done. We won World War II in three-and-a-half years; we ought to be able to modernize air traffic control.THE PRESIDENT: So how long would it take to -- because Im hearing you have to scrap all of the billions of dollars that have been put in -- stupidly put in. How long would it take to come up with a great air traffic control system, the top anywhere in the world, the top of the line? How long would that take to do and how much would it cost?MR. KELLY: The good news is, we dont have to scrap everything. We are still using fundamentally World War II-era ground-based radar to guide the aircraft from a navigation standpoint. We are not utilizing GPS satellite-delivered navigational tools. Those things exist. At least for Southwest Airlines, we have fully equipped all of our fleet to take advantage of that, but were not getting those kinds of flight profiles written for each airport or each route.THE PRESIDENT: So you'd save a lot of time, you'd save a tremendous amount of fuel.MR. KELLY: We think that we're losing $25 billion a year as an industry. And I think the best example we can offer up to you -- the system is very safe, by the way. And our air traffic controllers are very fine men and women, and they do a fantastic job.THE PRESIDENT: It's safe but it's very cautious. And it should be cautious.MR. KELLY: Yes, it must be cautious.THE PRESIDENT: But I notice the intervals when planes go out seem very, very long.MR. KELLY: It used to be a 55-minute trip between Washington and New York, and today it's 80. PARTICIPANT: Mr. President, it's not just about fuel -- it's about jobs. The partnership in New York City did a study that the cost of air traffic control congestion in New York and New Jersey alone is $75 billion over a period ending in 2028. Those are jobs that haven't been created and jobs that --THE PRESIDENT: And what is the reason for that?PARTICIPANT: It's the antiquated system, one, Mr. President. It's, two, the fact that New York/New Jersey is the busiest airspace in the world. And, three, frankly, that other countries, including Canada, have more efficient systems. Implementation and the funding NextGen is really critical. And this is not an act of (inaudible) -- this is about jobs.PARTICIPANT: Sir, you asked why -- your question -- how did we let this happen to some degree.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah.PARTICIPANT: I've (inaudible) on telecom and railroads and some (inaudible) industry, and it's unfortunate that every time you go from one industry to the other, the regulatory burden continues or gets worse. So in this particular case, to be very frank and blunt, and to your point earlier, I think it's become political -- it's a political process, and so it's difficult for us to have control.THE PRESIDENT: Not anymore it's not political. We're going to get --PARTICIPANT: And you have the appointees that you -- THE PRESIDENT: -- at a reasonable price. So not anymore. Go ahead.PARTICIPANT: I would take special care in reappointing the (inaudible) on the FAA. Whether or not it needs to be a pilot or not, I can't opine, but it would be nice to have people that actually have a thorough understanding of the business of aviation.THE PRESIDENT: Is the head of the FAA a pilot? Does anybody know? Somebody should know. PARTICIPANT: He's not.THE PRESIDENT: He's not? He's not a pilot. I just think a non-pilot would not know the sophistication of this system, right? I mean, better to have a pilot -- because my pilot said it's a terrible system that they're installing; that the work they're doing now is a waste of tremendous amounts of money because the system is a bad system. That's coming from a pilot. PARTICIPANT: Mr. President, when you talk about jobs, and you just recently asked about that, what we talked about just recently with the airlines is infrastructure in the sky, which is really antiquated. But you refer to infrastructure on the ground, the airports.THE PRESIDENT: Both.PARTICIPANT: Yeah, and the airports really are becoming antiquated, to your point. There is a system, there is a charge called a passenger-facility charge, which is a charge that's levied on every ticket. And it hasn't been increased in 16 years, so it's basically defunded. THE PRESIDENT: How much is it?PARTICIPANT: It's $4.50. That could be increased by a simple act of Congress, and it's not a U.S. tax. It's a user fee. So as a customer uses my airport in Tampa, the airlines collect that fee and they send it back to us in Tampa. It never comes to Washington and gets approved in the budget.THE PRESIDENT: The problem is, I don't like raising fees or taxes -- I'll be honest. I mean, we're spending all this money overseas, we're giving away trillions of dollars to all these countries. All of the countries that trade with us are ripping us off. The last thing we have to do is raise the fee. I understand what you're saying, but $4.50 -- it's a lot when you look at all of the passengers. If there were other ways of doing this -- because you're only hurting yourself by -- really, eventually, people are going to just stop flying because it's very expensive with all the taxes. I mean, there are other ways. We're spending so much money overseas, fighting wars, doing things, and, frankly, making horrible trade deals. So don't worry about the money. I'll be able to get the money. The money -- we're going to change things around. END10:07 A.M. EST",20172.4,118.06000000000131,5715.18,32.73000000000047,2307.87,13.199999999999818

123,2017-02-09,Remarks by President Trump at Swearing-In of Attorney General Sessions,"Oval Office11:01 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, everybody, for being here today. It is with great pride, very great pride, that I say these words to you right now: Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Applause.) Welcome to the White House. (Applause.) I want to congratulate you, Jeff, your wife Mary, and your entire family. Jeff Sessions has been a federal prosecutor at the highest level and at the most respected level, a state attorney general, and then a U.S. senator for two decades. He has devoted his life to the cause of justice and believes deeply that all people are equals in the eyes of the law -- and very importantly for Jeff and for so many of us, also in the eyes of God.Hes a man of integrity, a man of principle, and a man of total, utter resolve. You just got a little witnessing of that. That resolve is what we need right now. America faces many challenges. We face the menace of rising crime and the threat of deadly terror. And its not getting better, but it will get better very soon. Its going to get a lot better.These dangerous times require a determined attorney general, which is what Jeff is. Jeff understands that the job of attorney general is to serve and protect the people of the United States, and that is exactly what he will do, and do better than anybody else can. Hes trained better for it than anybody else. The level of respect that he has throughout this country as a former prosecutor, not even to mention being a long-time U.S. senator, is absolutely incredible.He will be a great protector of the people. Im signing three executive actions today designed to restore safety in America. These executive actions continue to deliver on my campaign promises. First, Im directing Department of Justice and Homeland Security to undertake all necessary and lawful action to break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth and other people, many other people.Secondly, Im directing Department of Justice to form a task force on reducing violent crime in America. And thirdly, Im directing the Department of Justice to implement a plan to stop crime and crimes of violence against law enforcement officers. Its a shame whats been happening to our great, truly great law enforcement officers. Thats going to stop as of today.Todays ceremony should be seen as a clear message to the gang members and drug dealers terrorizing innocent people. Your day is over. A new era of justice begins, and it begins right now. I want to again thank and congratulate Mary and our new Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. I wish you Gods wisdom and blessings in your journey. Mr. Vice President, would you please conduct the swearing-in. Thank you. Thank you very much for being here, everyone. (Applause.) (The Attorney General is sworn in.)ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS: Mr. President, thank you for this great honor. Its something I never expected would happen in my life, but I do love the Department of Justice. I care about its traditions and its heritage. I had 15 years in that great department, and the honor to lead it now is something that I do not have words to express effectively.There are a lot of things we need to do. First, we need to value and support and encourage the fabulous people who work there. Ive worked with them over the years. I know how good they are, and their talents need to be directed at this nations benefit in a lot of different ways. We have a crime problem. I wish the blip -- I wish the rise that we are seeing in crime in America today were some sort of aberration or a blip. My best judgement, having been involved in criminal law enforcement for many years is that this is a dangerous, permanent trend that places the health and safety of the American people at risk. We will deploy the talents and abilities of the Department of Justice in the most effective way possible to confront this rise in crime and to protect the people of our country.We have an increased threat, since I was a United States attorney, from terrorism. Mr. President, youve spoken firmly on that. Youve led this nation to say were going to respond effectively to the threat of terrorism, and you can count on your Department of Justice to do so in an effective way. And youve said something that I believe and I think the American people believe -- that we need a lawful system of immigration; one that serves the interests of the people of the United States. Thats not wrong, thats not immoral, thats not indecent. We admit a million people a year plus, lawfully, and we need to end this lawlessness that threatens the public safety, pulls down wages of working Americans. It is an honor beyond words to serve under you and your leadership. Youre putting together a great Cabinet, which is just a thrill for me to have the opportunity to join. And I look forward to making sure that every ounce of strength I have and that the people of the Department of Justice have is going to be focused on preserving and protecting the Constitution and the safety of this country. We will defend the laws of this country as passed by Congress. We will defend the lawful orders of the President of the United States with vigor and determination. Thank you all for being here, I see a lot of good friends, and may God bless all our efforts. Thank you. (Applause.) END11:07 A.M.

124,2017-02-09,Background Press Call on Prime Minister Abe's Visit to the White House,"BACKGROUND PRESS CALLBY SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALSON PRIME MINISTER ABE'S VISIT TO THE WHITE HOUSEVia Telephone12:04 P.M. ESTSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Hi. Todays briefing will be on background. You may quote the official as a senior administration official. With that, I will turn it over to our senior administration official.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Great. Thanks, and hi, everyone. So just before we get started with Q and A, Ill just say a couple words. I think that in the first few weeks of the Trump administration, you can see the importance that President Trump has placed on our alliances in the Asia Pacific. Alliances, in his view, are central to our security and prosperity. At the end of the day, America is great because of our alliances, and the U.S. recognizes that we have tremendous interests across the region. The President has already spoken to several of his counterparts across the region, including Japan and Korea, Australia and New Zealand. I joined Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis on his first trip as Secretary of Defense to Korea, as well as to Japan last week, and Secretary Mattis words and deeds, I think, really went a long way toward reassuring our allies that we stand with them, shoulder to shoulder, 100 percent, and that were seeking to strengthen what are already longstanding and major and important alliances. So its really in that light that Prime Minister Abe is visiting, arriving tonight in Washington for a visit thats going to stretch into the weekend. He is only the second head of state to visit President Trump since his inauguration.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Minor clarification. Minor clarification. Wouldnt he be more properly described as a head of government?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thank you -- because of the emperor. So, and he is also -- or is it because of the Queen actually, in the UK?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, right, exactly. And Theresa May is head of government and -- right.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I hear you. So its not the first time that hes met Prime Minister Abe. Prime Minister Abe was the first leader to (inaudible) President Trump after the election. Theyve had already a number of conversations, and I think that that really makes clear the importance that the President is placing on that relationship and on the U.S. role in the Asia Pacific region.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: All right, are you ready for questions?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay. Lets open it up.Q  Hello? Hey, sorry, the operator was talking, I couldnt hear. Its Margaret Talev with Bloomberg. Thanks for doing the call.First of all, just hoping you can walk us through his schedule. What time is the news conference? Whats happening tomorrow versus Saturday, yadda yadda? I also am wondering if you can address -- do you expect any deliverables and/or any reportable developments on nuclear power, on high-speed rail, or on anything bilateral trade-ish, TPP-ish?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right, okay. So I think youre going to get the precise schedule through my colleague's office. So I'm not going to go into extreme detail just out of fear of giving you bad --SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: To clarify that, you'll get it through main press. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: But just some of the highlights -- the Prime Minister and his delegation are going to meet with President Trump in the Oval Office tomorrow. They are going to have a conversation that's going to cover a very wide range of subjects dealing with the bilateral relationship, the security piece of the relationship, as well as the economic, and also talking about matters of mutual interest regionally and globally as well.After that, there is going to be a working lunch. It will be a slightly larger grouping of people. And that lunch will probably delve more deeply into the economic piece of the relationship. And from there, the President and the Prime Minister are going to travel down to Palm Beach, where the Prime Minister and his wife will be guests of President Trump for the weekend. And I imagine that there will be a fair bit of golf involved, as well as more time together eating and just relaxing really down at Mar-a-Lago. Q  News conference?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: The second part in terms of deliverables -- I'll leave it to the Japanese to talk in more concrete terms about what might be announced in the way of concrete deliverables on the economic side. But I can tell you that the U.S. and Japan represent together 30 percent of the world's GDP. We share an interest in sustaining a strong global economy, ensuring financial stability, and ensuring job growth in both countries. And Prime Minister Abe is well acquainted with President Trump's priorities, which you could sum up in three words -- jobs, jobs, jobs -- when it comes to the economic relationship. And so I think that they'll have pretty in-depth discussions about the overall relationship as well as reaffirming the interest in seeing a free and rules-based trading order in the region. But I'll leave it to you and your colleagues in the press to extract from the Japanese any concrete deliverables that might come.Q  My question is about whether the Senkaku Islands will be on the agenda and whether President Trump, given his track record of being willing to break from previous U.S. policy, would be considering taking a different position on the sovereignty of the Senkakus, particularly in light of his effort to create leverage in negotiations with China.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Got it. Brian, good to hear your voice. So on the Senkakus, the standing U.S. policy has been that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Article 5 of that treaty does apply to the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea, which we recognize as being administered by Japan. That certainly is the Trump administrations policy, as well. And I can -- I would expect certainly for you to hear on that subject and in fairly concrete terms that President Trump is committed to that treaty and it extending. We oppose any unilateral actions that would seek to undermine Japans administration of the islands. As for the question of sovereignty, that is really something that I would not expect to see addressed in this visit.Q  Thanks for doing the call. I wanted to get a question on color that shapes how Prime Minister Abe became the recipient of this sort of informal summit, the first of this President, how that came about, and whether or not that means that the President will have more sort of unfettered time to talk about issues in a sort of different context than he would in the White House.And then I didn't hear you address whether there would be a news conference -- to Margarets question. And just lastly on the question of trade, kind of dovetailing with what Brian was asking with respect to China, are there things on the agenda that would allow the Trump administration to move forward with the Japanese on any sort of bilateral trade agreement that would supplant TPP?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Got it. Okay, so in terms of color about how this summit came about, I think that it was a natural result of the foundation that was laid before the inauguration with Prime Minister Abes early visit. And it was the natural result of the Presidents belief that our alliances are central to our success, both in terms of security and prosperity in the region. As to whether there will be other meetings that follow a sort of -- a casual format, or what you call unfettered time together, I wouldnt be surprised if that was the case. The President does have a -- believes in getting to know leaders that he knows hes going to be spending a lot of time dealing with. And on relationships that are important to him, he believes he can get the measure of the people through more informal settings. And so I imagine that hell make use of time outside of Washington, D.C., with leaders from time to time.As for a news conference, my colleague can confirm, but, yes, there will be a press conference tomorrow after the -- I believe its after the meeting in the Oval Office.And on trade discussions, the President I think has made pretty clear that he believes that bilateral agreements are really the way to go for the United States, that in a bilateral agreement you can negotiate terms that are more favorable to the United States than you can negotiate in a multilateral agreement, where sometimes youre held to the standard of the weakest link in the compact.So Im not going to get ahead of discussions tomorrow to see where discussions go. But I think that this is a first -- its really a first summit since theyve come into office, so theyre going to be talking on a pretty wide range of subjects and certainly touching on possible paths forward with relation to the overall economic relationship. But well leave it at that.Q  Thank you so much for the call, guys. And thank you for giving me an opportunity to ask a question. What I wanted to ask you is, there is a certain attempt to forge closer ties between Japan and Russia. There has been recently a meeting between President Putin and Prime Minister Abe. And we see a general -- I dont know if I want to use the word rapprochement between the two countries -- well, certainly something like that is taking place. I wanted to ask you -- does the Trump administration have any objections to that? Or do you encourage that? How do you view those bilateral attempts between Russia and Japan? Thank you.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Thanks very much. We certainly understand that Japan, as a neighbor of Russia, puts high importance on its own bilateral relations with Russia. And the United States respects that and isnt seeking to interfere with Prime Minister Abes priorities in his dealings with Russia. But Ill leave it to Prime Minister Abe and his government to talk in detail about that bilateral relationship.Q  I wanted to ask if you had any specific item that the President is expected to push Prime Minister Abe on. For example, currency manipulation does seem to be a subject of those around him that has been stressed throughout TPP negotiations from the Republican side. Thank you.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I mean, the Presidents comments the other day about currency manipulation werent the first comments hes made about his views on that subject. I think that over the course of a long weekend together, the two leaders are going to cover a pretty broad range of subjects. I dont think thats necessarily a -- I can tell you thats not something thats at the top of the list, but whether it comes up naturally in conversation, well see over the course of that meeting.Q  Hi, this is Kyle Cardine from Fuji TV. First, I wanted to ask, yesterday Sean Spicer said he would take the question in regards to who was paying for Prime Minister Abes visit to Mar-a-Lago. And also we have one more from our bureau chief. Q  Hi, the President the other day said that Japan is sending hundreds of thousands of cars with big ships, but U.S. cannot sell its cars in Japan. But, in fact, there's no importing tax in Japan, and also the Japanese car manufacturing companies are creating a lot of jobs here in the United States. How do you respond to this kind of Japanese government opinion?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm sorry, the line went a little fuzzy just at the end of your bureau chief's question. I'm sorry, if you could repeat that.Q  My question is, the President said the U.S. cannot sell its own cars in Japan, but, in fact, there's no importing tax in Japan for U.S. cars. And also, the Japanese car manufacturing companies are creating a lot of jobs here in the United States because they are producing most of the cars in the U.S. How do you respond to this kind of Japanese government opinion? Thank you.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Right. Okay, so on who's paying for the visit, I'd defer to Sean Spicer to get back to you on that, since I'm not directly involved with the logistics. I'm sure that whatever arrangement was made --SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can address that. The visit to Mar-a-Lago is a personal gift of -- I dont know exactly how we're phrasing it, but it's something that the President is doing for the Prime Minister.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Got it. And on your second one, I would really -- what I'd like to do is defer to my colleague who's actually working on the economic piece in more detail than I am on this visit. And he's not on the line, so my excuse to dodge the question -- the import tax. But automobiles is certainly going to be an important topic of conversation in both directions, because it's such an iconic and critical part of the Japanese economy. It's of high interest to President Trump. And I'm sure that that will come up in discussion.Q  Hey, it's Olivier Knox at Yahoo! News. I have a couple for you. The first one is, unless I missed it, the President has not yet spoken to Xi Jinping. Is there, beyond the sort of symbolic importance of this, are you sending a deliberate message by doing that? And then, specifically for you, what's the President's position in terms of North Korea in terms of a six-party-like approach or unilateral pressure?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So in terms of -- you're right that the President Trump has not spoken with President Xi Jinping. The two have exchanged letters. Xi Jinping had sent a congratulatory letter on the day of the President's inauguration. And President Trump yesterday sent a letter to Xi Jinping really to wish President Xi and the people of China a happy Lantern Festival -- the Lantern Festival is on Saturday. I recommend you going and getting those soup dumplings somewhere in the D.C. area -- (laughter) -- which is fun to do. And, of course, a prosperous and healthy year of the rooster, as well. The President, in his note to Xi Jinping, stated that he believes that having a constructive relationship with China would be something that would serve the fundamental interests of both of our countries and really the region in the world more widely, and that he does look forward to discussing matters of mutual cooperation, as well as delving into some of the well-known differences in the relationship. So they are in contact.To your second question about six-party talks and the like, I'd say that it's right now premature to detail a North Korea strategy on the part of the Trump administration. And in time we'll have more that we'll be prepared to say about that. Japan and the United States both strongly urge North Korea not to take provocative acts. And, of course, were they to do so, that would be information that would feed into and inform a Trump administration approach to the DPRK.Q  The Japanese Ive spoken with since the campaign have obviously been quite nervous about some of the rhetoric that they heard from the President back on the campaign trail about paying more for the bases and wouldnt mind perhaps if Japan and South Korea built their own nuclear weapons. What is -- how is the President going to assure Prime Minister Abe that the United States truly has its back and that theres no need for the Japanese to worry that the United States isnt going to be there for its defense?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. I think the way hell do it is both in words and in actions, and those words and actions are already taking place. Secretary of Defense Mattis, who the President had asked to visit the region, made very clear statements about the strength of the alliance, that these alliances and our commitment to them are unwavering and really the cornerstone of prosperity, security and freedom in the Asia Pacific region.So I think that youre going to hear similar messages from the President himself. And I think that that will go a long way towards dispelling any doubts that may still remain, or Japanese and Korean and friends and other friends and allies throughout the region.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Okay. Thank you for doing that. Thanks, everybody, for joining. We appreciate it. END12:30 P.M. EST",20172.4,118.06000000000131,5715.18,32.73000000000047,2307.87,13.199999999999818

130,2017-02-10,Remarks by the Vice President at a Swearing-in Ceremony for Secretary Price,"Vice Presidents Ceremonial Office11:27 A.M. ESTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Good morning. On behalf of President Donald Trump, it will be my great privilege today to administer the oath of office to Americas new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price. (Applause.)We're grateful to be joined by colleagues and friends to mark this important occasion in the life of our administration and no less extent in the life of this nation. The American people can be proud of having the finest health care in the world. But we all have known the challenges in recent years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.President Trump has made it the top priority of this new Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with health care reform that will lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government. And finding someone to lead Health and Human Services who brings a background in medicine, a background in health care, a background in budgetary issues in the Congress of the United States, who understands the unique challenges of state officials in programs like Medicaid was easily met when he made the decision to name Dr. Tom Price as the new Secretary of Health and Human Services.Dr. Price is uniquely qualified to step into this leading role during this time of reform in the life of health care in America. For nearly 20 years, Tom Price worked in private practice as an orthopedic surgeon in the Atlanta area, mending broken bones, giving people the hope and the health to lead lives to the fullest. You passed on your wisdom by training rising generations of physicians at a local college and hospital -- an impressive career in health care.But your patients werent the only ones that benefitted by your leadership and by your example. You would carry your leadership qualities into the Georgia State Senate where you served for eight years, becoming the majority leader of the Georgia State Senate, and helping to steer a time of real reform and renewal in the state of Georgia.Then it was on to Congress where I first met Dr. Price. He would serve in the Congress now for more than 12 years -- chairman of the Budget Committee, but without question emerging as the most principled expert on health care policy in the House of Representatives, if not the entire Congress.And now President Trump has transformed you with leading the Department of Health and Human Services on behalf of the American people. And as Secretary, we're both confident that you will bring that experience as a physician, that experience at the state level, and that singular experience at the national level to ensure that President Trumps vision for a health care system in this country that works for every American will become a reality in the years ahead.So with that, on behalf of President Trump, is it my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office. (The oath is administered.) (Applause.)END 11:31 A.M. EST",20269.37,96.96999999999753,5734.13,18.949999999999818,2316.1,8.230000000000018

132,2017-02-10,Remarks by President Trump and Prime Minister Abe of Japan in Joint Press Conference ,"East Room1:08 P.M. ESTPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Prime Minister Abe, on behalf of the American people, I welcome you to the very famous White House. You honor us with your presence. This is one of our earliest visits from a foreign leader, and I am truly glad that it could be from such an important and steadfast ally.The bond between our two nations, and the friendship between our two peoples, runs very, very deep. This administration is committed to bringing those ties even closer. We are committed to the security of Japan and all areas under its administrative control, and to further strengthening our very crucial alliance.The U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of peace and stability in the Pacific region. It is important that both Japan and the United States continue to invest very heavily in the alliance to build up our defense and our defensive capabilities, which, under our mutual leadership, will become stronger and stronger, and, as time goes by, ultimately they will be impenetrable. We face numerous challenges, and bilateral cooperation is essential. Our country is committed to being an active and fully engaged partner. We will work together to promote our shared interests, of which we have many in the region, including freedom from navigation and of navigation, and defending against the North Korean missile and nuclear threat, both of which I consider a very, very high priority.On the economy, we will seek a trading relationship that is free, fair and reciprocal, benefitting both of our countries. The vibrant exchange between us is a true blessing. Japan is a proud nation with a rich history and culture, and the American people have profound respect for your country and its traditions. I also want to take this opportunity, Mr. Prime Minister, to thank you and the people of Japan for hosting our armed forces.Working together, our two countries have the ability to bring greater harmony, stability and prosperity to the Pacific region and beyond, improving countless lives in the process. We are committed to that goal -- highly committed. Prime Minister Abe, on behalf of the United States of America, I thank you for being with us today. We will soon be traveling to the great state of Florida, where I know we will have a long and very successful talk, negotiations, and a very, very productive weekend.Mr. Prime Minister.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) This is the fourth time in six months for me to visit the United States. The last time was in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii at the end of last year. I am indeed sincerely grateful for the always heartwarming welcome accorded to me by the American people. I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to President Trump. Donald, you must have been very busy in this very important period of 100 days after your inauguration. And thank you very much for inviting me over to the White House. My name is Abe, but in the United States some people mistakenly pronounce my name as ""Abe."" But that is not bad, because even in Japan everybody knows the name of that great President, that a farmer and carpenter's son can become a President. And that fact, 150 years ago, surprised the Japanese, who were still under the shogunate rule. The Japanese opened their eyes to democracy. The United States is the champion of democracy.Donald, President, you are excellent businessman, but you have never been in the Congress or been a governor. You have not experienced being in the public office. But you have fought the uphill struggle and fight for more than a year in the election campaign to become a new President. And this is the dynamism of democracy. I would like to celebrate and congratulate Donald being sworn in as the President. The United States is a country having the largest number of chances, opportunities in the world. That has always been the case right now, as well as going forward. This will never change. And that is the reason why automotive industries and other Japanese businesses have built factories all over the United States, to engage in local production here. Last year, from Japan to the United States, there have been more than $150 billion of new investment being made into the United States. And those Japanese businesses have created a large number of jobs. The mutually beneficial economic relations have been built by Japan and the United States. With President Trump taking on the leadership, I'm sure there will be -- major-scale infrastructure investment will be made, including the fast-speed train. Those of you who have rode on the Japanese Shinkansen, I'm sure you would appreciate the speed, the comfort and safety with the latest maglev technology. From Washington, D.C. to New York, where Trump Tower exists, only one hour would it take if you ride the maglev train from Washington, D.C. to New York. Japan, with our high level of technical capability, we will be able to contribute to President Trump's growth strategy. There will be even more new jobs being born in the United States.And to further deepen these bilateral economic relations between Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence, there will be a cross-sectoral dialogue to be held. And we have agreed on this. And furthermore, in Asia Pacific, where we see dramatic growth to expand free trade and investment, this will be a big chance for both Japan and the United States. But, of course, it must be done in a fair manner. Never should a state-owned company, backed by state capital, should not make any economic intervention. Free ride on intellectual property should not be condoned. In Asia Pacific region, with Japan and U.S. taking on the leadership to create free and fair market based upon rules, should be built. I and President Trump have confirmed on our strong will to do so. The cornerstone of peace and prosperity in Asia Pacific, that is the strong Japan-U.S. alliance. And this is unwavering ties between our two countries. I and President Trump will work together to further strengthen our alliance. We have shared this strong resolve. As we see increasingly difficult security environment, we have confirmed that U.S.-Japan Security Pact Article 5 will be applied to Senkaku Islands. The United States will strengthen its presence in the region. And under the banner of the proactive contribution to peace, Japan will play a greater role. At the same time, we will maintain the deterrence and also to proceed on reducing the impact we had fought through on the realignment of the U.S. forces in Japan.And Henoko's -- relocation to Henoko of the impasse Futenma is the only solution. And Japan and U.S. will continue to work closely on this.On North Korea, we would strongly demand North Korea to abandon nuclear and ballistic missile program, and not to make any more provocations. And we have completely agreed on the importance of the early solution for the abduction issue in East China Sea, South China Sea, and Indian Ocean -- everywhere we need to maintain the freedom of navigation and rule of law. And such international order there must be maintained.Japan and United States have confirmed that we will strongly protest any use of force, as well as coercion to change the status quo. I and the President will address not only bilateral but regional issues. And we have had a very frank exchange of views on the peace and prosperity of the world that we should contribute, for any form of terrorism should be strongly condemned. And we will cooperate in our fight against terrorism. Japan will, of course, exercise a commensurate role in this regard. And furthermore, the regional conflict of the refugees, of poverty and infectious diseases -- there are many challenges faced by the world, which will be a serious issue to threaten the peace and stability for Japan as well as the United States.But Japan and the United States and the international community must work hand in hand in order to solve these questions. Of course, there are disagreements, but we should not close down dialogue just by pointing to the differences and ignoring the common interests and common goals. We need to have dialogue because there are disagreements. What we mostly desire -- what is most desired by those who are challenging the existing international order is to just focus on differences. We should not close the dialogue of Japan -- have for four years that I have consistently followed through on our foreign policy. Now, whatever the challenge and difficulty ahead of us, I and Trump -- President Trump will continue our dialogue to seek shared solutions. And after lunch, I am looking forward for a weekend in Florida with Donald. We will play golf together. My scores in golf is not up to the level of Donald at all, but my policy is never up, never in, always aiming for the cup -- never cut to just the goal with shortcuts and short chops. Those are the words never found in my dictionary. (Laughter.)But in a relaxed atmosphere, I hope to take time to discuss with Donald on the future of the world, future of the region, and future of Japan and the United States. Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Well take a few questions, unless you dont want to ask any questions, if thats possible. Maybe well start -- where is Daniel Halper, New York Post? Daniel. Q  Thank you, Mr. President. Im curious about yesterdays ruling in the 9th Circuit Court. Has it caused you to rethink your use of executive power? And how will you respond? And will you sign new executive orders and perhaps a new travel ban?And, Mr. Prime Minister, Im curious about your reaction to Americas withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP. Do you think that thats weakened Americas position in Asia? And how do you think -- how do you envision any sort of trade deal with the President working out?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, your question was unrelated to what were here for today, but Ill answer it. We are going to keep our country safe, we are going to do whatever is necessary to keep our country safe. We had a decision which we think well be very successful with. It shouldnt have taken this much time because safety is a primary reason. One of the reasons Im standing here today is the security of our country. The voters felt that I would give it the best security. So well be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country. Youll be seeing that sometime next week.In addition, we will continue to go through the court process, and ultimately I have no doubt that well win that particular case.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) Now, in the world, we are also facing the issues of the refugees and terrorism. We need to work closely together on these global issues. Japan have always played our own role, but going forward, we will continue to work with the international community to execute our responsibility in a commensurate manner. And each of our country has immigration control scheme, as well as policy on immigration, as well as refugees. These are to do with domestic affairs of that country, so I would refrain from making any comments.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Okay. Blake Berman, Fox. Blake Berman.Q  Thank you, Mr. President. Id like to pick up where Daniel left off, if you dont mind. You said earlier this week -- and Im quoting for you -- you said, ""Ive learned a lot in the last two weeks, and terrorism is a far greater threat than the people of our country understand, but were going to take care of it."" Based off of what you have learned, and now knowing that your executive order is at least temporarily on hold, do you still feel as confident now as you have been at any point, that you and the administration will be able to protect the homeland?And, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you. I would just like to pick off again on what Daniel had asked about TPP. Do you feel its a mistake that the United States has at least signaled its intention to withdraw from the deal? Thank you, both.PRESIDENT TRUMP: I feel totally confident that we will have tremendous security for the people of the United States. We will be extreme vetting, which is a term that I developed early in my campaign because I saw what was happening. And while Ive been President, which is just for a very short period of time, Ive learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely, President. And there are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen, I can tell you that right now. We will not allow that to happen. So well be going forward. Well be doing things to continue to make our country safe. It will happen rapidly. And we will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people. We will allow lots of people into our country that will love our people and do good for our country. Its always going to be that way, at least during my administration, I can tell you that.PRIME MINISTER ABE: (As interpreted.) On TPP -- oh, of course, we are fully aware of President Trumps decision. On economic issues, we will be discussing at the working lunch to follow. As for Japan and United States, trade and investment, as well as economic relations, how can we develop and grow our relationship. As I have already mentioned, Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Vice President Pence will create a new framework for dialogue, and I am quite optimistic that the good results will be seen from the dialogue.Now, for the free and fair common set of rules to be created for the free trade regime in the region, and that was the purpose of TPP, and that importance have not changed. I, myself, believe that.Q  (As interpreted.) Thank you. My name is Hara from NHK. I have a question to Prime Minister Abe. Now, for the automotive market in Japan, as well as foreign exchange of Japan, in the prior remarks there have been discrepancy in your positions. So at the summit meeting, what were the discussions?  And were you able to narrow down the gap?And President Trump had said that he will make the United States a great country. What is meant by the great country? And, Prime Minister, what do you mean when you say United States is a great ally for you?PRIME MINISTER ABE: Now with the birth of the Trump administration, a new genesis will be built between Japan and U.S. in economic relations. In order to put forward such strong message, I have proposed to launch a new framework for economic dialogue, and we were able to agree on this.As for sectoral discussions, we will be having a discussion at our working lunch. In any case, between President Trump and I, myself, on Japan and U.S. economic relations, we will -- we have already agreed that we will have Vice President Pence and Deputy Prime Minister Aso to discuss fully on the economic relations between our two countries. And we are looking forward for the good results to ensue from the debate between the experts. As for the foreign exchange, we will have -- Secretary of Treasury and the Minister of Finance will continue the close communication.For the United States to become a great nation, the various roles played by the United States and the responsibility to go with it, the world over is faced with increasing uncertainty. That United States will become a great America and become a great and strong ally would be good for Japan. And for Japan and U.S. alliance to be further strengthened would be good not only for our two nations, but also contribute to the peace and prosperity of the Asia Pacific and United States to become even greater. We will welcome that.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you. I will say that -- and you've seen it -- ever since I won the election and became President-elect, Ive been telling companies, car companies and other companies -- many companies: Come back into the United States. And they've been coming back in. And big announcements are going to be made over the next short period of time. Some of you already know what those announcements are.We lost a lot of our factories, a lot of our plants. And those factories and those plants will be coming back. And jobs will be coming back to Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and North Carolina, and so many other places where we've lost so many jobs. And those are the people that were so good to me, and now Im being good to them. So we've had a tremendous number of announcements. We've had Ford and General Motors and many, many others -- Intel yesterday made a major announcement. And they did that because of what is happening with our tax structure, which is going along very well. And well be having some very big news over the next short period of time.But we are a nation of tremendous potential. And the expression Make America Great Again, I will tell you -- and I will add very strongly and with great assurance, it will be greater than ever before.And I just want to thank the Prime Minister for a friendship. We developed a great friendship when we met in New York City, at Trump Tower. We spoke for a long, long period of time. And when I greeted him today at the car, I was saying -- I shook hands, but I grabbed him and hugged him because that's the way we feel. We have a very, very good bond -- very, very good chemistry. Ill let you know if it changes, but I don't think it will. (Laughter.) So I just want to thank the Prime Minister for being here. We're going to be meeting your wife in a very short period of time, and I look very much forward to that. And I want to thank everybody in the room. We're going to have a tremendous relationship, long-term relationship of mutual benefit with Japan.Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. PRIME MINISTER ABE: One more.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yes, certainly. Go ahead.Q  (As interpreted.) Thank you very much. From Sankei Shimbun, my name is Takita. I have a question to President Trump. Obama administration, under the rebalance to Asia, have emphasized Asia. But China is taking hardline stance in South China Sea, as well as China Sea. And North Korea has went on with the missiles and nuclear development. So some countries in Asia are concerned over commitment of United States in Asia. So against this backdrop, as was mentioned earlier, for the Trump administration, for the situations in Asia, how would you respond to the increasing difficulty here?And, President, you have repeatedly stated about China taking on the currency -- foreign exchange policies which are not good for the United States. Do you think that eventually it will change in the future?PRESIDENT TRUMP: I had a very, very good conversation, as most of you know, yesterday with the President of China. It was a very, very warm conversation. I think we are on the process of getting along very well. And I think that will also be very much of a benefit to Japan. So we had a very, very good talk last night and discussed a lot of subjects. It was a long talk. And we are working on that as we speak. We have conversations with various representatives of China, I believe, that that will all work out very well for everybody -- China, Japan, the United States, and everybody in the region.As far as the currency devaluations, Ive been complaining about that for a long time. And I believe that we will all eventually -- and probably very much sooner than a lot of people understand or think -- we will be all at a level playing field, because that's the only way its fair. That's the only way that you can fairly compete in trade and other things. And we will be on that field, and we will all be working very hard to do great for our country. But it has to be fair. And we will make it fair. I think the United States is going to be an even bigger player than it is right now, by a lot, when it comes to trade.  A lot of that will have to do with our tax policy, which youll be seeing in the not-too-distant future. Well have an incentive-based policy much more so than we have right now. Right now we don't even know -- nobody knows what policy we have. But we're going to have a very much incentive-based policy. We're working with Congress, working with Paul Ryan, working with Mitch McConnell. And I think people are going to be very, very impressed.We're also working very much -- and this has a lot to do with business -- on health care, where we can get great health care for our country at a much-reduced price, both to the people receiving the health care and to our country. Because our country is paying so much, and Obamacare, as you know, is a total and complete disaster. So were going to end up with tremendous health care at a lower price. And I think people are going to be extremely happy. Difficult process, but once we get going -- and, as you know, Tom Price was just approved a few hours ago. So we finally have our Secretary, and now we get down to the final strokes.Again, I want to thank everybody for being here. I want to thank Mr. Prime Minister. What an honor, what a great honor it is. And lets go to Florida. (Applause.) END1:37 P.M. EST",20269.37,96.96999999999753,5734.13,18.949999999999818,2316.1,8.230000000000018

These calls were to facilitate a smooth transition and begin to build the necessary relationships between the President, his advisors and foreign leaders. Such calls are standard practice in any transition of this magnitude.Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology.Throughout my over thirty three years of honorable military service, and my tenure as the National Security Advisor, I have always performed my duties with the utmost of integrity and honesty to those I have served, to include the President of the United States.I am tendering my resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way.I am also extremely honored to have served President Trump, who in just three weeks, has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America's leadership position in the world.As I step away once again from serving my nation in this current capacity, I wish to thank President Trump for his personal loyalty, the friendship of those who I worked with throughout the hard fought campaign, the challenging period of transition, and during the early days of his presidency.I know with the strong leadership of President Donald J.

142,2017-02-13,Joint Statement from President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau,"President Donald J. Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held their first official meeting today in Washington, D.C. and affirmed their longstanding commitment to close cooperation in addressing both the challenges facing our two countries and problems around the world.No two countries share deeper or broader relations than Canada and the United States. We are bound together by our history, our values, our economy, our environment, and our resolve to improve the lives of our citizens. Our close relationship and ongoing collaboration allow us to successfully meet any challenges we may face over the coming years, and to build a prosperous future for the people of both countries.Neighbors in Growing our EconomiesWe recognize our profound shared economic interests, and will work tirelessly to provide growth and jobs for both countries. Canada is the most important foreign market for thirty-five U.S. States, and more than $2 billion in two-way trade flows across our shared border every day. Millions of American and Canadian middle-class jobs, including in the manufacturing sector, depend on our partnership. We affirm the importance of building on this existing strong foundation for trade and investment and further deepening our relationship, with the common goal of strengthening the middle class.The United States and Canada also recognize the importance of cooperation to promote economic growth, provide benefits to our consumers and businesses, and advance free and fair trade. We will continue our dialogue on regulatory issues and pursue shared regulatory outcomes that are business-friendly, reduce costs, and increase economic efficiency without compromising health, safety, and environmental standards. We will work together regarding labor mobility in various economic sectors.Given our shared focus on infrastructure investments, we will encourage opportunities for companies in both countries to create jobs through those investments. In particular, we look forward to the expeditious completion of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, which will serve as a vital economic link between our two countries.Energy Security and EnvironmentU.S.-Canada energy and environmental cooperation are inextricably linked, and we commit to further improving our ties in those areas. We have built the worlds largest energy trading relationship. We share the goals of energy security, a robust and secure energy grid, and a strong and resilient energy infrastructure that contributes to energy efficiency in both countries. We collaborate closely on energy innovation, particularly in the clean energy sphere. As the process continues for the Keystone XL pipeline, we remain committed to moving forward on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment.We also look forward to building on our many areas of environmental cooperation, particularly along our border and at the Great Lakes, and we will continue to work together to enhance the quality of our air and water.Partners in Keeping our Border SecureWe recognize the security of our borders as a top priority. Together, we address security at our shared border and throughout our two countries, while expediting legitimate and vital cross-border trade and travel. We demonstrate daily that security and efficiency go hand-in-hand, and we are building a 21st century border through initiatives such as pre-clearance of people and integrated cross-border law enforcement operations. In addition, our two countries are committed to a coordinated entry-exit information system so that records of land and air entries into one country establish exit records for the other.Recognizing the success of pre-clearance operations for travelers, we commit to establishing pre-clearance operations for cargo. We intend to accelerate the completion of pre-clearance for additional cities and continue to expand this program. Not only will these efforts enhance efficiency at our shared border, they will also strengthen our shared security. In the spirit of a more efficient and secure border, we will also examine ways to further integrate our border operations, including analysis of the feasibility of co-locating border officials in common processing facilities.Because we share a strong concern about the increase in opioid-related deaths, our countries will work together on common solutions to protect our people from opioid trafficking.Given the integrated nature of the infrastructure that supports our intertwined economies, cyber threats to either country can affect the other. We therefore commit to further cooperation to enhance critical infrastructure security, cyber incident management, public awareness, private sector engagement, and capacity building initiatives.Allies in the WorldWe are indispensable allies in the defense of North America and other parts of the world, through NATO and other multilateral efforts. Our troops have time and again fought together and sacrificed their lives for our shared values. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) illustrates the strength of our mutual commitment. United States and Canadian forces jointly conduct aerospace warning, aerospace control, and maritime warning in defense of North America. We will work to modernize and broaden our NORAD Partnership in these key domains, as well as in cyber and space.The United States welcomes Canadas recently announced decision to launch an open and transparent competition to replace its legacy fleet of CF-18 fighter aircraft. The United States also welcomes Canadas decision to explore the immediate acquisition of 18 new Super Hornet aircraft as an interim capability to supplement the CF-18s until the permanent replacement is ready. Canada appreciates the cooperation of the United States to facilitate these processes.The United States values Canadas military contributions, including in the Global Coalition to Counter-ISIS and in Latvia. Together, we are harnessing all elements of national power to achieve the goal of degrading and destroying ISIS through our military operations to deny it safe havens and to build the capacity of local partners, stop the flow of foreign terrorist fighters into the Middle East region, cut off access to financing and funding, counter the ISIS narrative, and support the stabilization of communities liberated from ISIS.Empowering Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders It is a priority of both countries to ensure equal opportunities for women in the workforce. We are committed to removing barriers to womens participation in the business community and supporting women as they advance through it. As part of this effort, we are creating a United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. We expect this initiative to promote the growth of women-owned enterprises and to further contribute to our overall economic growth and competitiveness, as well as the enhanced integration of our economies.The Way ForwardWe share a commitment to continue to strengthen our ties for the benefit of our mutual prosperity and security. We look forward to our cabinets following up on todays meeting with further discussions in their respective areas of responsibility. Our countries deserve our full commitment to increased economic growth, which we will deliver.

145,2017-02-13,Remarks by President Trump and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada in Joint Press Conference,"East Room2:16 P.M. ESTPRESIDENT TRUMP: Prime Minister Trudeau, on behalf of all Americans, I thank you for being with us today. It is my honor to host such a great friend, neighbor, and ally at the White House, a very special place. This year, Canada celebrates the 150th year of Confederation. For Americans, this is one of the many milestones in our friendship, and we look forward -- very much forward, I must say -- to many more to come.Our two nations share much more than a border. We share the same values. We share the love, and a truly great love, of freedom. And we share a collective defense. American and Canadian troops have gone to battle together, fought wars together, and forged the special bonds that come when two nations have shed their blood together -- which we have.In these dangerous times, it is more important than ever that we continue to strengthen our vital alliance. The United States is deeply grateful for Canadas contribution to the counter-ISIS effort. Thank you. And we continue to work in common, and in common cause, against terrorism, and work in common cooperation toward reciprocal trade and shared growth.We understand that both of our countries are stronger when we join forces in matters of international commerce. Having more jobs and trade right here in North America is better for both the United States and is also much better for Canada. We should coordinate closely -- and we will coordinate closely -- to protect jobs in our hemisphere and keep wealth on our continent, and to keep everyone safe.Prime Minister, I pledge to work with you in pursuit of our many shared interests. This includes a stronger trading relationship between the United States and Canada. It includes safe, efficient, and responsible cross-border travel and migration. And it includes close partnership on domestic and international security.America is deeply fortunate to have a neighbor like Canada. We have before us the opportunity to build even more bridges, and bridges of cooperation and bridges of commerce. Both of us are committed to bringing greater prosperity and opportunity to our people.We just had a very productive meeting with women business leaders from the United States and Canada, where we discussed how to secure everything that we know the full power of women can do better than anybody else. We know that. I just want to say, Mr. Prime Minister, that I'm focused and you're focused on the important role women play in our economies. We must work to address the barriers faced by women and women entrepreneurs, including access to capital, access to markets, and, very importantly, access to networks.In our discussion today we will focus on improving the ways our government and our governments together can benefit citizens of both the United States and Canada, and, in so doing, advance the greater peace and stability of the world.Mr. Prime Minister, I look forward to working closely with you to build upon our very historic friendship. There are incredible possibilities for us to pursue, Canada and the United States together. Again, thank you for joining us, and I know our discussions will be very, very productive for the future of both countries.Mr. Prime Minister.PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: Thank you, Mr. President. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you very much for joining us. I'd first like to start by extending my sincere thanks to President Trump for inviting me down to Washington. Any day I get to visit our southern neighbors is a good day in my book, particularly when it's so nice and warm compared to what it is back home. We are suffering under a significant winter storm that's hitting our Atlantic provinces particularly harsh, so I just want to send everyone back at home my thoughts as they shovel out, and impress on everyone to stay safe.(As interpreted from French.) The President and myself have had a very productive first meeting today. We had the opportunity to get to know one another better, and, more importantly, we had the opportunity to talk about the unique relationship between Canada and the United States.(In English.) Ends on both sides of the 49th parallel have understood that the bond between our nations is a special one. No other neighbors in the entire world are as fundamentally linked as we are. We've fought in conflict zones together, negotiated environmental treaties together, including 1991's historic Air Quality Agreement. And we've entered into groundbreaking economic partnerships that have created good jobs for both of our peoples.Canadians and Americans alike share a common history as well as people-to-people ties that make us completely and totally integrated. Our workers are connected by trade, transportation and cross-border commerce. Our communities rely on each other for security, stability and economic prosperity. Our families have long lived together and worked together. We know that, more often than not, our victories are shared. And just as we celebrate together, so too do we suffer loss and heartbreak together.Through it all, the foundational pillar upon which our relationship is built is one of mutual respect. And that's a good thing, because as we know, relationships between neighbors are pretty complex and we won't always agree on everything. But because of our deep, abiding respect for one another, we're able to successfully navigate those complexities and still remain the closest of allies and friends. Make no mistake -- at the end of the day, Canada and the U.S. will always remain each other's most essential partner.And today's conversations have served to reinforce how important that is for both Canadians and Americans. As we know, 35 U.S. states list Canada as their largest export market, and our economies benefit from the over $2 billion in two-way trade that takes place every single day. Millions of good, middle-class jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership. Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and we're going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead.(As interpreted from French.)

Millions of good, middle-class jobs on both sides of the border depend on this crucial partnership. Maintaining strong economic ties is vital to our mutual success, and were going to continue to work closely together over the coming years so that Canadian and American families can get ahead.(In English.) I'd like to highlight just a few of the specifics that President Trump and I discussed today. At the end of the day, the President and I share a common goal. We both want to make sure that hardworking folks can go to work at a good job, put food on the table for their families, and save up to take a vacation every once in a while. Thats what were trying to do here.Today, we reiterated that our nations are committed to collaborating on energy infrastructure projects that will create jobs while respecting the environment. And, as we know, investing in infrastructure is a great way to create the kind of economic growth that our countries so desperately need. In that same vein, we know that ensuring equal opportunities for women in the workforce is essential for growing the economy and maintaining American and Canadian competitiveness on the world stage. As such, the President and I have agreed to the creation of the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders. This initiative is more than just about dollars and cents. This is about ensuring that women have access to the same opportunities as men, and prioritizing the support and empowerment of women who are senior business leaders and entrepreneurs. In doing so, well grow the Canadian and American economies, and help our businesses prosper.(As interpreted from French.) Finally, President Trump and myself have agreed to work together to fight against the traffic of opioids across our border. The rise of illegal use of opioids in our society is nothing less than a tragedy. We will do everything we can to ensure the safety of Canadians and Americans. Ladies and gentlemen, President Trump: I know that if our countries continue to work together, our people will greatly benefit from this cooperation. (In English.) History has demonstrated time and again that in order to tackle our most pressing issues, both foreign and domestic, we must work with our closest allies, learn from each other, and stand in solidarity as a united voice.With a level of economic and social integration that is unmatched on the world stage, Canada and the United States will forever be a model example of how to be good neighbors. Winston Churchill once said, That long Canadian frontier from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans, guarded only by neighborly respect and honorable obligations, is an example to every country, and a pattern for the future of the world. That, my friends, is the very essence of the Canada-U.S. relationship.I look forward to working with President Trump over the coming years to nurture and build upon this historic partnership. Once again, its a tremendous pleasure to be here in Washington. Merci beaucoup. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Okay, well take a couple of questions. Scott Thuman. Scott. Q  Thank you, Mr. President. You just spoke about the desire to build bridges, although there are some notable and philosophical differences between yourself and Prime Minister Trudeau. Im curious, as you move forward on issues from trade to terrorism, how do you see this relationship playing out? And are there any specific areas with which during your conversations today you each decided to perhaps alter or amend your stances already on those sensitive issues like terrorism and immigration?And, Prime Minister Trudeau, while only in its infancy so far, how do you see this relationship compared to that under the Obama administration?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, we just began discussions. We are going to have a great relationship with Canada, maybe as good or better, hopefully, than ever before. We have some wonderful ideas on immigration. We have some, I think, very strong, very tough ideas on the tremendous problem that we have with terrorism. And I think when we put them all together, which will be very, very quickly -- we have a group of very talented people -- we will see some very, very obvious results. We're also doing some cross-border things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster for trade.We have -- through technology, we have some really great ideas, and theyll be implemented fairly quickly.PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: One of the things we spoke about was the fact that security and immigration need to work very well together. And certainly Canada has emphasized security as we look towards improving our immigration system and remaining true to the values that we have. And we had a very strong and fruitful discussion on exactly that.Theres plenty that we can draw on each other from in terms of how we move forward with a very similar goal, which is to create free, open societies that keep our citizens safe. And that's certainly something that we're very much in agreement on.Tonda MacCharles.Q  Good afternoon, Mr. President and Mr. Prime Minister. And, Mr. Prime Minister, could you answer in English and French for us, please?A little bit of a follow-on on my American colleagues question. President Trump, you seem to suggest that Syrian refugees are a Trojan horse for potential terrorism, while the Prime Minister hugs refugees and welcomes them with open arms. So Id like to know, are you confident the northern border is secure?PRESIDENT TRUMP: You can never be totally confident. But through the incredible efforts -- already I see it happening -- of formerly General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, we have really done a great job. We're actually taking people that are criminals -- very, very hardened criminals in some cases, with a tremendous track record of abuse and problems -- and we're getting them out. And that's what I said I would do. Im just doing what I said I would do when we won by a very, very large Electoral College vote.And I knew that was going to happen. I knew this is what people were wanting. And that wasnt the only reason, that wasnt my only thing that we did so well on. But that was something was very important. And I said we will get the criminals out, the drug lords, the gang members. We're getting them out.General Kelly, who is sitting right here, is doing a fantastic job. And I said at the beginning we are going to get the bad ones -- the really bad ones, we're getting them out. And that's exactly what we're doing.I think that in the end everyone is going to be extremely happy. And I will tell you right now, a lot of people are very, very happy right now.PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: Canada has always understood that keeping Canadians safe is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any government. And that's certainly something that we're very much focused on. At the same time, we continue to pursue our policies of openness towards immigration, refugees, without compromising security. And part of the reason we have been successful in doing that over the past year -- welcoming close to 40,000 Syrian refugees -- is because we have been coordinating with our allies, the United States and around the world, to demonstrate that security comes very seriously to us. And that's something that we continue to deal with.(As interpreted from French.) It is clear that if you want to have a healthy and secure society or safe society, you have to make sure that you maintain -- that you focus on security. And we have welcomed refugees from Syria. We have been very successful, but we have always taken our responsibility toward security very seriously. And our allies, including the United States, understand this focus very well. And they have done so since the very beginning.PRESIDENT TRUMP:  Caitlin Collins (ph), please.Q  Thank you. President Trump, now that you've been in office and received intelligence briefings for nearly one month, what do you see as the most important national security matters facing us? And, Prime Minister Trudeau, you've made very clear that Canada has an open-door policy for Syrian refugees. Do you believe that President Trumps moratorium on immigration has merit on national security grounds?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Okay. Thank you. Many, many problems. When I was campaigning, I said its not a good situation. Now that I see it -- including with our intelligence briefings -- we have problems that a lot of people have no idea how bad they are, how serious they are, not only internationally, but when you come right here.Obviously, North Korea is a big, big problem, and we will deal with that very strongly. We have problems all over the Middle East. We have problems just about every corner of the globe, no matter where you look. I had a great meeting this weekend with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and got to know each other very, very well -- extended weekend, really. We were with each other for long periods of time, and our staffs and representatives. But on the home front, we have to create borders. We have to let people that can love our country in, and I want to do that. We want to have a big, beautiful, open door, and we want people to come in and come in our country. But we cannot let the wrong people in, and I will not allow that to happen during this administration. And people -- citizens of our country want that, and that's their attitude, too. I will tell you, we are getting such praise for our stance, and it's a stance of common sense -- maybe a certain toughness, but it's really more than toughness, it's a stance of common sense -- and we are going to pursue it vigorously. And we don't want to have our country have the kinds of problems that you're witnessing taking place not only here but all over the world. We won't stand for it. We won't put up with it. We're just not going to let it happen. We're going to give ourselves every bit of chance so that things go well for the United States. And they will go well. Thank you.PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: Canada and the United States have been neighbors a long time, and Canadians and Americans have stood together, worked together at home and around the world. We've fought and died together in battlefields in World War I and World War II, in Korea, in Afghanistan. But there have been times where we have differed in our approaches, and that's always been done firmly and respectfully.The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves. My role and our responsibility is to continue to govern in such a way that reflects Canadians' approach and be a positive example in the world.Richard Latendresse. Q  Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. I'll ask my question in French first and then, for you, I'll -- again in English. (As interpreted from French.) Mr. Prime Minister, if I heard you correctly, you said that Canadian businesses, Canadian workers are concerned for their businesses and for their work and jobs concerning the renegotiation of NAFTA. So what guarantees did you get from this government that we will keep our jobs and our businesses in the renegotiation of NAFTA?(In English.) Mr. President, again, during the last three months, you have denounced NAFTA. You have talked over and over about the Mexican portion of the agreement, very little about the Canadian one. My question is in two short part is, is Canada a fair trader? And when you talk about changes to NAFTA concerning Canada, are you talking about big changes or small changes? Thank you.PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: (As interpreted.) First of all, Richard, thank you for your question. It is a real concern for many Canadians because we know that our economy is very dependent on our bonds, our relationship with the United States. Goods and services do cross the border each way every single day, and this means a lot of millions of jobs for Canadians, and good jobs for Canadians. So we are always focusing on these jobs, but there are also good jobs, millions of jobs, in the United States that depend on those relationships between our two countries.So when we sit down as we did today, and as our teams will be doing in the weeks and months to come, we will be talking about how we can continue to create good jobs for our citizens on both sides of the border. And during this exercise, we continue to understand that we have to allow this free flow of goods and services, and we have to be aware of the integration of our economies, which is extremely positive for both our countries. And this is the focus that we will have in the coming weeks and months to come.(In English.) Canadians are rightly aware of the fact that much of our economy depends on good working relationships with the United States, a good integration with the American economy. And the fact is, millions of good jobs on both sides of the border depend on the smooth and easy flow of goods and services and people back and forth across our border. And both President Trump and I got elected on commitments to support the middle class, to work hard for people who need a real shot at success. And we know that by working together, by ensuring the continued effective integration of our two economies, we are going to be creating greater opportunities for middle-class Canadians and Americans now and well into the future.PRESIDENT TRUMP: I agree with that 100 percent. We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada. Well be tweaking it. Well be doing certain things that are going to benefit both of our countries. Its a much less severe situation than whats taking place on the southern border. On the southern border, for many, many years, the transaction was not fair to the United States. It was an extremely unfair transaction. Were going to work with Mexico, were going to make it a fair deal for both parties. I think that were going to get along very well with Mexico; they understand and we understand.You probably have noticed that Ford is making billions of dollars of new investments in this country. You saw Intel the other day announce that because of what Ive been doing and what Im doing in terms of regulation -- lowering taxes, et cetera -- theyre coming in with billions and billions of dollars of investment, and thousands of thousands of jobs. General Motors, likewise, is expanding plants and going to build new plants. Fiat Chrysler was at a meeting where theyre doing the same. Jack Ma -- we have so many people that want to come into the United States. Its actually very exciting. I think its going to be a very exciting period of time for the United States and for the workers of the United States, because they have been truly the forgotten man and forgotten women. Its not going to be forgotten anymore, believe me.So our relationship with Canada is outstanding, and were going to work together to make it even better. And as far as the southern border is concerned, were going to get that worked out. Were going to make it fair, but we are going to make it so that everybody is happy. Its very important to me. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. (Applause.) END2:42 P.M. EST",20412.16,142.79000000000087,5763.96,29.829999999999927,2328.25,12.150000000000091

The participants in the meeting from Canada included Minister of Public Safety Ralph Goodale, Minister of Finance William Morneau, Minister of Transport Marc Garneau, and Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan. The Vice President was joined by Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly, Acting Deputy Secretary of State Tom Shannon, and members of the Vice President's staff. The Vice President emphasized the importance of the U.S. bilateral relationship with Canada and underscored the need to deepen our cooperation on issues related to trade and investment, border security, and the fight against global terrorism, including the counter-ISIS campaign. The Vice President also discussed the U.S. government's continuing commitment to NATO, and he and the Canadian ministers discussed their expectations for the Munich Security Conference later this week, where he will be traveling to engage with a wide range of NATO allies on issues related to European security.

147,2017-02-13,Remarks by President Trump and Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada in Roundtable with Women Entrepreneurs,"Cabinet Room12:13 P.M. ESTPRESIDENT TRUMP: I'm honored to be here with Prime Minister Trudeau, whose father I knew and respected greatly. And he gave me a picture of myself and your father, and what a great picture. I will keep that in very special place -- at the Waldorf Astoria, together. We're going to launch the Canada-United States Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs. We have some of the great ones in this room -- and business leaders. We have so many great women leaders around the table today, and we're going to go through your names exactly, because many of you I know, some of you I dont, so I want to find out all about you. Women, as you know, I can say that from my past life, I had so many women executives who were phenomenal -- phenomenal -- and really helped me a great deal in business. So it was really fantastic. They play a tremendously important role, women in our economy. Women are the primary source of income in 40 percent of American households and households with children under the age of 18. In order to create economic growth and lots of very good, well-paying jobs, we must ensure that our economy is a place where women can work and thrive. And I think that's happening in the United States much more so, and Ivanka is very much involved in this. And I appreciate you being involved in it. And I know, Justin, in Canada it's happening big league, and it's very important. We need policies that help to keep women in the workforce and to address the unique barriers faced by female entrepreneurs -- and they are unique. We need to make it easier for women to manage the demands of having both a job and a family, and we also need to make it easier for women entrepreneurs to get access to capital. And I guess pretty much all entrepreneurs, we have to help them out, because the system is not working so well for entrepreneurs getting capital. But it's in particular difficult for women, so we're going to get access to markets and access to networks. And I look forward to hearing your advice. We're going to go around the table, and I want to really learn something today. And again, it's a great honor to be with you. And, Justin, I can say on behalf of our country, it's an honor to be with you.PRIME MINISTER TRUDEAU: Thank you, Donald, for welcoming us. And Im really excited about launching this, sitting around the table here with a number of successful executives who just happen to be women. One of the things that Ive been lucky enough to do over the past year in New York and Beijing and across Canada is sit down with women CEOs, women executives to talk about both their successes and the challenges theyre facing that are particular, but also how, of course, we create more paths to success for women across our community and across our society.Whenever I sit down with a woman executive, I know that she has had to overcome significant barriers that exist, and therefore is likely to have greater insight into how to help reduce those barriers for others, but also be a formidable contributor to the success of business and her economy.So I think for me, its not just about doing the right thing, its about understanding that women in leadership positions is a very powerful leverage for success, for business, for communities, and for our entire economy. (Speaks in French.)Its a great pleasure to sit with you now and to hear from your extraordinary leadership. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you, Mr. Prime Minister. So how about we start with Ivanka, we go around the room. Ivanka, you might just want to say a couple of words.MS. TRUMP: Welcome. Im honored to be here, and really looking forward to hearing from each of you who serve as tremendous role models for me and so many other business leaders. (Inaudible) our countries can lend some tremendously valuable perspective as we think about the unique challenges that entrepreneurs, women in the workforce, female small-business owners are confronted with each and every day. And as we think about how we level the playing field for this generation and for the next.So thank you for being here. And I look forward to hearing from you today.MR. FARRELL: Thank you. Im Dawn Farrell and Im from a company called TransAlta, which is located in Alberta, where you're going to build the Keystone Pipeline.PRESIDENT TRUMP: A big chunk of it, thats right.MS. FARRELL: So thanks for the opportunity to contribute to this important dialogue, and a dialogue that weve had for 100 -- over hundreds of years. My company is in the business of making electricity. We generate electricity from coal, natural gas, and also from renewable sources -- wind, hydro and solar. We have operations in Canada, the United States and in Australia. And, really, for us to excel, we have to be excellent at operations, engineering, finance and trading, and we have to excel in the public policy dialogue that happens around energy. And Ill talk about that as part of today, because weve done some excellent work with the Trudeau government.Now, future jobs in our space absolutely depend on growth. Theres no question of that. And I truly believe for there to be future opportunities for women, we have to have growth, because the more jobs there are, the more opportunities. And collaborations like this where we break down barriers and simplify, and build trust and build confidence -- because I think businesses invest when theres confidence. And my hope is thats what comes out of here. Now, for us, having operations in Canada and the United States makes us absolutely more competitive. Our Centralia operation, which is in Washington State, is one of the most competitive plants. They have twice won our most coveted award for plant of the year. But the reality is, teams of people from the United States and teams of people from Canada cross the border often to work with each other to share and to -- so that we can excel as a company overall. So it's huge --PRESIDENT TRUMP: That's good. Well, we're going to go around. Thank you. Good job. Boy, she did a hell of a job. (Laughter.) Wow, no wonder she's successful. (Laughter.) Monique, thank you.MS. LEROUX: Monique Leroux. I am the chair of the Board of the Quebec Investment Fund and the chair of the Economy Council of the province. I'm also a board member of large, global corporations like S&P Global, Michelin, and Couche-Tard, which is a very interesting Canadian company. Each of those organizations, of course, have significant businesses in the U.S. and also employs a lot of people in this country.I feel really honored and privileged to be part of the council. I would like to thank you for this great opportunity.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you.MS. LEROUX: We have long history of cooperation, and I think that for the woman agenda it will contribute a lot for our great countries. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you, Monique. Appreciate it.MS. LEE: My name is Tina Lee. I'm CEO of T&T Supermarket. We're Canada's largest Asian supermarket chain. I employ 5,000 staff and serve 500,000 people across the country every week.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Wow.

By halting this regulation, the President has removed a costly impediment to American extraction companies helping their workers succeed.President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to reducing the regulatory burdens on everyday Americans, their pocketbooks, and their businesses. He has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated.This is one of many that we've signed, and we have many more left. And we're bringing back jobs big league, we're bringing them back at the plant level; we've bringing them back at the mine level.Many members of Congress were in attendance at todays bill signing, including House Speaker Paul Ryan; Representative Jeb Hensarling, Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee; and other members of the House Financial Services Committee.The Trump Administration is committed to fixing the broken regulatory system, enhancing Americans productivity, and unleashing American potential.",20504.41,92.25,5782.57,18.609999999999673,2337.58,9.329999999999927
153,2017-02-14,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/14/2017, #12","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:15 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. Happy Valentine's Day. I can sense the love in the room. (Laughter.) First off, last night, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control -- OFAC -- labeled the Venezuelan Vice President as a specially designated narcotics trafficker under the Kingpin Act. Before I continue with the briefing and look forward to your questions, I want to turn it over for a short time to newly minted Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, to issue a brief statement on this and deliver a few questions.Secretary Mnuchin.SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Pleasure to be here on my first busy day in office. Yesterday, the Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control, known as OFAC, designated Venezuelan national Tareck El Aissami as a specially designated narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. El Aissami's primary frontman, Venezuelan national Samark Lopez Bellow was also designated.These designations follow a multi-year investigation into El Aissami's criminal activities. And President Trump appreciates the hard work put into this case by the Department of Treasury, the Department of State, as well as the National Security Council and many people throughout law enforcement.Following the signing of the executive order last week designing to break the back of criminal drug cartels, this action demonstrates the President's seriousness about fighting the scourge of drugs in the United States. In addition, he wants to send a clear message to the people of Venezuela that America stands with them. And with that, I'm happy to take two or three questions specifically about this.Q  Secretary Mnuchin, since sanctions are directly relevant, obviously, to the Treasury Department, which is an agency that you now oversee, can you talk a little bit about plans to sanction Russia and if you'll keep Obama-era sanctions against Russia?SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Our current sanctions programs are in place, and I would say sanctions are an important tool that we will continue to look at for various different countries. But it's a very important program within the Treasury Department.Q  And for Russia specifically?SECRETARY MNUCHIN: The existing policies are in place.Q  Mr. Secretary, are you contemplating any additional sanctions against Iran? And can you tell us what you think the bottom line will be at these particular sanctions you announced yesterday and are referring to today with the Venezuelan Vice President? What's it going to mean?SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, first, let me just comment -- again, this is as a result of a very long effort --Q  Did you (inaudible) the implication, by the way?SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Yes, this was underway. This was a very long effort. But the implication is quite significant. We expect that there will be frozen tens of millions of dollars and, again, that sanctions are a very important way of us sending a message that we will not stand for illicit activities, whether they're drug trafficking or terrorism.Q  On Iran, sir?Q  Secretary, including sanctions, what other tools are you looking at?SECRETARY MNUCHIN: I can't comment on all the tools, but, again, let me just reinforce that sanctions are a very important tool within the department and we will use them as appropriate.Q  What about freezing assets?SECRETARY MNUCHIN: In this case, we did freeze assets -- again, as I mentioned, tens of millions of dollars of assets. And that will have a very big impact on this.So I'll take one more question please. Yes, in the back.Q  During the campaign, the President had made comments about Janet Yellen and whether -- basically inferring that she was being too political and that she should be ashamed of herself. Do the folks at the Treasury Department and within the administration feel confident with Mrs. Yellen at the helm and to be able to set monetary policy going forward?SECRETARY MNUCHIN: Well, let me just comment. I'm really here today, again, to talk about the Venezuelan situation. But let me just say that there is a tradition of the Secretary of Treasury having ongoing meetings with the head of the Federal Reserve, and I look forward to that now that I'm in office doing that and spending time with her.Thank you very much, everybody. It's a pleasure to be here on my first day. MR. SPICER: All right, let's get back to the fun. We've been reviewing -- and I want to address the events of last night, first and foremost. We've been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth. We got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, where a level of trust between the President and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change.The President was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the Vice President and others. He was also very concerned in light of sensitive subjects dealt with by that position of national security advisors -- like China, North Korea and the Middle East -- that the President must have complete and unwavering trust for the person in that position.The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the President to ask for General Flynns resignation. Immediately after the Department of Justice notified the White House Counsel of the situation, the White House Counsel briefed the President and a small group of senior advisors. The White House Counsel reviewed and determined that there is not a legal issue, but rather a trust issue.During this process its important to note that the President did not have his Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, who he trusts immensely, approved by the Senate. When the President heard the information as presented by White House Counsel, he instinctively thought that General Flynn did not do anything wrong, and the White House Counsels review corroborated that.It is not ordinary* [unordinary] for an incoming National Security Advisor to speak with his counterparts about the issues of concern to them. In fact, he spoke with over 30 of his counterparts throughout the transition. As Charles Krauthammer said last night, it is perfectly reasonable for him to do so. The issue here was that the President got to the point where General Flynns relationship -- misleading the Vice President and others, or the possibility that he had forgotten critical details of this important conversation had created a critical mass and an unsustainable situation.Thats why the President decided to ask for his resignation, and he got it. The irony of this entire situation is that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia. He continues to raise the issue of Crimea, which the previous administration had allowed to be seized by Russia. His Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, stood before the U.N. Security Council on her first day and strongly denounced the Russian occupation of Crimea. As Ambassador Haley said at the time, the dire situation in Eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions. President Trump has made it very clear that he expects the Russian government to deescalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea. At the same time, he fully expects to and wants to be able to get along with Russia, unlike previous administrations, so that we can solve many problems together facing the world, such as the threat of ISIS and terrorism.The President is currently evaluating a group of very strong candidates that will be considered to fill the National Security Advisor position permanently, and is confident in the ability of General Kellogg, a decorated and distinguished veteran of the United States Army, until that person is ultimately chosen.Before I get into the Presidents schedule for today, a quick recap of the Presidents activity over the last few days, since we havent had the honor of spending so much time together.The President has been keeping a close eye on the Oroville Dam situation in California. Weve worked closely with Doug LaMalfa, who represents Californias First District, where the dam is located, and other state officials to help people who have been impacted. The situation is a textbook example of why we need to pursue a major infrastructure package in Congress. Dams, bridges, roads, and all ports around the county have fallen into disrepair. In order to prevent the next disaster, we will pursue the Presidents vision for an overhaul of our nations crumbling infrastructure.We hope everyone remains safe as the evacuations continue, and well be working alongside with FEMA and appropriate government entities to make sure that we are doing everything we can to attend to this matter. The President was honored also to welcome the Prime Minister of Japan last week from their first official meeting at the White House to their joint press conference at Mar-a-Lago -- excuse me, their joint press conference and their time together at Mar-a-Lago. The President and the Prime Minister had a productive visit that reaffirmed their determination to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance and economic relationship.At Mar-a-Lago, the President was proud to stand behind Prime Minister Abe on Saturday to convey the United States unwavering support for our Japanese allies in the face of North Koreas most recent missile launch. On Sunday, the President met with now-Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin and Mr. Steve Wynn before returning to Washington.Yesterday, the President had an incredibly productive set of meetings and discussions with Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada, focusing on our shared commitment to close cooperation in addressing both the challenges facing our two countries and the problems throughout the world. Our countries share a profound economic interest with more than $2 billion in two-way trade flowing across our border every day. The President was pleased to launch the Canada-United States Council for the Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders by holding a roundtable discussion here at the White House. Together with Prime Minister Trudeau, his daughter Ivanka, the President discussed the unique challenges that women face in the workplace with an incredible group of successful and respected female business executives from both countries. A full list of the participants is available through the pool.In addition to his in-person meetings with the prime ministers of Japan and Canada, the President also recently had phone calls with the presidents of Tunisia, Peru, Nigeria, Colombia and South Africa. Readouts are available on all of those calls.Finally, following the Prime Minister's visit yesterday, the President met with Chairwoman McDaniel and Co-Chairman Paduchik of the Republican National Committee. In the afternoon, the President participated in a pinning ceremony for Major Ricardo Turner, one of his military aides. The aides to the President are mid-grade officers, one from of each of the services. They provide direct support to the President in his role as Commander-in-Chief, and their primary responsibilities are to serve as an emergency action officer, aide-de-camp, and ceremonial aide. It's a longstanding tradition that when the President's military aide is promoted to the next higher grade, the President conducts that promotion. Major Ricardo Turner, the President's military aide, was recently promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and the promotion was held in the Oval Office.The President also spoke yesterday with Maureen Scalia on the one-year anniversary of her husband's passing. The President and Mrs. Scalia discussed her late husband's incredible legacy, and how the President is making every effort to carry it on by nominating Judge Gorsuch, who shares the love of the Constitution, to succeed him on the bench.Last night, the President obviously hosted the swearing-in of Secretary Mnuchin in the Oval Office. Secretary Mnuchin is a world-class financier whose decades of experience with financial and monetary matters make him the ideal person to spearhead the President's plan to develop a dynamic, booming economy that works for all Americans. We're glad to officially have him on board.Now, moving on to the schedule for today -- this morning, the President and newly confirmed Secretary of Education DeVos held a parent-teacher conference meeting with parents and educators from public, private, charter, and home schools this morning. The President opened the meeting by congratulating Secretary DeVos for her toughness and staying the course throughout her confirmation process. He then discussed his vision for all Americans to have an opportunity to climb the ladder of success, starting with making quality education available to every child no matter their zip code.Under the current system, the President believes too many of our children are trapped in failing schools, especially in the African American community. The President told the group to begin addressing this problem, which he views as a civil rights issue. He wants parents to be able to decide what educational options are best for their children. The group launched into a wide-ranging discussion that included public and charter schools, home-schooling, dropout prevention, and the BASIS Schools Program, states' responsibilities, and the current state of the U.S. Department of Education.The President's ultimate goal is to create safe communities, great schools, and well-paying jobs. He believes that each of these goals is linked to the others, and the Trump administration is taking concrete steps to achieve them all.The President also spoke on the phone earlier today with Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom, continuing the productive conversation they started during her visit earlier this year. A readout on that call should be coming soon. The President then had lunch with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and his wife regarding combatting drug use.At 2:00, the President will sign House Joint Resolution 41 in the Oval Office. The resolution is a start of rolling back harmful Obama-era regulations, which have cost the American business consumers a staggering $890 billion, making our companies less competitive and even driving some of them out of business. The American free enterprise system is the greatest engine for economic prosperity in the world, but for too many, to reach its maximum potential, we must remove the barriers to productivity that are holding back our great workers and businesses. Misguided federal regulations, such as the SEC rule addressed by HJR 41, inflict real cost on the American people and put our businesses, especially small businesses, at a significant disadvantage. It's a priority for the Trump administration to fix our broken regulatory system so that it enhances American productivity and wellbeing without imposing unnecessary costs and burdens. Signing this joint resolution is one more step towards achieving this goal.Later this evening, the President will meet with Secretary Kelly and Attorney General Sessions to continue discussions on potential options for addressing the very clear national security threats we're facing in light of the recent Supreme Court ruling.Tomorrow, the President is pleased to be welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House. They will discuss ways to advance and strengthen the special relationship between our two countries and stability in the Middle East. They will consult on a range of issues -- regional issues -- including addressing the threats posed by Iran and its proxies, the crisis in Syria, and countering ISIS and other terrorist groups. As the President has made clear, his administration will work to achieve comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so that Israelis and Palestinians can live in peace and security. The way forward toward that goal will also be discussed between the President and the Prime Minister. They will hold a joint press conference tomorrow, as well, and further guidance will be coming on the time and location. Looking ahead to Friday, the President will travel to Charleston, South Carolina, to attend the rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner. This visit will give the President an opportunity to celebrate a huge milestone for thousands of workers at Boeing, Americas number-one exporter and the millions of American workers involved in aerospace. This trip has been months in the making, and were thrilled to celebrate the rollout of this amazing plane.With that, Id be glad to take some of your questions. Jonathan Karl.Q  Back in January, the President said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch with the Russians. Now, today, can you still say definitively that nobody on the Trump campaign, not even General Flynn, had any contact with the Russians before the election?MR. SPICER: My understanding is that what General Flynn has now expressed is that during the transition period -- well, we were very clear that during the transition period, he did speak with the ambassador --Q  Im talking about during the campaign.MR. SPICER: I dont have any -- theres nothing that would conclude me -- that anything different has changed with respect to that time period.Q  And why would the President -- if he was notified 17 days ago that Flynn had misled the Vice President, other officials here, and that he was a potential threat to blackmail by the Russians, why would he be kept on for almost three weeks?MR. SPICER: Well, thats not -- that assumes a lot of things that are not true. The President was informed of this. He asked the White House Counsel to review the situation. The first matter was whether there was a legal issue. We had to review whether there was a legal issue, which the White House Counsel concluded there was not, as I stated in my comments. This was an act of trust. Whether or not he actually misled the Vice President was the issue, and that was ultimately what led to the President asking for and accepting the resignation of General Flynn. Thats it, pure and simple. It was a matter of trust. We went through a very deliberative process, a very thorough review. The first part of it was clearly to understand the legal aspect of this, and that was simply concluded there was no legal aspect. And then what happened is the President evaluated the trust aspect of it.Major.Q  When the President was asked on Air Force One yesterday -- I mean, on Friday, rather, traveling down to Mar-a-Lago, about reports about conversations with the Russians about sanctions, he said, I dont know about it. Ill look into that. Was he being truthful? MR. SPICER: What he was asked specifically is was he aware of a Washington Post story. He hadnt seen that at the time. Of course, he was involved; I just said that he was aware of the situation right after the White House Counsel informed him back in January.Q  And his inquiry to the White House Counsel was strictly about the legalities involved, not the propriety of the conversations between General Flynn and the Russian ambassador? MR. SPICER: Well, initially, just to be --Q  Do you have any criticism of the merits of those conversations about sanctions before the Trump administration had been inaugurated?MR. SPICER: So just to be clear, the acting Attorney General informed the White House Counsel that they wanted to give a heads up to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he had sent the Vice President out in particular. The White House Counsel informed the President immediately. The President asked him to conduct a review of whether there was a legal situation there. That was immediately determined that there wasnt. That was what the President believed at the time, from what he had been told, and he was proved to be correct.The issue, pure and simple, came down to a matter of trust. And the President concluded that he no longer had the trust of his national security advisor over --Q  But was it proper for the incoming national security advisor, not part of an administration, to be discussing an issue as sensitive as sanctions with the Russian ambassador?MR. SPICER: His job is to discuss issues with his counterparts. I mean, Charles Krauthammer put it perfectly last night -- thats what hes supposed to be doing. I mean, thats his job. We would constantly read out throughout the transition who he was speaking to, how he was getting ready. The President was receiving congratulatory calls from around the world. We would read out the world leader calls. The job of the incoming NSA is to sit down with the counterparts and start that dialogue, and thats exactly what he did. So the question wasnt did he do anything improper or legal, its a question of could he be trusted further. And that trust, or the erosion of that trust, was, frankly, the issue.Q  Did the President instruct him to talk about sanctions with the Russian ambassador?MR. SPICER: No, absolutely not. No, no, no. But that -- no. And theres no -- thats never --Q  So would he have preferred he had not done that?MR. SPICER: Look, I think the President had no problem with the fact that he acted in accord with what his job was supposed to be doing. He had an ability to talk about issues that were important, whether it was that or the 30 other countries that he spoke to. That was part of his job, as has been noted by many people. Thats what the national security advisor and, frankly, other positions do -- they begin the process of preparing their incoming job by talking to counterparts, people who have previously held the job, et cetera. If he had not done that, there would be questions as to whether hes properly prepared on day one. Q  So he (inaudible) one conversation about sanctions.MR. SPICER: No, the issue isnt whether or not -- what he discussed. Theres been a complete legal review of that, and theres no issue with that. The issue is whether or not he failed to properly inform the Vice President -- or not be honest with him, or not remember it.But thats the plain and simple issue. And when he lost trust with the President, thats when the President asked for and received his resignation.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. Yesterday, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the President, said that the President continued to have trust in General Flynn. MR. SPICER: Right.Q  What happened between yesterday morning and yesterday evening that led the President to lose confidence in General Flynn?MR. SPICER: Well, Im not going to get into the specifics of what the Presidents thinking was, but I will just say, as I noted in the opening statement, that it was an evolving and eroding process. And so at the end of the day, the President made a decision, as he does on all subjects, and asked for and received the national security advisors -- but he is one of those people that weve noted before -- when he is ready to make a decision, he makes it, whether its hiring somebody or asking for someones resignation. Once he has determined that hes made a decision on any subject, thats when he informs his staff.So going into the day, it was an evolving situation. He made a determination late in the day, and he executed on it.Yes, Alexis.Q  Hes an extremely loyal person, General Flynn. Was it a difficult decision for the President to let General Flynn go?MR. SPICER: Well, sure. I mean, General Flynn is a dedicated public servant. Hes headed the DIA, he has been an outstanding member of the Army, both as an officer and then as a flag officer. Hes served this country admirably. And I think the President appreciated his service to his nation, his commitment to his campaign, and his service to this country so far.But at some point, the decision came down on whether or not that that trust had eroded. The important matters, as I mentioned, that are before the President when hes dealing with issues of world matters, of all of the issues -- friends and allies, foes, hot spots -- he needs to rely on a national security advisor to give him sage advice. And I think at a certain point, that guidance, that trust, eroded. And the President, as he does on all matters, ultimately decides that when he's ready to make a decision, he executes.Alexis.Q  Sean, two questions. Does the President believe that anything that he discussed with General Flynn during the transition might have been construed by the General as a request or an encouragement to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador? That's question number one.MR. SPICER: So -- oh, we're going to pause. So, on the first, again, as I made clear, there's nothing that the General did that was a violation of any sort. He was well within his duties to discuss issues of common concern between the two countries. I will say it again: What this came down to is a matter of trust. The President was glad that he was out there conducting his job, preparing for his job, going back and forth with his counterparts throughout the world, much as the President had done with all of these world leaders calling the President, congratulating him, looking to set up calls for him once he was inaugurated. Similarly, General Flynn was beginning that process with his counterparts throughout the world. That was never of a concern to the President, from day one that he was briefed from the White House Counsel. The issue, plain and simple, came down to a matter of trust. And once that occurred, it was over.Q  On question number one, just to clarify, the President does not believe that any discussion that might have taken place -- and we know from intel, it did, on sanctions -- creates a problem for the President in any way -- that that is not a problem, that General Flynn discussed sanctions with the Russians?MR. SPICER: No, there is -- I can't say it clearly enough. There was nothing in what General Flynn did, in terms of conducting himself, that was an issue. What it came down to, plain and simple, was him misleading the Vice President and others, and not having a firm grasp on his recollection of that. That's it.Q  Question number two. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill from both sides of the aisle would like to investigate or probe or ask more questions about this. Does the President hope to cooperate with those investigations? Would he instruct members of his staff who worked for him here and in the administration to cooperate with those investigations?MR. SPICER: Well, we're going to comply with the law. I think the President feels very confident the review that was conducted by White House Counsel was very thorough and concluded very conclusively, as he had first come to -- instinctively come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong. So people are free to do what they wish, but I think that they will find exactly what the President first believed and what the White House Counsel concluded. And, frankly, I believe a couple publications even reported that there was no investigation for a reason -- because there was not an issue of law, it was an issue of trust.George.Q  When do you expect to have a replacement in place? And secondly, on another topic, there was a report yesterday that one of your colleagues said the White House is keeping dossiers on reporters. Can you say if that's true or not?MR. SPICER: That is absolutely not true. There are no dossiers being kept. It's just a binder that I put right here, that's about it. That was a joke. Hold on one second. And then, I'm sorry, George, the first part?Q  Timetable on a replacement.MR. SPICER: Just like the way he handled this situation, the President will meet with individuals, and when he's ready to make a decision and he feels as though the person is qualified and can properly advise him on the issue, he'll make that decision. But that, as all decisions, rests with him.I'm just going to go to my first Skype seat. John Huck of WKVVU out of Las Vegas.John.Q  Thank you so much on behalf of our viewers here in Southern Nevada for the opportunity to join you today. As you know, Sean, Las Vegas has suffered terribly in the last recession -- more so than perhaps any other city in the country. As the administration moves forward with repealing financial regulations and possibly rolling back Dodd-Frank, what guarantees can you make to Nevadans that those actions won't lead banks and investments banks to re-engage with the risky financial behaviors that tanked our economy the last time and left taxpayers here on the hook to bail those banks out?MR. SPICER: Thanks, John. I think one of the things -- if you look at the intent of Dodd-Frank, it was to make sure that we didn't have institutions that were too big to fail. And frankly, it has actually created institutions that are now too big to fail. Dodd-Frank actually did exactly the opposite of what it intended to do. And I think when you look at the regulation HJR 41 that the President is signing today, this is another example of the President taking decisive action to roll back regulations that are, frankly, creating more of a burden on our nation's banks and businesses than helping them.I think the President is going to be very clear with making sure that we do things that build up the goal of what Dodd-Frank actually intended to do. But right now, we actually, through Dodd-Frank, put taxpayers more on the hook than we let them off. We've created more institutions and created more guarantees for the federal government to bail out some of these institutions if they exceed their authority.John Roberts.Q  Let me go back to what you said at the beginning. You said the White House Counsel's Office reviewed this and determined that there was nothing illegal. What evidence did they look at in making this determination? And secondly, Democrats up on the Hill say that they want an investigation of this. They're looking into what did the President know and when did he know it. So can you tell us what evidence you looked at the White House Counsel's Office, and what did the President know about all of this and when was he aware of it?MR. SPICER: Well, as I mentioned, the first day that the Department of Justice made White House Counsel available -- or sought to notify White House Counsel was January 26th. The President was immediately informed of the situation. As I said, based on the information that was provided at the time, the view was that this was not a violation. He was proved instinctively correct. And White House Counsel at that time undertook an extensive review both of materials and questioning --Q  Did they --MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into the specifics. What I will tell you is, on multiple occasions they had an exhaustive and extensive questioning of General Flynn on several occasions based on information that was provided to them, or materials that were provided to them to review. I'm not going to get into the details of that, but I will just say that there was an exhaustive review. And again, the thing that's important to note is the Vice President and myself -- in fact, I think the first time I brought this issue up was January 13 -- the Department of Justice didnt notify the White House or the White House Counsel at that time in the transition phase until 13 days later. So I think it's important to understand something very, very important: This idea of why did it take so long -- I think the first question should be, where was the Department of Justice in this. They were aware of this. We were making statements based on what General Flynn was telling us, starting on January 13th. The Vice President went out on the 15th, right? They didnt notify the White House Counsel's Office until January 26th. At that time, there was an immediate -- the President was immediately informed of that and then asked the White House Counsel to conduct a very, very thorough review. The first part of that review was focused on whether or not there was any legal issue -- that's it. Once that became the issue, then there was a -- it shifted into phase two, which is whether or not there was trust still maintained. Then that became a separate set of issues that were --Q  I understand. I'm speaking to the actual evidence, that the FBI has transcripts of these intercepts, which I assume were done by the NSA via a FISA Court order. Was there any communication between the White House Counsel's Office and the FBI? Did those transcripts ever enter --MR. SPICER: I will say that obviously -- there was obviously communication between the Department of Justice and the White House Counsel's Office. I'm not going to get into the specific nature of that. I think it would be inappropriate because of the nature of the information that was being discussed.Yes.Q  Why not dismiss the General on January 27th? Why, if the question was of trust, and immediately you have on the 15th, he's on ""Face the Nation"" saying that -- the Vice President on ""Face the Nation"" saying that this is what General Flynn told me, and then January 26th you hear the opposite -- why not immediately act? Why wait another two and a half weeks?MR. SPICER: I dont understand how that's a due process. Because what the -- the Attorney General didnt come -- the Acting Attorney General -- come in and say that there was an issue. She said, we wanted to give you a head's up that there may be information, okay? She could not confirm there was an investigation. And so it would be unbelievably short-sighted and wrong to go in and dismiss someone immediately. In fact, what the President did was take decisive action to make sure that the White House Counsel thoroughly reviewed and vetted the situation. He took immediate, decisive action. And if you look at the timeline in terms of what he did and how that expanded, the White House Counsel's first and foremost goal was to make sure that there was not a legal issue at hand. Once that was concluded, then it became a phase of determining whether or not the General's action on this and a whole host of other issues undermined his trust in the President. But the President, from day one, from minute one, was unbelievably decisive in asking for and demanding that his White House Counsel and their team review the situation, first and foremost, to question whether it's a legal issue. And what they immediately determined -- not immediately, but within several days, was that, after review, that there was not a legal issue, and then it moved into a second phase.Mara.Q  So wait -- because the President tweeted this morning that the real story is leaks -- illegal leaks.MR. SPICER: It is leaks. But if you think about this -- understand that all of this information was leaked. I mean, I got to -- and again, I know we've got me lecturing you about what the story should be, but I think that there's a real story here. The idea that not just in this administration, but the Obama administration going back to the Bush administration and back, that we have an issue where classified information, of which this would be, is handled in such a way that it is being given out. And I know in some cases it's a good story, and I understand that, and that's to some degree your responsibility to write that. But I think there's also a story here, with the amount of leaks that are coming out of people that are entrusted with national security secrets and classified information are leaking it out. That's a real concern for this President; that when he's talking on the phone with a world leader, that when he's making key decisions that are in the interest of protecting this country, that we have to wonder whether or not people who work for our government, who are entrusted with classified information and decision-based materials are leaking that information out. That, I do believe, is a big story that should be reported. I also believe that the President is, rightly so, very, very concerned about this, because it's not just something that is plaguing the current situation, but it goes back through the Obama administration, the Bush administration, the Clinton administration. When we have government employees that are entrusted with this and then leak it out, that undermines our national security, frankly.Trey.Q  Hold on --MR. SPICER: Sorry, I apologize, Mara.Q  I know you just forgot. I have a question, but I want you to clarify something you just said to John. Are you saying that no one has read the transcripts of the calls, or you just dont want to tell us whether they --MR. SPICER: I said that I'm not going to comment on it.Q  Okay. So my question is about sanctions. You were very specific in talking about the sanctions against Crimea and that he doesnt want to lift them until Crimea is returned. But the sanctions that Flynn was discussing were the sanctions for the election hacking.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  That's something the President could remove on his own if he wanted to. Is he committed to keeping those?MR. SPICER: I think Secretary Mnuchin commented on that. There's no change in our current sanctions strategy with Russia, and I've got nothing for you on that.Trey.Q  Given that the current story is leaks, what is the President willing to do to investigate further to determine where these leaks are coming from?MR. SPICER: Yeah, again, I think this goes back to the same way he negotiates. Telling people what were going to do to cover up additional leaks wouldnt be a very sound strategy when it comes to making sure that that doesnt happen again. The President has been very clear, whether hes negotiating or dealing with an issue like this, you dont telegraph to people how youre going to handle it.Q  Sean --MR. SPICER: Hold on, Trey gets a follow-up. Everyone else got one.Q  So he is going to take some sort of steps to investigate these leaks that the administration --MR. SPICER: I would just say that the President, as I said, is clearly upset about this. He understands the threat that they pose to our national security, and hes going to make sure that he continues to take action to make sure that that stops.Yes.Q  Thank you. So youve mentioned time and time again that this is an issue of trust. You also said that it was an evolving issue, and that the issue of the trust that the President had for Flynn came down to this deception that happened with the Vice President but also a host of whole other -- of other issues. What were the other issues? And was the Vice President the only person that was misled by Flynn? Were other people misled?MR. SPICER: I mean, I think I've stood before you before and explained what General Flynn had conveyed to me. I think there were some others that he had similarly expressed that to, as well. So thats why its others, because it wasnt just people who went out and made public pronouncements and a series of questioning that was rather exhaustive over a long period of time. He continued to maintain that that had not occurred, and I think thats where the President continued to -- and thats why the President was very clear that it was an eroding issue. Because it was after a series of issues and a series of statements and pronouncements that the President came to that conclusion.Q  Were there other issues outside of this call and the deception over that that led to the mistrust with Flynn?MR. SPICER: I think the statement is very clear that it was this and a series of issues. With that, let me go to Jason Stevens of the Federalist Paper in Ashland, Ohio.Q  Thank you. What our readers at the Federalist Papers Project are most interested in is returning the country to the first principles of republican government as understood by the American Founders. One of those principles, in the Declaration of Independence, is the consent of the governed. So my question is this: What are the Presidents future plans for rolling back the expensive and burdensome regulations of the administrative state, most of which are the product of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats who never received the consent of the governed to do anything, let alone make law?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Jason. I think, as I mentioned today, the President, in just a few minutes, is going to be signing HJR 41, which is one of those attempts to roll back some onerous Dodd-Frank regulations with respect to the SEC in particular. He is going to continue -- last week we rolled out another one of those executive orders that ensures that for every new regulation, two must be gotten rid of. The Presidents commitment to rolling back regulation and the overreach of government, I think, is unwavering and unquestionable. So youre going to continue to see this President undo a lot of that government overreach.Jim.Q  Yeah, just a quick question. You said earlier in your comments that the President has been incredibly tough on Russia. How is that possible? He has made comment after comment over the course of the campaign, the transition, where he defended Vladimir Putin. He had an interview with Bill OReilly where he, when he was asked if Vladimir Putin is a killer, he said, well, America hasnt been that much better in this regard also. To me it seems, and I think to a lot of Americans it seems that this President has not been tough on Russia. How can you say that?MR. SPICER: Because I just walked through it. I think theres a difference between the President wanting to have an understanding of how a good relationship with Russia can help us defeat ISIS and terrorism throughout the world. Look, the Obama administration tried to have a reset with Russia. They failed. They tried to tell Russia not to invade Crimea. They failed. This President understands that its in Americas national and economic interests to have a healthy relationship. If he has a great relationship with Putin in Russia, great. If he doesnt, then hell continue on. But hes not going to just assume that because it wasnt able to happen in the past -- I think youve seen, with Prime Minister Abe in particular and others, that the reset that Prime Minister Netanyahu talked about tomorrow -- so many of these countries from around the globe are looking forward to resetting the relationships that this country has with them; that they feel as though they were abandoned over the last eight years, and that they are excited about the prospect of a new U.S. relationship under a Trump administration.But with respect to Russia, I think the comments that Ambassador Haley made at the U.N. were extremely forceful and very clear that until --Q  That was an announcement from Haley, not the President.MR. SPICER: She speaks for the President. I speak for the President. All of us in this administration. And so all of the actions and all of the words in this administration are on behalf and at the direction of this President. So I dont think we could be any clearer on the Presidents commitment.Katie Pavlich.Q  Quick little follow-up, because I havent had any follow-ups or questions in a while. But anyway --MR. SPICER: Really?Q  No -- the other question is, just getting back to what was asked a few moments ago about trust and being misled. Are you saying that the national security advisor was intentionally misleading the President, the Vice President, yourself when he made these comments to you about that conversation?MR. SPICER: No, look, the trust is given by the President. Its a relationship between he and any individual. And so, as I mentioned in the comments, maybe it was because -- I don't know that it was intentional, he may have just forgotten, but I think at some point trust isnt just --Q  Isn't that kind of a weird thing to forget, though, in a conversation where you talk about --MR. SPICER: But thats the point, Jim, is that at some point that trust eroded to a point where the President did not feel comfortable with him serving in that position, and asked for and received his resignation.Katie Pavlich.Q  Sean, on the trust issue and the eroding of trust, last night, in General Flynns resignation letter, he said he inadvertently briefed the Vice President-elect and others with incomplete information.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  Considering his role in advising the President on national security matters, is the White House concerned that he maybe briefed the President-elect, Vice President-elect with incomplete information on other matters of national security in addition to his phone calls with the Russian ambassador?MR. SPICER: Well, when you look at the team, its not one person in isolation, Katie. Its several. Youve got General Kelly on the homeland security front, General Mattis on the DOD front -- hes got an entire national security staff and apparatus that briefs him -- you know, Director Pompeo at the CIA, and others from the DNIs office that come in and brief him on a whole host of issues. So its not a single position.Q  So was his situation an isolated incident of giving incomplete --MR. SPICER: Well, yeah. Regardless of whether its a single situation, its not as though theres one person briefing him. And the President synthesizes a lot of information, both written and stuff that is briefed to him, and ultimately it is he who makes that decision based a lot on what he already knows, what he is presented with. So the President gets information from a lot of people -- generals, admirals, people in the military community, ambassadors, people in the State Department, an exhaustive team at the National Security Council, and then makes an ultimate decision based on that and what he already knows to be the case.Q  Sean, youve been asked a couple times about these transcripts of calls. Will the White House declassify those and release them?MR. SPICER: Looks, it is inappropriate for me to comment on those at this time. Right now, the focus is on some of the evolving issues that were going around the globe, as you know.Q  Will you be open to it?MR. SPICER: Let me answer the question. It is not an issue that has come up. I think the President right now is focused on replacing his national security advisor, making sure that hes presented with the best possible information to make these key decisions.But at this time, we also have got to be careful that we were not involving ourselves in a matter of national security. And the review, as I mentioned, was done and then immediately last night when the President felt as though it was time for a decision, made it. Thats where we are in this iteration of the process. If we have anything further for you, we will update you.I want to go to Joyce Kaufman of WFTL Talk News in Palm Beach, Florida.Q  Thank you so much for this opportunity. Im approximately six miles away from Mar-a-Lago right now, and the President met with Prime Minister Abe from Japan at Mar-a-Lago this weekend. And besides giving us traffic and security nightmares, there were apparently conversations that took place by telephone and with the Prime Minister that were in a relatively insecure dining area. There is already video of this surfacing. Will there be a SCIF put in place in these dining areas, these public places? And one last question. When he meets with Prime Minister Netanyahu tomorrow, will they be discussing moving the embassy, and settlements?MR. SPICER: On the second one, Im not going to get ahead of the Prime Ministers discussion with the President. Well have a readout. After that, there will be a press conference.With respect to the first, there is a SCIF at Mar-a-Lago. And just to be clear, the briefing -- the President was briefed in a SCIF ahead of dinner. He went with his national security team. They briefed him on the situation in North Korea. Subsequently, he had a dinner, of which was attended exclusively by U.S. and Japanese delegation members. At that time, apparently there was a photo taken, which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions about what may or may not be discussed. There was simply a discussion about press logistics, where to host the event. And then after the dinner, the President went back into the SCIF to get a further update from his team.So Im not really sure where people jumped to conclusions. There is a SCIF there. It was utilized on two occasions that evening to convey to the President by his national security team the situation in North Korea. And then the President subsequently stood shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese President to make sure that our commitment to their security and stand against North Korea was fully made aware.Margaret.Q  Sean, can you just clarify, because I got a little turned around -- did President Trump, or President-elect Trump at the time, know of General Flynns discussion of the sanctions while he was NSC-designate? And if not, when did he finally learn about them? And if so, why was he okay with that?MR. SPICER: So, no, he was not aware, as hes not back-briefed on every conversation that his national security team has or other staffers. They were performing their duties, as other people were in terms of getting up to speed, conveying with counterparts and previous members of their team. That being said, when he was made aware of it, once the White House Counsel briefed him on concerns the Department of Justice had -- and at that point, as I mentioned, what he asked and what he believed at the time and was confirmed by White House Counsel was that there was no legal issue here. Discussing the issue didnt violate anything; it was appropriate in the normal course of action to discuss that. And he immediately asked the White House Counsel to further confirm what his instincts were at the time.Thank you, guys. Have a great one. Weve got everybody for a bill signing. Weve got a bill signing.Q  I didnt get my --MR. SPICER: Oh, hes got -- Margaret gets a follow-up, but hes got --Q  Are you -- is the administration undertaking any sort of effort, either Cabinet-wide or, like, inside the shop to make sure that everyone comes forward who had any communications with the Russians about sanctions or otherwise?MR. SPICER: Theres no other information. I mean, as far as we are aware, that is an isolated incident that occurred. And again, the key point in this isnt that there were discussions. There was nothing wrong or inappropriate about those discussions. It purely came down to a matter of trust. Thats it.Thank you, guys. See you tomorrow. Happy Valentines Day.END2:00 P.M.

154,2017-02-14,President Trump: Cutting Red Tape for American Businesses,"GETTING GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY: Today, President Donald J. Trump signed legislation (House Joint Resolution 41) eliminating a costly regulation that threatened to put domestic extraction companies and their employees at an unfair disadvantage.H.J. Res. 41 blocks a misguided regulation from burdening American extraction companies.By halting this regulation, the President has removed a costly impediment to American extraction companies helping their workers succeed.This legislation could save American businesses as much as $600 million annually in regulatory compliance costs and spare them 200,000 hours of paperwork.The regulation created an unfair advantage for foreign-owned extraction companies.BUILDING ON PRESIDENTIAL ACTION: President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on everyday Americans, their pocketbooks, and their businesses.President Trump has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated.President Trump will initiate fundamental changes to the United States healthcare system to reduce the financial burden on Americans by getting the government out of the way.President Trump has placed a moratorium on all new regulations by executive departments and agencies that are not compelled by Congress or public safety.President Trump directed his Secretary of Commerce to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers.President Trump signed an Executive Order expediting the environmental review and approval processes for domestic infrastructure projects.President Trump directed the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a full review of Dodd-Frank to ensure associated, burdensome regulations receive proper scrutiny.President Trump ordered re-examination of the Department of Labors fiduciary rule, to make certain that it does not harm Americans as they save for retirement.",20504.41,92.25,5782.57,18.609999999999673,2337.58,9.329999999999927
155,2017-02-14,Remarks by President Trump at Parent-Teacher Conference Listening Session,"Roosevelt Room10:50 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Well, I am delighted to welcome everybody to the White House. And Betsy DeVos, who has gone through -- our new Education Secretary -- she went through an interesting moment. And you're going to do a fantastic job, and I know you would have done it again if you had to do it again, right? (Laughter.)SECRETARY DEVOS: Probably.THE PRESIDENT: She had no doubt that final night, waiting for the vote. So I just want to congratulate you. You showed toughness and genius.As I said many times in my campaign, we want every child in America to have the opportunity to climb the ladder to success. I want every child also to have a safe community, and we're going to do that very much. We're going to be helping you a lot -- a great school and some day to get a really well-paying job or better, or better; own their own company. And a lot of people are looking at that. But it all begins with education, and that's why we're here this morning. And I'm here also to celebrate a little bit with Betsy because we started this journey a long time ago, having to do with change and so many other good things with education. And I'm so happy that that all worked out.Right now, too many of our children don't have the opportunity to get that education that we all talk about. Millions of poor, disadvantaged students are trapped in failing schools and this crisis -- and it really is a crisis -- of education and communities working together but not working out. And we're going to change it around, especially for the African American communities. It's been very, very tough and unfair. And I know that's a priority and it's a certainly a priority of mine.That's why I want every single disadvantaged child in America, no matter what their background or where they live, to have a choice about where they go to school. And it's worked out so well in some communities where it's been properly run and properly done. And it's a terrific thing.Charter schools, in particular, have demonstrated amazing gains and results. And you look at the results -- we have cases in New York City that have been amazing in providing education to disadvantaged children and the success of so many different schools that I can name throughout the country that I got to see during the campaign. I went to one in Las Vegas; it was the most unbelievable thing you've ever seen. And they've done a fantastic job.So there are many such schools and we want to do that on a large-scale basis. We can never lose sight of the connection between education and jobs. I'm bringing a lot of jobs back. We're bringing a lot of big plants back into the country -- everyone said it was impossible. And before I even took office, we started the process and tremendous numbers of plants are coming back into this country -- car plants and other plants. And I have meetings next week with four or five different companies, big ones that are going to bring massive numbers of jobs back. So we're doing it from the jobs standpoint, but education only makes it better. Our goal is a clear and very safe community, great schools, and we want those jobs that are high-paying jobs -- we've lost a lot of our best jobs to other countries and we're going to bring them back. So Im going to do my job, and Betsy, at the education level, will do her job. And just to do it very, very formally, I want to congratulate you on having gone through a very tough trial and a very unfair trial, and you won. And theres something very nice about that. And Ill tell you the real winner will be the children -- I guess a couple of adults (inaudible) -- but will be the children of this country. And I just want to congratulate you.SECRETARY DEVOS: Thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps well go around the room. And everybody knows our fantastic Vice President, Mike Pence. But if we went around the room, it would be very nice. So why dont we start? Betsy, you might want to say a few words to us.SECRETARY DEVOS: Well, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President, I am just very honored to have the opportunity to serve Americas students, and Im really excited to be here today with parents and educators representing traditional public schools, charter public schools, homeschools, private schools, a range of choices. And were eager to listen and learn from you your ideas for how we can ensure that all of our kids have an equal opportunity for a high-quality, great education and therefore an opportunity for the future.So again, I just wanted to have the opportunity to serve, and looking forward to fulfilling the mission that you set forward.THE PRESIDENT: Its our honor -- believe me, Betsy.Kenneth.MR.

In fact, our school has shifted its population -- saw more children with autism, definitely.THE PRESIDENT: So whats going on with autism? When you look at the tremendous increases, really, its such an incredible -- its like really a horrible thing to watch, the tremendous amount of increase. Do you have any idea? And youre seeing it in the school?MS.

158,2017-02-15,Joint Readout of Meeting Between President Donald J. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,"Today, President Donald J. Trump welcomed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the Oval Office and reaffirmed the special relationship and unbreakable bond between the United States and Israel. The tremendous strength of the United States-Israel relationship is reflected in the close partnership between our governments, and also in the ties that connect the peoples of Israel and the United States. Our deep-rooted political, military, economic, and social ties reflect our shared values, strategic interests, and dynamic economic and trade relationship.In today's meeting, President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed that there will be no daylight between the United States and Israel. The President underscored the United States' unwavering commitment to Israel's security, and that his Administration will safeguard and strengthen the overall security relationship. The President and Prime Minister agreed on the need to counter the threats posed by Iran and its proxies, in addition to countering the so-called ""Islamic State"" and other radical Islamic terrorist groups, so as to create a more secure Middle East to the benefit of all countries. The two leaders agreed that the Iran nuclear deal is a terrible deal for the United States, Israel, and the world. The President assured the Prime Minister that Iran must not, and will not, obtain nuclear weapons capability. The two leaders also discussed the crisis in Syria and other regional issues. The United States and Israel stand together facing a range of challenges, and the two leaders pledged to deepen cooperation to bring greater peace and stability to the Middle East and to protect the United States, Israel, and other nations from the global threat of terrorism.President Trump reiterated his desire for peace throughout the Middle East, and for reaching a comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The President and Prime Minister agreed that peace between Israel and the Palestinians can only be negotiated directly between the two parties, and that the United States will work closely with Israel and the Palestinians to make progress toward that goal. The two leaders discussed the issue of Israeli settlement construction, and agreed to continue those discussions and to work out an approach that is consistent with the goal of advancing peace and security.President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed on their mutual goal of making the United States-Israel relationship even closer as both countries pursue shared interests in the region. The two leaders have directed their respective teams to form joint working groups in the months ahead to dramatically improve bilateral relations in a number of areas, including cyber, intelligence, security, trade, technology, countering the threats posed by Iran and other actors, and promoting Arab-Israeli cooperation, including economic cooperation. A working group will also focus on enabling the growth of the Palestinian economy.It is a new day for the United States-Israel relationship, defined by a responsible approach to the challenges and opportunities our two countries face in the Middle East.",20611.86,107.45000000000073,5819.44,36.86999999999989,2349.25,11.670000000000073

As law clerks who have worked at his side, we know that Judge Gorsuch never resolves a case by the light of his personal view of what the law should be, they said. Nor does he ever bend the law to reach a particular result he desires.He has never feared staking out a principled position ... even if he had to do so alone, they wrote. If confirmed, we are confident that Judge Gorsuchs independence  grounded in the limited powers granted to the judiciary by the Constitution  will never waver.ReadUSA Today's article about the letter here.",20611.86,107.45000000000073,5819.44,36.86999999999989,2349.25,11.670000000000073

163,2017-02-15,Remarks by President Trump in Listening Session with the Retail Industry Leaders Association and Member Company CEOs,"Roosevelt Room10:40 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: So it's nice to see we have some great retailers here today and we're going to go around the room and we'll all introduce ourselves. Some of you I've read about on the covers of business magazines and it's great to have you here. Thank you very much.I'm pleased to host all of you at the White House. The CEOs -- you're some of the great CEOs of our country and the biggest in the retail industry, which is very important to the country in supporting millions and millions of jobs -- really one of the great job producers. Probably, would you say, almost number one? Pretty close, right?MR. KUSHNER: I agree.THE PRESIDENT: It is number one.There's a lot of confidence in our economy right now. There's a great confidence level. You've been seeing that in the stock market. You've been seeing that in businesses. And you've been seeing that at every chart that's taken. There's evidence also by the jobs report that just came out for January -- 227,000 jobs added. My administration remains very focused on the issues that will encourage economic growth -- that's what we're all about. We have a lot of plants moving back into various states, including the state of Ohio, the state of Michigan, Pennsylvania. You have a lot of companies moving back in, coming back into the country, bringing the jobs with them.We're cutting regulations big league. We are really cutting them by massive amounts. The auto industry just left a week ago -- they were here in the same room -- and they are very happy with what we're doing and everyone is. I think just about every -- the financial industry. We're having a lot of the different industries in and we're cutting regulations in just about every industry. In fact, I can't think of any that we're not. If I do, we have a major story, okay, because I think just every industry we're cutting, some more than others. You have a very, very big regulatory problem and we're going to take care of that because I want more jobs. We're doing that because we want more jobs.As you know, the overregulation costs our economy an estimated $2 trillion a year, which is incredible -- $2 trillion -- and it costs your businesses a lot of money, tremendous amounts of money and time. I've taken executive action to create a permanent structure of regulatory reduction by creating one and one. So basically, for every one regulation, two are out. So we knock out two. So we put in one, but to put in one, you have to knock out two. That's the least of it, but it's an important symbol.In addition to reducing government regulations, we'll also reform our tax code to help middle-income families and American businesses grow and thrive. Tax reform is one of the best opportunities to really impact our economy. So we're doing a massive tax plan. It's coming along really well. It will be submitted in the not-too-distant future, and it will be not only good and simpler; it will be -- you're talking about big numbers of savings. And we're talking also middle income and very much for business. And the business is for middle income because you can employ a lot of people. So we hope you're going to do that. We're going to provide tax relief for families. We're going to simplify very greatly the tax code -- it's too complicated. We're going to bring down the number of alternatives, and I think it's going to be just a much, much simpler tax code. In fact, H&R Block probably won't be too happy -- that's one business that might not be happy with what we're doing. Other than H&R Block, I think people are going to love it.We're going to lower the rates very, very substantially for virtually everybody in every category, including personal and business. And I just want to go around the room. I'd like you to introduce yourself and then I'll tell you a little bit more, and you're going to tell me what you're looking for. But we want jobs. We want jobs brought back to the country. We want them brought back fast. We want you to expand your stores. And you'll tell me why you will or why you won't. And tell me why you won't -- we'll work on you a little bit, right, Vice President Mike Pence? (Laughter.)So go ahead.MS. SOLTAU: I'm Jill Soltau. I'm with JoAnn Fabric and Craft Stores.MR.

165,2017-02-15,Remarks by President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel in Joint Press Conference ,"[As prepared by White House stenographer in real time]East Room12:15 P.M. ESTPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you. Today I have the honor of welcoming my friend, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to the White House. With this visit, the United States again reaffirms our unbreakable bond with our cherished ally, Israel. The partnership between our two countries built on our shared values has advanced the cause of human freedom, dignity and peace. These are the building blocks of democracy. The state of Israel is a symbol to the world of resilience in the face of oppression -- I can think of no other state that's gone through what they've gone -- and of survival in the face of genocide. We will never forget what the Jewish people have endured. Your perseverance in the face of hostility, your open democracy in the face of violence, and your success in the face of tall odds is truly inspirational. The security challenges faced by Israel are enormous, including the threat of Iran's nuclear ambitions, which I've talked a lot about. One of the worst deals I've ever seen is the Iran deal. My administration has already imposed new sanctions on Iran, and I will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing -- I mean ever -- a nuclear weapon.Our security assistance to Israel is currently at an all-time high, ensuring that Israel has the ability to defend itself from threats of which there are unfortunately many. Both of our countries will continue and grow. We have a long history of cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the fight against those who do not value human life. America and Israel are two nations that cherish the value of all human life.This is one more reason why I reject unfair and one-sided actions against Israel at the United Nations -- just treated Israel, in my opinion, very, very unfairly -- or other international forums, as well as boycotts that target Israel. Our administration is committed to working with Israel and our common allies in the region towards greater security and stability. That includes working toward a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. The United States will encourage a peace and, really, a great peace deal. We'll be working on it very, very diligently. Very important to me also -- something we want to do. But it is the parties themselves who must directly negotiate such an agreement. We'll be beside them; we'll be working with them.As with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises. You know that, right? (Laughter.) PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Both sides.PRESIDENT TRUMP: I want the Israeli people to know that the United States stands with Israel in the struggle against terrorism. As you know, Mr. Prime Minister, our two nations will always condemn terrorist acts. Peace requires nations to uphold the dignity of human life and to be a voice for all of those who are endangered and forgotten. Those are the ideals to which we all, and will always, aspire and commit. This will be the first of many productive meetings. And I, again, Mr. Prime Minister, thank you very much for being with us today. Mr. Prime Minister, thank you.PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: President Trump, thank you for the truly warm hospitality you and Melania have shown me, my wife Sara, our entire delegation. I deeply value your friendship. To me, to the state of Israel, it was so clearly evident in the words you just spoke -- Israel has no better ally than the United States. And I want to assure you, the United States has no better ally than Israel.Our alliance has been remarkably strong, but under your leadership Im confident it will get even stronger. I look forward to working with you to dramatically upgrade our alliance in every field -- in security, in technology, in cyber and trade, and so many others. And I certainly welcome your forthright call to ensure that Israel is treated fairly in international forums, and that the slander and boycotts of Israel are resisted mightily by the power and moral position of the United States of America.As you have said, our alliance is based on a deep bond of common values and common interests. And, increasingly, those values and interests are under attack by one malevolent force: radical Islamic terror. Mr. President, youve shown great clarity and courage in confronting this challenge head-on. You call for confronting Irans terrorist regime, preventing Iran from realizing this terrible deal into a nuclear arsenal. And you have said that the United States is committed to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons. You call for the defeat of ISIS. Under your leadership, I believe we can reverse the rising tide of radical Islam. And in this great task, as in so many others, Israel stands with you and I stand with you.Mr. President, in rolling back militant Islam, we can seize an historic opportunity -- because, for the first time in my lifetime, and for the first time in the life of my country, Arab countries in the region do not see Israel as an enemy, but, increasingly, as an ally. And I believe that under your leadership, this change in our region creates an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen security and advance peace.Let us seize this moment together. Let us bolster security. Let us seek new avenues of peace. And let us bring the remarkable alliance between Israel and the United States to even greater heights. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you. Again, thank you. Well take a couple of questions. David Brody, Christian Broadcasting. David.Q  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. Both of you have criticized the Iran nuclear deal, and at times even called for its repeal. Im wondering if youre concerned at all as it relates to not just the National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who is recently no longer here, but also some of those events that have been going on with communication in Russia -- if that is going to hamper this deal at all, and whether or not it would keep Iran from becoming a nuclear state. And secondly, on the settlement issue, are you both on the same page? How do you exactly term that as it relates to the settlement issue? Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Michael Flynn, General Flynn is a wonderful man. I think hes been treated very, very unfairly by the media -- as I call it, the fake media, in many cases. And I think its really a sad thing that he was treated so badly. I think, in addition to that, from intelligence -- papers are being leaked, things are being leaked. Its criminal actions, criminal act, and its been going on for a long time -- before me. But now its really going on, and people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton. I think its very, very unfair whats happened to General Flynn, the way he was treated, and the documents and papers that were illegally -- I stress that -- illegally leaked. Very, very unfair.As far as settlements, Id like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit. Well work something out. But I would like to see a deal be made. I think a deal will be made. I know that every President would like to. Most of them have not started until late because they never thought it was possible. And it wasnt possible because they didn't do it.But Bibi and I have known each other a long time -- a smart man, great negotiator. And I think we're going to make a deal. It might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand. That's a possibility. So lets see what we do.PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Lets try it.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Doesn't sound too optimistic, but -- (laughter) -- hes a good negotiator.PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: That's the art of the deal. (Laughter.) PRESIDENT TRUMP: I also want to thank -- I also want to thank -- Sara, could you please stand up? You're so lovely and you've been so nice to Melania. I appreciate it very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Your turn.PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Yes, please. Go ahead.Q  Thank you very much. Mr. President, in your vision for the new Middle East peace, are you ready to give up the notion of two-state solution that was adopted by previous administration? And will you be willing to hear different ideas from the Prime Minister, as some of his partners are asking him to do, for example, annexation of parts of the West Bank and unrestricted settlement constructions? And one more question: Are you going to fulfill your promise to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem? And if so, when?And, Mr. Prime Minister, did you come here tonight to tell the President that you're backing off the two-state solution?Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: So Im looking at two-state and one-state, and I like the one that both parties like. (Laughter.) Im very happy with the one that both parties like. I can live with either one. I thought for a while the two-state looked like it may be the easier of the two. But honestly, if Bibi and if the Palestinians -- if Israel and the Palestinians are happy, Im happy with the one they like the best. As far as the embassy moving to Jerusalem, Id love to see that happen. We're looking at it very, very strongly. We're looking at it with great care -- great care, believe me. And well see what happens. Okay?PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Thank you. I read yesterday that an American official said that if you ask five people what two states would look like, youd get eight different answers. Mr. President, if you ask five Israelis, youd get 12 different answers. (Laughter.)But rather than deal with labels, I want to deal with substance. Its something Ive hoped to do for years in a world that's absolutely fixated on labels and not on substance. So heres the substance: There are two prerequisites for peace that I laid out two years -- several years ago, and they havent changed.First, the Palestinians must recognize the Jewish state. They have to stop calling for Israels destruction. They have to stop educating their people for Israels destruction.Second, in any peace agreement, Israel must retain the overriding security control over the entire area west of the Jordan River. Because if we don't, we know what will happen -- because otherwise well get another radical Islamic terrorist state in the Palestinian areas exploding the peace, exploding the Middle East.Now, unfortunately, the Palestinians vehemently reject both prerequisites for peace. First, they continue to call for Israels destruction -- inside their schools, inside their mosques, inside the textbooks. You have to read it to believe it. They even deny, Mr. President, our historical connection to our homeland. And I suppose you have to ask yourself: Why do - - why are Jews called Jews? Well, the Chinese are called Chinese because they come from China. The Japanese are called Japanese because they come from Japan. Well, Jews are called Jews because they come from Judea. This is our ancestral homeland. Jews are not foreign colonialists in Judea.So, unfortunately, the Palestinians not only deny the past, they also poison the present. They name public squares in honor of mass murderers who murdered Israelis, and I have to say also murdered Americans. They fund -- they pay monthly salaries to the families of murderers, like the family of the terrorist who killed Taylor Force, a wonderful young American, a West Point graduate, who was stabbed to death while visiting Israel.So this is the source of the conflict -- the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize the Jewish state in any boundary; this persistent rejection. That's the reason we don't have peace. Now, that has to change. I want it to change. Not only have I not abandoned these two prerequisites of peace; they've become even more important because of the rising tide of fanaticism that has swept the Middle East and has also, unfortunately, infected Palestinian society.So I want this to change. I want those two prerequisites of peace -- substance, not labels -- I want them reinstated. But if anyone believes that I, as Prime Minister of Israel, responsible for the security of my country, would blindly walk into a Palestinian terrorist state that seeks the destruction of my country, they're gravely mistaken. The two prerequisites of peace -- recognition of the Jewish state, and Israel's security needs west of the Jordan -- they remain pertinent. We have to look for new ways, new ideas on how to reinstate them and how to move peace forward. And I believe that the great opportunity for peace comes from a regional approach from involving our newfound Arab partners in the pursuit of a broader peace and peace with the Palestinians. And I greatly look forward to discussing this in detail with you, Mr. President, because I think that if we work together, we have a shot.PRESIDENT TRUMP: And we have been discussing that, and it is something that is very different, hasn't been discussed before. And it's actually a much bigger deal, a much more important deal, in a sense. It would take in many, many countries and it would cover a very large territory. So I didn't know you were going to be mentioning that, but that's -- now that you did, I think it's a terrific thing and I think we have some pretty good cooperation from people that in the past would never, ever have even thought about doing this. So we'll see how that works out.Katie from Townhall. Where's Katie? Right there. Katie.Q  Thank you, Mr. President. You said in your earlier remarks that both sides will have to make compromises when it comes to a peace deal. You've mentioned a halt on settlements. Can you lay out a few more specific compromises that you have in mind, both for the Israelis and for the Palestinians? And, Mr. Prime Minister, what expectations do you have from the new administration about how to either amend the Iran nuclear agreement or how to dismantle it altogether, and how to overall work with the new administration to combat Iran's increased aggression, not only in the last couple of months but the past couple of years as well?PRESIDENT TRUMP: It's actually an interesting question. I think that the Israelis are going to have to show some flexibility, which is hard, it's hard to do. They're going to have to show the fact that they really want to make a deal. I think our new concept that we've been discussing actually for a while is something that allows them to show more flexibility than they have in the past because you have a lot bigger canvas to play with. And I think they'll do that. I think they very much would like to make a deal or I wouldn't be happy and I wouldn't be here and I wouldn't be as optimistic as I am. I really think they -- I can tell you from the standpoint of Bibi and from the standpoint of Israel, I really believe they want to make a deal and they'd like to see the big deal.I think the Palestinians have to get rid of some of that hate that they're taught from a very young age. They're taught tremendous hate. I've seen what they're taught. And you can talk about flexibility there too, but it starts at a very young age and it starts in the school room. And they have to acknowledge Israel -- they're going to have to do that. There's no way a deal can be made if they're not ready to acknowledge a very, very great and important country. And I think they're going to be willing to do that also. But now I also believe we're going to have, Katie, other players at a very high level, and I think it might make it easier on both the Palestinians and Israel to get something done.Okay? Thank you. Very interesting question. Thank you.PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: You asked about Iran. One thing is preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons -- something that President Trump and I think are deeply committed to do. And we are obviously going to discuss that. I think, beyond that, President Trump has led a very important effort in the past few weeks, just coming into the presidency. He pointed out there are violations, Iranian violations on ballistic missile tests. By the way, these ballistic missiles are inscribed in Hebrew, ""Israel must be destroyed."" The Palestinian -- rather the Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif said, well, our ballistic missiles are not intended against any country. No. They write on the missile in Hebrew, ""Israel must be destroyed."" So challenging Iran on its violations of ballistic missiles, imposing sanctions on Hezbollah, preventing them, making them pay for the terrorism that they foment throughout the Middle East and beyond, well beyond -- I think that's a change that is clearly evident since President Trump took office. I welcome that. I think it's -- let me say this very openly: I think it's long overdue, and I think that if we work together -- and not just the United States and Israel, but so many others in the region who see eye to eye on the great magnitude and danger of the Iranian threat, then I think we can roll back Iran's aggression and danger. And that's something that is important for Israel, the Arab states, but I think it's vitally important for America. These guys are developing ICBMs. They're developing -- they want to get to a nuclear arsenal, not a bomb, a hundred bombs. And they want to have the ability to launch them everywhere on Earth, and including, and especially, eventually, the United States. So this is something that is important for all of us. I welcome the change, and I intend to work with President Trump very closely so that we can thwart this danger.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Great. Do you have somebody?PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Moav (ph)?Q  Mr. President, since your election campaign and even after your victory, weve seen a sharp rise in anti-Semitic incidents across the United States. And I wonder what you say to those among the Jewish community in the States, and in Israel, and maybe around the world who believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones.And, Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree to what the President just said about the need for Israel to restrain or to stop settlement activity in the West Bank? And a quick follow-up on my friends questions -- simple question: Do you back off from your vision to the end of the conflict of two-state solution as you laid out in Bar-Ilan speech, or you still support it? Thank you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had -- 306 Electoral College votes. We were not supposed to crack 220. You know that, right? There was no way to 221, but then they said theres no way to 270. And theres tremendous enthusiasm out there. I will say that we are going to have peace in this country. We are going to stop crime in this country. We are going to do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism and every other thing thats going on, because lot of bad things have been taking place over a long period of time. I think one of the reasons I won the election is we have a very, very divided nation. Very divided. And, hopefully, Ill be able to do something about that. And, you know, it was something that was very important to me.As far as people -- Jewish people -- so many friends, a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law, and three beautiful grandchildren. I think that youre going to see a lot different United States of America over the next three, four, or eight years. I think a lot of good things are happening, and youre going to see a lot of love. Youre going to see a lot of love. Okay? Thank you.PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: I believe that the issue of the settlements is not the core of the conflict, nor does it really drive the conflict. I think its an issue, it has to be resolved in the context of peace negotiations. And I think we also are going to speak about it, President Trump and I, so we can arrive at an understanding so we dont keep on bumping into each other all the time on this issue. And were going to discuss this.On the question you said, you just came back with your question to the problem that I said. Its the label. What does Abu Mazen mean by two states, okay? What does he mean? A state that doesnt recognize the Jewish state? A state that basically is open for attack against Israel? What are we talking about? Are we talking about Costa Rica, or are we talking about another Iran?So obviously it means different things. I told you what are the conditions that I believe are necessary for an agreement: Its the recognition of the Jewish state and it's Israels -- Israels -- security control of the entire area. Otherwise were just fantasizing. Otherwise well get another failed state, another terrorist Islamist dictatorship that will not work for peace but work to destroy us but also destroy any hope -- any hope -- for a peaceful future for our people. So Ive been very clear about those conditions, and they havent changed. I havent changed. If you read what I said eight years ago, its exactly that. And I repeated that again, and again, and again. If you want to deal with labels, deal with labels. Ill deal with substance.And finally, if I can respond to something that I know from personal experience. Ive known President Trump for many years, and to allude to him, or to his people -- his team, some of whom Ive known for many years, too. Can I reveal, Jared, how long weve known you? (Laughter.) Well, he was never small. He was always big. He was always tall. But Ive known the President and Ive known his family and his team for a long time, and there is no greater supporter of the Jewish people and the Jewish state than President Donald Trump. I think we should put that to rest.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Very nice. I appreciate that very much.PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU: Thank you.END12:42 P.M.

As law clerks who have worked at his side, we know that Judge Gorsuch never resolves a case by the light of his personal view of what the law should be, they said. Nor does he ever bend the law to reach a particular result he desires.He has never feared staking out a principled position ... even if he had to do so alone, they wrote. If confirmed, we are confident that Judge Gorsuchs independence  grounded in the limited powers granted to the judiciary by the Constitution  will never waver.Read USA Todays article about the letter here.",20611.86,107.45000000000073,5819.44,36.86999999999989,2349.25,11.670000000000073

The two leaders reaffirmed the special relationship between the United States and Israel and underscored the unbreakable bond between our two countries. The Vice President reiterated the United States' unwavering commitment to Israel's security and pledged to work with Prime Minister Netanyahu to address the shared challenges we face throughout the Middle East, including the threats posed by Iran and its proxies as well as ISIS and other radical Islamic terrorist organizations. The two leaders discussed ways that the United States and Israel can work more closely together on critical issues such as cyber security, intelligence cooperation, and energy. They also agreed to work together against one-sided actions against Israel at the United Nations and other international forums, as well as boycotts that target Israel. The Vice President and the Prime Minister agreed that peace between Israel and the Palestinians can only be negotiated directly between the two parties, and that the United States will work closely with Israel and the Palestinians to make progress towards that goal.",20619.77,7.9099999999998545,5814.9,-4.539999999999964,2347.22,-2.0300000000002

169,2017-02-16,ICYMI: Democrats' Supreme Court Double Standard,"Democrats' Supreme Court double standardUSA TodayBy Sen. Chuck GrassleyWe will keep our word and put Judge Gorsuch on the Supreme Court.The late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was an intellectual giant and a revered defender of the Constitution and the limited role of the judiciary in our Republic. His contributions to the court and to broader judicial philosophy will endure for years. Now, well keep our word to the American people to consider a nominee by the new president.The nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill Scalias seat is the product of the most transparent and democratic judicial nomination process in recent history. On the campaign trail, candidate Donald Trumps list of 21 potential nominees for the vacancy provided rare insight into who could be the next justice in a Trump presidency. The vacancy was on the minds of many voters as they elected Trump to be our next president. According to the Pew Research Center, 65% of voters considered the vacancy very important as they went to the polls.Prior to the presidents announcement, the minority leader called on him to nominate a mainstream candidate. There can be no serious debate that Judge Gorsuch meets that standard. Hes been praised by legal experts across the political spectrum as a mainstream jurist who applies the law without regard to person, politics or his own preferences. President Obamas former solicitor general called him one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century. Thats high praise. In 2006 Judge Gorsuch sailed through the Senate with unanimous approval. Thirty-one sitting senators were in the Senate when Gorsuch was confirmed, including 12 Democrats. Nonetheless, we have promised a rigorous and thorough review of this nominee, and thats what well do.The committee will follow the established confirmation timeline for modern Supreme Court vacancies, with a hearing roughly six weeks after the initial nomination. That is more than sufficient time for senators to review his record.Unfortunately, some Senate Democrats signaled plans to block any nomination made by the newly-elected president even before he announced his nomination. Theyre doing so after criticizing Republicans for taking a principled position about a lame duck president that was advocated by Democrats for decades.Instead, we will keep our word and we will fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court.Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.Read the entire article here.",20619.77,7.9099999999998545,5814.9,-4.539999999999964,2347.22,-2.0300000000002

(Applause.)Grateful to be joined by family and friends, but most especially grateful to be joined by Pam Mulvaney. Pam, thank you for being here and thank you for your familys commitment to the United States in this new chapter.We also have with us a distinguished group of guests. Senator Mike Enzi, chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget, is with us today. Mr. Chairman, thank you for being with us today.Senator Ron Johnson, also on the budget committee. And the Congressmans good friends Senator Tom Cotton, Representative Mark Meadows, Representative Justin Amash, and of course, his fellow South Carolinians -- Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Tim Scott and Representative Joe Wilson. That's quite a turnout, and I know it means the world to the President, as it does to our new director. Give all these members a round of applause. (Applause.)In Congressman Mick Mulvaney, President Trump has nominated someone with an extraordinary record in public and private life. He once described himself as a serial entrepreneur, starting no fewer than four businesses over the course of his life. And along the way, he established himself as a principled, results-driven leader. And hell be bringing those leadership qualities and his well-earned reputation for fiscal responsibility to his new role leading the Office of Management and Budget.These qualities have served him well in public office. In 2006, he won a seat in South Carolinas House of Representatives, followed two years later by a seat in the state senate. Two years after that, he ran for the United States Congress on a promise of faithfully serving the good people of the Palmetto State. I had the great pleasure of knowing Congressman Mulvaney as a member of Congress, and I couldnt be more enthusiastic at the Presidents decision to task him to lead this vitally important agency and our national budget.He quickly established himself in the Congress, as I saw firsthand, as one of the leading fiscal experts on Capitol Hill. He work on the House committees on financial services, oversight, and government reform only added to that sterling reputation. A happy warrior on behalf of fiscal responsibility, Mick Mulvaney will bring those very same qualities to the Office of Management and Budget.Mick, President Trump has asked you to lead the Office of Management and Budget, a vital role in a day and age of deficits and debt. And we're both very confident that your leadership, your integrity, and your commitment to protecting Americas fiscal and economic future will serve all the people of the United States with great distinction.Thank you for stepping up at this time in the life of our nation.

Trump signed legislation (House Joint Resolution 38) to stop the costly Stream Protection Rule from further harming coal workers and the communities that depend on them.H.J. Res. 38 blocks an overly burdensome regulation from harming the coal industry.The regulation was expected to reduce coal production, leading to fewer coal jobs across the country.The blocked regulation threatened the coal industry with millions of dollars in compliance costs.Complying with the regulation would have put an unsustainable financial burden on small mines, most of which are in the Appalachian Basin.The blocked regulation would have duplicated existing regulations already in place to protect Americans.GIVING COAL COUNTRY RELIEF: Since 2009, the coal industry has declined, leaving workers and communities without a lifeline. Since January 2009, the coal mining industry has lost over 36,000 jobs without any relief in sight.From 2009 to 2015, coal production declined by over 177,000,000 tons across the country.From 2009 to 2015, over 600 coal mines closed.A PROMISE TO COAL WORKERS: Before President Trumps inauguration, he promised coal workers he would support them and reverse the harmful actions of the past administration.November 21, 2016, the Trump-Pence Transition Team pledged to end the war on coal and review harmful regulations created under the Obama Administration.September 22, 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump called out harmful coal regulations: I will rescind the coal mining lease moratorium, the excessive Interior Department stream rule, and conduct a top-down review of all anti-coal regulations issued by the Obama Administration.August 8, 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump pledged to the American people: We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.GETTING GOVERNMENT OUT OF THE WAY: President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on all Americans, their pocketbooks, and their businesses.President Trump has required that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated.President Trump has placed a moratorium on all new regulations by executive departments and agencies that are not compelled by Congress or public safety.President Trump directed the Commerce Department to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturing and to reduce regulatory burdens on domestic manufacturers.President Trump signed an Executive Order expediting the environmental review and approval processes for domestic infrastructure projects.President Trump signed legislation to eliminate a costly regulation that threatened to put domestic extraction companies and their employees at an unfair disadvantage.President Trump directed the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a full review of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to ensure associated, burdensome regulations receive proper scrutiny.President Trump ordered re-examination of the Department of Labors fiduciary rule, to make certain that it does not harm Americans as they save for retirement.",20619.77,7.9099999999998545,5814.9,-4.539999999999964,2347.22,-2.0300000000002

175,2017-02-16,Remarks by President Trump in Press Conference ,"East Room12:55 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for Secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student. Former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He's a member, and has been a member, of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed -- did very, very well. And so Alex, I've wished him the best. We just spoke. And he's going to be -- I think he'll be a tremendous Secretary of Labor.And also, as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved -- weeks late, I have to say that. Weeks, weeks late. Office of Management and Budget. And he will be, I think, a fantastic addition. Paul Singer has just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the anti-Trump, or, as they say, ""Never Trump."" And Paul just left and he's given us his total support. And it's all about unification. We're unifying the party, and hopefully we're going to be able to unify the country. It's very important to me. I've been talking about that for a long time, but it's very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he's a very strong ally. And I appreciate that.I think I'll say a few words, and then we'll take some questions. And I had this time -- we've been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible. Just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we've done some really good work. We're very proud of that. And then right after that, you prepare yourselves and we'll do some questions -- unless you have no questions. That's always a possibility. I'm here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I dont think there's ever been a President elected who, in this short period of time, has done what we've done. A new Rasmussen poll, in fact -- because the people get it; much of the media doesnt get it. They actually get it, but they dont write it -- let's put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is -- to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, oh, that's good. Now it means that's good for jobs. Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States and big league -- Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I'm making this presentation directly to the American people with the media present, which is an honor to have you this morning, because many of our nation's reporters and folks will not tell you the truth and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that's possible. Maybe it's not, and that's okay too.Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D.C., along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular, speaks not for the people but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we dont talk about it, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people -- tremendous disservice. We have to talk about it to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.I ran for President to represent the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking, and really talking, on this very entrenched power structure, and what we're doing is we're talking about the power structure, we're talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through to oftentimes distort -- not all the time -- and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say; they're honest and fantastic. But much of it is not -- the distortion. And we'll talk about it, and you'll be able to ask me questions about it.But we're not going to let it happen, because I'm here again to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess -- its a mess -- at home and abroad. A mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country. You see whats going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places -- low-pay, low-wages. Mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East, a disaster. North Korea -- well take care of it, folks. We're going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know I inherited a mess. Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we've already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders -- much of it you've covered -- to move forward toward stability, security, and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many.We've had great conversations with the United Kingdom -- and meetings -- Israel, Mexico, Japan, China, and Canada. Really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We've even developed a new council with Canada to promote womens business leaders and entrepreneurs. It's very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community, headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis -- hes over there now, working very hard -- to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, and now its in large sections of the world. They've spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer. Another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whos totally taken advantage of our previous administration. And they're the worlds top sponsor of terrorism. And we're not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And its not properly solved now. Its one of the worst agreements Ive ever seen drawn by anybody. Ive ordered plans to begin for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Ive had great support from the Senate. Ive had great support from Congress generally. We've pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military. And I will tell you that is my -- I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we're about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on Earth in our military, but they don't have the right equipment. And their equipment is old. I used it, I talked about it at every stop. Depleted -- its depleted. It wont be depleted for long. And I think one of the reasons Im standing here instead of other people is that, frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war. We really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, Im keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we're having strong borders. Well, that's what Ive been talking about for a year and a half -- strong borders. They're so surprised -- ""oh, you're having strong borders."" Well, that's what Ive been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lie to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things Im doing probably arent popular, but they're necessary for security and for other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests, which is more important to many politicians.Im here following through on what I pledged to do. That's all Im doing. I put it out before the American people. Got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasnt supposed to get 222. They said theres no way to get 222; 230 is impossible. Two hundred and seventy, which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they've never seen before. So that's the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media is trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made, and they're not happy about it for whatever reason. But a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, Ill be in Melbourne, Florida, five oclock on Saturday, and I heard -- just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos. Chaos! Yet, it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine, despite the fact that I cant get my Cabinet approved, and theyre outstanding people. Like Senator Dan Coates whose there -- one of the most respected men of the Senate -- he cant get approved. How do you not approve him? Hes been a colleague, highly respected -- brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it -- but waiting for approval.So we have a wonderful group of people thats working very hard, thats being very much misrepresented about, and we cant let that happen. So if the Democrats, who have -- all you have to do is look at where they are right now -- the only thing they can do is delay, because theyve screwed things up royally, believe me.Let me list to you some of the things that weve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. I got here with no Cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. So well go over just some of them, and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks coming. Weve withdrawn from the job-killing disaster known as Trans-Pacific Partnership. Were going to make trade deals, but were going to have one-on-one deals -- bilateral. Were going to have one-on-one deals.Weve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing, and called for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure, and that means plants, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit -- its many, many years. And then at the end of the process -- they spend tens of millions of dollars on nonsense -- and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me, but its going to be a quick rejection. It's not going to take years. But mostly, its going to be an acceptance. We want plants built, and we want factories built, and we want the jobs. We dont want the jobs going to other countries. Weve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. Weve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. Weve issued a game-changing new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody has ever seen regulations like we have. If you go to other countries and you look at industries they have, and you say, let me see your regulations, and they're a fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. Its very important to me. But you dont need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing.Weve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. Weve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation -- take a look at Chicago and others -- taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. Weve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. Were becoming a drug-infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars, and were not going to let it happen any longer. Weve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe, and are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border. Met with General, now Secretary, Kelly yesterday and were starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall, and its going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down, just like it has on everything else Ive negotiated for the government. And were going to have a wall that works. Were not going to have a wall like they have now, which is either nonexistent or a joke. Weve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and weve ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release, no matter who you are -- release. Weve begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers, and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. The court system has not made it easy for us. And we've even created a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, of which there are many.Weve taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. Though parts of our necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by a judges, in my opinion, incorrect and unsafe ruling, our administration is working night and day to keep you safe -- including reporters safe -- and is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. And I keep my campaign promises. And our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are. I can tell you that.Extreme vetting will be put in place, and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I've heard 80 percent -- I find that hard to believe; that's just a number I heard -- that they're overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is, frankly, in turmoil. But we are appealing that and we are going further. We're issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country, so we'll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that. At the same time, we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people, and that will be done some time next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part.We've also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines -- thousands and thousands of jobs -- and put new ""Buy American"" measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen. We want them to use American steel. And they're willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn't say that. And I'm reading the order, I'm saying, why aren't we using American steel? And they said, that's a good idea. We put it in.To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D.C. I've started by imposing a five-year lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It's a disaster. You can say, oh, Obamacare -- I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they're not the Republican people that our representatives are representing. So we've begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back. We're bringing our jobs back to this country big league. It's already happening, but big league.I've also worked to install a Cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You've seen what they've done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great Cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson -- he's out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people.Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now, look, fair trade -- not free -- fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, we're not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us, almost. I may be able to find a couple that don't. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do. Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat-Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2,000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know -- you were here. General Motors, likewise, committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn't get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I'm announcing would never have come here. Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10,000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10,000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more. Many more. These are a few that we're naming.Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades -- decades and decades and decades, folks. And were not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen.And one more thing. I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution -- highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats -- you may not see that, but hell get there one way or the other. But he should get there the old-fashioned way, and he should get those votes.This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it -- there has never been a presidency thats done so much in such a short period of time. And we havent even started the big work that starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So were just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p.m. I hope to see you there. And with that, Id just say, God bless America, and lets take some questions.Mara. Mara, go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference.Q  Did you fire Mike Flynn?THE PRESIDENT: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who -- there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didnt have to do that, because what he did wasnt wrong, what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. Thats the real problem. And you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a fake news, fabricated deal to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats, and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this -- they know nothing about it. They werent in Russia, they never made a phone call to Russia, they never received a phone call. Its all fake news. Its all fake news.The nice thing is I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal, Mara -- and I think its very important -- the illegal giving out classified information. And let me just tell you, it was given out, like, so much. Ill give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very confidential, classified call, but I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well, thats -- I spoke to the President of Mexico, had a good call. All of a sudden its out for the world to see. Its supposed to be secret. Its supposed to be either confidential or classified in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this, and Im saying -- the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is, how does the press get this information thats classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because its an illegal process, and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But, more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves. Really ashamed.Yes, go ahead.Q  Why did you keep your Vice President in the dark for almost two weeks?THE PRESIDENT: Because when I looked at the information, I said, I dont think he did anything wrong. If anything, he did something right. He was coming into office, he looked at the information. He said, huh, thats fine, thats what theyre supposed to do. Theyre supposed to be -- and he didnt just call Russia. He called and spoke to, both ways -- I think there were 30-some-odd countries. Hes doing the job.You know, he was just doing his job. The thing is he didnt tell our Vice President properly, and then he said he didnt remember. So either way, it wasnt very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position, and that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision.But he didnt tell the Vice President of the United States the facts, and then he didnt remember. And that just wasnt acceptable to me. Yes.Q  President Trump, since you brought up Russia, I'm looking for some clarification here. During the campaign, did anyone from your team communicate with members of the Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations? THE PRESIDENT: Well, the failing New York Times wrote a big, long front-page story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was -- its a joke. And the people mentioned in the story -- I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They werent even a part, really -- I mean, they were such a minor part -- I hadnt spoken to them. I think the one person, I dont think Ive ever spoken to him. I dont think Ive ever met him. And he actually said he was a very low-level member of, I think, a committee for a short period of time. I dont think I ever met him. Now, its possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I dont think I ever met him. I didnt talk to him, ever. And he thought it was a joke.The other person said he never spoke to Russia, never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that hed represented various countries, but I don't think he represented Russia -- but knew that he represented various countries. That's what he does. I mean, people know that. That's Mr. Manafort, who's, by the way -- who's, by the way, a respected man. Hes a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine, or Ukraine government, or somebody. But everybody -- people knew that. Everybody knew that. So these people -- and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don't print it because that's not good for their stories. So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don't have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders -- almost all other leaders from almost all other countries. So that's the extent.Russia is fake news. Russia -- this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they're there -- because we have our new people going in place right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo is now taking control of the CIA. James Comey at FBI. Dan Coats is waiting to be approved. I mean, he is a senator, and a highly respected one. And hes still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in. And just while you're at, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New Timess story yesterday. And it talked about -- you saw it, front page. So, Director of National Intelligence just put out -- acting -- a statement: Any suggestion that the United States intelligence community -- this was just given to us -- is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the President and his national security team is not true.So they took this front-page story out of The Wall Street Journal -- top -- and they just wrote the story is not true. And Ill tell you something, Ill be honest -- because I sort of enjoy this back and forth, and I guess I have all my life, but Ive never seen more dishonest media than, frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that I never get phone calls from the media. How do they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me? Or how do they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page? That was like that story they wrote about the women and me -- front page. Big massive story. And it was nasty.And then they called. They said, ""We never said that. We like Mr. Trump."" They called up my office -- we like Mr. Trump; we never said that. And it was totally -- they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you -- totally misrepresented. I said, give us a retraction. They never gave us a retraction. And, frankly, I then went on to other things.Go ahead. Q  Mr. President --THE PRESIDENT: You okay?Q  I am. Just wanted to get untangled. Very simply, you said today that you had the biggest electoral margins since Ronald Reagan with 304 or 306 electoral votes. In fact, President Obama got 365 in 2008.THE PRESIDENT: Well, Im talking about Republican. Yes.Q  President Obama, 332. George H.W. Bush, 426 when he won as President. So why should Americans trust -- THE PRESIDENT: Well, no, I was told -- I was given that information. I don't know. I was just given. We had a very, very big margin.Q  I guess my question is, why should Americans trust you when you have accused the information they receive of being fake when you're providing information that's fake?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I don't know. I was given that information. I was given -- actually, Ive seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that?Q  You're the President. THE PRESIDENT: Okay, thank you. That's a good answer. Yes.Q  Mr. President, thank you so much. Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn -- there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you have the transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly Ambassador Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What evidence did you weigh to determine there was no wrong doing? And further than that, sir, you've said on a couple of occasions this morning that you were going to aggressively pursue the sources of these leaks.THE PRESIDENT: We are.Q  Can we ask what you're doing to do? And also, we've heard about a review of the intelligence community headed by Stephen Feinberg. What can you tell us about that?THE PRESIDENT: Well, first of all, about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon Mike Pompeo and James Comey, and they're in position. So I hope that well be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man. And he has offered his services, and its something we may take advantage of. But I don't think well need that at all because of the fact that I think that we're going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own.As far as the general is concerned, when I first heard about it, I said, huh, that doesn't sound wrong. My counsel came -- Don McGahn, White House Counsel -- and he told me, and I asked him, and he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn't think anything is wrong. He really didn't think -- it was really what happened after that, but he didn't think anything was done wrong. I didn't either, because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it. I said, well, I don't see -- to me, he was doing the job. The information was provided by -- who I don't know -- Sally Yates -- and I was a little surprised because I said, doesn't sound like he did anything wrong there. But he did something wrong with respect to the Vice President, and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as the actual making the call -- in fact, I've watched various programs and I've read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. At first, everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job.So -- and I do -- and, by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he's a fine man. Yes, Jon.Q  On the leaks, sir --THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead, finish off, then I'll get you, Jon.Q  Sorry, what will you do on the leaks? You have said twice today --THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we're looking at it very, very seriously. I've gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies, and we're -- I've actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They're put out by people either in agencies. I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don't have our people in because we can't get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved in Justice, as an example. So we are looking into that very seriously. It's a criminal act. You know what I say -- when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked. Because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment. When I was called out on Mexico, I was -- honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said, you know, it doesn't make sense, that won't happen. But that wasn't that important to call, it was fine. I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world -- the President who is a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said, that's terrible that it was leaked but it wasn't that important. But then I said, what happens when I'm dealing with the problem of North Korea? What happens when I'm dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information -- very important, very -- I mean, at the highest level, are you going to be reporting about that too?So I don't want classified information getting out to the public. And in a way, that was almost a test. So I'm dealing with Mexico. I'm dealing with Argentina. We were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the Washington Post and gets put into the New York Times. And I'm saying, what's going to happen when I'm dealing on the Middle East? What's going to happen when I'm dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We've got to stop it. That's why it's a criminal penalty.Yes, Jon.Q  Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to get you to clarify just a very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And, on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks?THE PRESIDENT: Well, the leaks are real. You're the one that wrote about them and reported them. I mean, the leaks are real. You know what they said -- you saw it. And the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do -- and I hope we can correct it, because there is nobody I have more respect for -- well, maybe a little bit -- than reporters, than good reporters. It's very important to me, and especially in this position. It's very important. I don't mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it's true. And over a course of time, I'll make mistakes and you'll write badly and I'm okay with that. But I'm not okay when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN -- it's so much anger and hatred and just the hatred. I don't watch it anymore because it's very good -- he's saying no. It's okay, Jim. It's okay, Jim. Youll have your chance. But I watch others too. Youre not the only one, so dont feel badly.But I think it should be straight. I think it should be -- I think it would be, frankly, more interesting. I know how good everybodys ratings are right now, but I think that actually would be -- I think that it would actually be better. People -- I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think thats right. I dont know, Peter, is that one right? Because you know, I think they have lower -- I heard, lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it. Id appreciate it. Again, I dont mind bad stories when its true. But we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. I think were setting a record, or close to a record in the time of approval of a Cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When Im looking -- some of them had them approved immediately. Im going forever, and I still have a lot of people that were waiting for.And thats all theyre doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that hes got over there, and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And you know, I think theyd be better served by approving and making sure that theyre happy and everybody is good. And sometimes, I mean -- I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way. And thats okay. Thats fine.But I think they would be much better served, Jon, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it.Yeah, go ahead, Jim.Q  The first part of my question on contacts. Do you definitively say that nobody --THE PRESIDENT: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there. I have no anything.Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give -- theyre not giving classified information. Theyre giving stuff -- what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates -- which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates.Can you imagine -- seriously, can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair, okay? He should be put in the electric chair. You would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, okay? Maybe not you, Jon.Yes, well do you next, Jim. Ill do you next. Yes?Q  Thank you, Mr. President. I just want to clarify one other thing.THE PRESIDENT: Sure.Q  Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss the sanctions with the Russian ambassador?THE PRESIDENT: No, I didnt. No, I didnt. Q  (Inaudible.) (Off mic.)THE PRESIDENT: No, I didnt. Q  Did you fire him because (inaudible) --THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me -- no, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence, very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So it certainly would have been okay with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasnt doing it. I didnt direct him but I would have directed him because thats his job.And it came out that way -- and, in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job. And I agreed with him. And since then Ive watched many other people say that.No, I didnt direct him, but I would have directed him if he didnt do it, okay? Jim.Q  Mr. President, thank you very much. And just for the record, we dont hate you, I dont hate you. If you could pass that along. THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Well, ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job, okay?Q  If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far, sir. THE PRESIDENT: Well, not too many. We do have other people. You do have other people, and your ratings arent as good as some of the other people that are waiting.Q  They're pretty good right now, actually.THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Go ahead, Jim.Q  If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that at one point.THE PRESIDENT: I was okay with it.Q  You said you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30,000 emails. Im wondering, sir, if you --THE PRESIDENT: Well, she was actually missing 33,000, and then that got extended with a whole pile after that, but thats okay.Q  Maybe my numbers are off a little bit too.THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but I did say 30,000, but it was actually higher than that.Q  If I may ask you, sir, it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged in the campaign.THE PRESIDENT: Okay, fair question. Ready?Q  So if I may ask you that -- if I may ask a follow-up --THE PRESIDENT: No, no, but are you -- let me do one at a time. Do you mind?Q  Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT: All right. So in one case youre talking about highly classified information. In the other case youre talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this: If John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasnt classified information. But in one case youre talking about classified. Regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong -- at my suggestion -- and I give Reince great credit for this -- at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism. I dont want to be hacked. And we did that, and you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed.The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked, and terrible things came. And the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so -- they were -- when I heard some of those things, I said -- I picked up the papers the next morning, I said, oh, this is going to front page. It wasnt even in the papers.Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been the headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions for the debate, and she should have reported herself. Why didnt Hillary Clinton announce that, ""Im sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that its inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job""?Q  And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl was asking you about -- you said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don't understand. It seems that there is a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake?THE PRESIDENT: Well, the reporting is fake. Look, look --Q  And if I may ask -- I just want to ask one other question. THE PRESIDENT: Jim, you know what it is? Heres the thing. The public isnt -- they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don't know if its true or false because they're not involved. Im involved. Ive been involved with this stuff all my life. But Im involved. So I know when you're telling the truth or when you're not. I just see many, many untruthful things. And I tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word tone. The tone is such hatred. Im really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such -- I do get good ratings, you have to admit that. The tone is such hatred. I watched this morning a couple of the networks, and I have to say Fox & Friends in the morning, they're very honorable people. They're very -- not because they're good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That's all I can say. Its the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look -- the hatred. I mean, sometimes -- sometimes somebody gets --Q  (Off mic.)THE PRESIDENT: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 oclock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive anti-Trump. And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth, the hatred coming from other people on your network.Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. Im amazed by it. And I just think youd be a lot better off -- I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, its brutal. Now, theyll take this news conference. Im actually having a very good time, okay? But theyll take this news conference -- don't forget that's the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day.Q  (Off mic.)THE PRESIDENT: No, that's how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win by people listening to you people, that's for sure.But I am having a good time. Tomorrow they will say, Donald Trump rants and raves at the press. Im not ranting and raving. Im just telling you, you're dishonest people. But -- but Im not ranting and raving. I love this. Im having a good time doing it. But tomorrow the headlines are going to be: Donald Trump Rants and Raves. Im not ranting and raving.Q  If I may just --THE PRESIDENT: Go ahead.Q  One more follow-up because --THE PRESIDENT: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Q  Just because of this --THE PRESIDENT: Peter, should I have let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down. Q  Just because of the attack --THE PRESIDENT: Well get it. Q  Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir --THE PRESIDENT: Im changing it from fake news, though.Q  Doesn't that undermine --THE PRESIDENT: Very fake news now. (Laughter.)Q  But arent you --THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go ahead. Q  Real news, Mr. President. Real news.THE PRESIDENT: And you're not related to our new --Q  I am not related, sir, no. (Laughter.) I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say.THE PRESIDENT: I looked -- you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta.Q  Im sure you checked that out, sir.THE PRESIDENT: No, I checked it. I said -- they said, no, sir. I said, do me a favor, go back and check the family tree. Q  But arent you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people's faith in the First Amendment freedom of the press, the press in this country when you call stories you don't like fake news? Why not just say its a story I don't like?THE PRESIDENT: I do that.Q  When you call it fake news, you're undermining confidence --THE PRESIDENT: No, I do that. No, no, I do that.Q  -- in our news media.THE PRESIDENT: Heres the thing. Q  Isnt that important?THE PRESIDENT: Okay, I understand -- and you're right about that except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes Ill say, wow, that's going to be a great story, and Ill get killed. I know whats good and bad. Id be a pretty good reporter -- not as good as you. But I know whats good. I know whats bad. And when they change it and make it really bad -- something that should be positive. Sometimes something that should be very positive, theyll make okay. Theyll even make it negative. So I understand it because Im there. I know what was said. I know who is saying it. Im there. So its very important to me. Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that its so important to the public to get an honest press. The press -- the public doesn't believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that, I don't know. But they don't believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster, I would be your biggest fan in the world -- including bad stories about me. But if you go -- as an example, you're CNN -- I mean, its story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing: Chaos. Theres zero chaos. We are running -- this is a fine-tuned machine. And Reince happens to be doing a good job. But half of his job is putting out lies by the press. I said to him yesterday, this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don't talk about the real subject, which is illegal leaks. But I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And Im saying, heres my Chief of Staff, a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, we won the election, right? We won the presidency. We got some senators. We got some -- all over the country, you take a look, hes done a great job.And I said to myself, you know -- and I said to somebody that was in the room -- I said, you take a look at Reince, hes working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. They're fake. They're not true. And isn't that a shame, because he'd rather be working on health care. He'd rather be working on tax reform, Jim. I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there's a certain bias, maybe by Jeff or somebody -- for whatever reason. And I understand that. But you've got to be at least a little bit fair. And that's why the public sees it -- they see it. They see it's not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart. They understand it. Okay, yeah, go ahead. Q  We have no doubt that your latest story is (inaudible). But for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over these last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn't fake news? And secondly --THE PRESIDENT: I think they don't believe it. I don't think the public would. That's why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don't think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I'm here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing -- that's a ruse. That's a ruse. And, by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now, tomorrow you'll say, Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible. It's not terrible -- it's good.We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? It's this thing called nuclear weapons and other things. Like, lots of things are done with uranium, including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn't do anything for Russia. I've done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember, with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks? Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton -- that was a reset. Remember? It said ""reset.""Now, if I do that, oh, I'm a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that's a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who is going to be meeting with them shortly. And I told him, I said, I know politically it's probably not good for me. Hey, the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that's 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone in this country is going to say, oh, it's so great. That's not great. That's not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia.Now, you've had a lot of Presidents that haven't taken that tact. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can -- now, I love to negotiate things. I do it really well and all that stuff, but it's possible I won't be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people -- the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said, you know -- he's sitting behind his desk and he's saying, you know, I see what's going on in the United States, I follow it closely; it's got to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he's got with this fake story. Okay? And that's a shame. Because if we could get along with Russia -- and, by the way, China and Japan and everyone -- if we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing.Q  Tax reform --Q  Mr. President, since you --THE PRESIDENT: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We're doing Obamacare -- we're in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It's not like -- frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the health care sooner. So we'll be submitting health care sometime in early March, mid-March. And after that, we're going to come up -- and we're doing very well on tax reform.Yes.Q  Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let's talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as President of the United States.THE PRESIDENT: Okay.Q  You mentioned the vessel, the spy vessel, off the coast of the United States.THE PRESIDENT: Not good.Q  There was a ballistic missile test that many interpreted as a violation --THE PRESIDENT: Not good.Q  -- of the agreement between the two countries. And a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer. THE PRESIDENT: Not good.Q  I listened to you during the campaign --THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me, excuse me, when did it happen? It happened when -- if you were Putin right now, you would say, hey, we're back to the old games with the United States. There's no way Trump can ever do a deal with us because the -- you have to understand, if I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, oh, isn't that wonderful. But I know you well enough. Then you would say, oh, he was too tough, he shouldn't have done that. Look, of all --Q  I'm just trying to find out your orientation to those --THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second. Q  I'm just trying to find out what you're doing to do about them, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he's not going to be able to make a deal with me because it's politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries to reset, it failed. They all tried. But I'm different than those people.Go ahead.Q  How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them?THE PRESIDENT: Just the way I said it.Q  Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal?THE PRESIDENT: I have. I have. And I'm so beautifully represented. I'm so honored that the Senate approved him. He's going to be fantastic.Yes, I think that I've already --Q  Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir?THE PRESIDENT: No, I don't think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can't make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can't believe I'm saying I'm a politician, but I guess that's what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we're not going to make a deal.Now, I don't know that we're going to make a deal. I don't know. We might, we might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough -- the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what, I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world.If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along -- and don't forget, we're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There's no upside. We're a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I've been briefed. And I can tell you, one thing about a briefing that we're allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it: Nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They're a very powerful nuclear country and so are we.If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.Q  So when you say they're not good, do you mean that they are --THE PRESIDENT: Who did I say is not good?Q  No, when I read off the three things that have recently happened and each one of them you said they're not good.THE PRESIDENT: No, it's not good, but they happened.Q  But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine this countrys ability to work with Russia?THE PRESIDENT: They all happened recently, and I understand what theyre doing, because theyre doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe Im not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I dont, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? Okay.But I tell you one thing: She tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all the valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say Im close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. Shes close to Russia. I gave -- you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing.Q  Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations?THE PRESIDENT: Im not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I dont talk about military response. I dont say Im going into Mosul in four months. ""We are going to attack Mosul in four months."" Then three months later: ""We are going to attack Mosul in one month."" ""Next week, we are going to attack Mosul."" In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I dont talk about military, and I dont talk about certain other things. Youre going to be surprised to hear that. And, by the way, my whole campaign, Id say that. So I dont have to tell you --Q  There will be a response?THE PRESIDENT: I dont want to be one of these guys that say, Yes, heres what were going to do. I dont have to do that.Q  There will be a -- in other words, there will be a response, Mr. President? THE PRESIDENT: I dont have to tell you what Im going to do in North Korea. Wait a minute. I dont have to tell you what Im going to do in North Korea. And I dont have to tell you what Im going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldnt know. And eventually you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. So when you ask me, what am I going to do with the ship -- the Russian ship, as an example -- Im not going to tell you. But hopefully, I wont have to do anything. But Im not going to tell you. Okay.Q  Thanks.Q  Can I just ask you -- thank you very much, Mr. President -- the Trump --THE PRESIDENT: Where are you from?Q  BBC.THE PRESIDENT: Okay. Heres another beauty.Q  Thats a good line. Impartial, free, and fair.THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, sure.Q  Mr. President --THE PRESIDENT: Just like CNN, right?Q  Mr. President, on the travel ban -- we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban, would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government, that fine-tuned --THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, I do. I do.  And let me tell you about the travel --Q  Were there any mistakes in that?THE PRESIDENT: Wait, wait, wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban, but we had a bad court. We got a bad decision. We had a court thats been overturned -- again, maybe wrong, but I think its 80 percent of the time. A lot. We had a bad decision. Were going to keep going with that decision. Were going to put in a new executive order next week sometime. But we had a bad decision. Thats the only thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice buses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that, the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect.Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order but said one thing -- and I said this to my people: Give them a one-month period of time. But General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, said, if you do that, all these people will come in, in the month -- the bad ones. You do agree, there are bad people out there, right? Theyre not everybody thats like you. You have some bad people out there. So Kelly said, you cant do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it, I said, wow, never thought of it. I said, how about one week? He said, no good. You got to do it immediately, because if you do it immediately, they dont have time to come in. Now, nobody ever reports that, but thats why we did it quickly.Now, if would have done it a month, everything would have been perfect. The problems is we would have wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives, because a lot of bad people would have come into our country.Now, in the meantime, weve vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help, and we need help by getting that executive order passed.Q  Just a brief follow-up. And if its so urgent, why not introduce --THE PRESIDENT: Yes, go ahead.Q  Thank you. I just was hoping that we could get a yes- or-no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I told you, General Flynn obviously was dealing. So thats one person. But he was dealing -- as he should have been --Q  During the election?THE PRESIDENT: No, no, nobody that I know of.Q  So youre not aware of any contacts during the course of the election?THE PRESIDENT: Look, look, how many times do I have to answer this question? Q  Can you just say yes or no on it?THE PRESIDENT: Russia is a ruse. Yeah, I know you have to get up and ask a question, so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia, havent made a phone call to Russia in years. Dont speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldnt, I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election -- I told you this -- and he called me on the inauguration, and a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one -- lasted for a pretty long period of time. Im sure you probably get it because it was classified, so Im sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does. Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now, people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that -- whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that.Q  But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election?THE PRESIDENT: I have -- you know what, he said no. I can only tell you what he -- now, he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, whos a good man also, by the way -- Paul Manafort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time.How much longer should we stay here, folks? Five more minutes, is that okay? Five? Q  Mr. President, on national security --THE PRESIDENT: Wait, lets see, whos -- I want to find a friendly reporter. Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait, wait -- watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. Go ahead.Q  So, first of all, my name is (inaudible) from (inaudible) Magazine. And (inaudible). I havent seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or any of the -- anyone on your staff of being anti-Semitic. We have an understanding of (inaudible).THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.Q  However, what we are concerned about, and what we havent really heard be addressed is an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it. There have been reports out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people who are committing anti-Semitic acts or threatening to --THE PRESIDENT: You see, he said he was going to ask a very simple, easy question. And its not. Its not. Not a simple question, not a fair question. Okay, sit down. I understand the rest of your question. So heres the story, folks. Number one, I am the least anti-Semitic person that youve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism -- the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican. Q  (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: Quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about -- he was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question. So you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something -- that I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me -- and you heard the Prime Minister, you heard Netanyahu yesterday -- did you hear him, Bibi? He said, Ive known Donald Trump for a long time, and then he said, forget it.So you should take that, instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that.Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead.Q  Thank you. Im Lisa from the PBS --THE PRESIDENT: See, it just shows you about the press, but thats the way the press is. Q  Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Desjardins from the PBS Newshour.THE PRESIDENT: Good.Q  On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you planned for next week, even its broad outlines? Will it be focused on specific countries?THE PRESIDENT: Its a very fair question.Q  And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration, what is your plan? Do you plan to continue that program or to end it?THE PRESIDENT: Were going to show great heart. DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, its one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases -- not in all cases. In some of the cases theyre having DACA and theyre gang members and theyre drug dealers too. But you have some absolutely incredible kids -- I would say mostly -- they were brought here in such a way -- it's a very, very tough subject.We are going to deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don't forget, and I have to convince them that what I'm saying is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that.But the DACA situation is a very, very -- it's a very difficult thing for me. Because, you know, I love these kids. I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do. And you know, the law is rough. I'm not talking about new laws. I'm talking the existing law is very rough. It's very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to what I consider to be a very bad decision, but we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways more. But we're tailoring it now to the decision. We have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new executive order is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. Okay?Q  Mr. President, Melania Trump announced the reopening of the White House Visitors Office. THE PRESIDENT: Yes.Q  And she does a lot of great work for the country as well. Can you tell us a little bit about what First Lady Melania Trump does for the country? And there is a unique level of interest in your administration, so by opening the White House Visitors Office, what does that mean to you?THE PRESIDENT: Now, that's what I call a nice question. That is very nice. Who are you with?Q  (Inaudible.)THE PRESIDENT: Good. I'm going to start watching. Thank you very much.Melania is terrific. She was here last night. We had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife, who is, by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election as you know, the Cuban people, Americans. And I think that Melania is going to be outstanding. That's right, she just opened up the Visitors Center -- in other words, touring of the White House. She, like others that she's working with, feels very, very strongly about women's issues, women's difficulties, very, very strongly. And she's a very, very strong advocate. I think she's a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens because she gets so unfairly maligned. The things they say -- I've known her for a long time. She was a very successful person. She was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn't even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you'll ever find. And the things they say -- and I've known her for a long time -- the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she's been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies.I'd just tell you this: I think she's going to be a fantastic First Lady. She's going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working with her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they're not doing this for money. They're not doing this for pay. They're doing this because they feel it, both of them. And Melania goes back and forth, and after Barron finishes school -- because it's hard to take a child out of school with a few months left -- she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. Thank you. That's a very nice question.Go ahead.Q  Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Oh, this is going to be a bad question but that's okay.Q  No, it's not going to be a bad question.THE PRESIDENT: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television.Q  Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you -- you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign.THE PRESIDENT: Fix the inner cities, yes.Q  Fixing the inner cities. What will be that fix and your urban agenda, as well as your HBCU executive order that's coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn't bad, was it?THE PRESIDENT: That was very professional and very good.Q  I'm very professional.THE PRESIDENT: We'll be announcing the order in a little while, and I'd rather let the order speak for itself. But it will be something I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we'll talk to you about that after we do the announcement.As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it's probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did much higher than people thought I was going to get and I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And, by the way, if I might add, including the women's vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get.So we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities having to do with education, having to do with crime. We're going to try and fix as quickly as possible -- you know it takes a long time. It's taken 100 years or more for some of these places to evolve, and they evolved many of them very badly.But were going to be working very hard on health and health care; very, very hard on education. And also, were going to working in a stringent way, and a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places, and its so sad when you look at the crime. You have people -- and Ive seen this, and Ive sort of witnessed it. In fact, in two cases, I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. Theyre living in hell. We cant let that happen. So were going to be very, very strong.Its a great question, and its a very difficult situation, because its been many, many years. Its been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part are stuck there -- Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities, and theyre living in hell.I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. Theres one Chicago thats incredible, luxurious and all, and safe. Theres another Chicago thats worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk about, and that you talk about every night on the newscasts. So were going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities.Q  Well, when you say -- when you say the inner cities, are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as your --THE PRESIDENT: Am I going include who?Q  Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, as well as --THE PRESIDENT: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? Do you want to set up the meeting?Q  No, no, no.THE PRESIDENT: Are they friends of yours?Q  Im just a reporter. THE PRESIDENT: No, go ahead, set up the meeting.Q  I know some of them, but Im sure theyre watching right now.THE PRESIDENT: Lets go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think its great -- the Congressional Black Caucus. I think its great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings, and he was all excited, and then he said, oh, I cant move, it might be bad for me politically, I cant have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him, and he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone. Very nice guy.Q  I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well.THE PRESIDENT: He wanted it. But we called, called, called, called -- they cant make a meeting with him. Every day, I walked in, I said, I would like to meet with him. Because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that -- some other lightweight -- he was probably told -- he was probably told, dont meet with Trump, its bad politics. And thats part of the problem of this country.Okay, one more. Go ahead.Q  Yes, Mr. President, two questions --THE PRESIDENT: No, no. One question. Two, we cant handle. This room cant handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two.Q  (Inaudible) it's not about your personality or your beliefs. Were talking about (inaudible) around the country, some of it by supporters in your name. What do you --THE PRESIDENT: And some of it -- and can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You dont think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs youll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, theyre put up by the other side, and you think its like playing it straight. No. But you have some of those signs, and some of that anger is caused by the other side. Theyll do signs and theyll do drawings that are inappropriate. It wont be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. Okay.Go ahead.Q  You are the President now. What are you going to do about it?THE PRESIDENT: Who is that? Where is that? Oh, stand up. You can --Q  What are you going to do about the tensions that have been discussed?THE PRESIDENT: Oh, Im working on it. No, Im working on it very hard. Q  Are you going to give a speech?THE PRESIDENT: No, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years, and long before that, in all fairness to President Obama. Long before President Obama, we have had a very divided. I didnt come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here. Were going to work on it very hard. One of the questions that was asked -- I thought it was a very good question -- was about the inner cities. I mean, thats part of it. But were going to work on education. Were going to work on lack -- you know, were going to stop -- were going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials. Were going to try and stop crime. Were not going to try and stop, were going to stop crime.But its very important to me. But this isnt Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama, and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try -- I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much. Its a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause.)END 2:13 P.M.

176,2017-02-16,President Donald J. Trump Nominates R. Alexander Acosta to be Secretary of Labor,"Today, President Donald J. Trump announced his intent to nominate R. Alexander Acosta for the position of Secretary of Labor. Mr. Acosta is currently Dean of Florida International University Law School.Mr. Acosta has had a long and distinguished career in public service. He has served in three Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed positions, including as a member of the National Labor Relations Board. Mr. Acosta was the first Hispanic to hold the rank of Assistant Attorney General and went on to serve as the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Since 2013, Mr. Acosta has also served as Chairman of U.S. Century Bank, the largest domestically owned Hispanic community bank in Florida.Throughout his career, Alex Acosta has been a passionate advocate for equal opportunity for all Americans, said President Trump. His extensive experience has tremendously impressed me and my team and makes us confident that he will lead the Department of Labor with the utmost competence and determination to support the American worker. The American worker had been forgotten and left behind. That ended when I became President on January 20. Alex is going to be a key part of achieving our goal of revitalizing the American economy, manufacturing, and labor force. I call on the Senate to swiftly confirm this highly qualified and deserving leader so that he can get straight to work for the betterment of the American people.I am deeply grateful and honored for the opportunity to serve my country, Mr. Acosta said. I thank the President and his staff for their confidence in me and I am eager to work tirelessly on behalf of the American worker.",20619.77,7.9099999999998545,5814.9,-4.539999999999964,2347.22,-2.0300000000002

We had a little time in between things. So if the press would like to show up -- will anybody show up to that press conference? (Laughter.) Historically, they didn't care about these things.

This was scheduled a long time ago -- some of my very, very early supporters. And I've been your supporter also. We're doing really well.

178,2017-02-16,Remarks by President Trump at Signing of H.J. Resolution 38,"Roosevelt Room3:43 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Okay. We had an exciting news conference before. And some people loved it. I think nobody hated it, but it was -- I think it was very productive. And thank you all for being there, that was very nice. And thank you, all of the wonderful politicians, but -- right, Mitch, especially the miners that are with us, right? So I just want to thank you. Seriously. (Applause.) We appreciate it. We appreciate it very much.And this is our second bill signing this week as we continue to work for the American people. This is H.J. Resolution 38, and that will eliminate another terrible job-killing rule, saving many thousands of American jobs, especially in the mines, which Ive been promising you. The mines are a big deal. Ive had support from some of you folks right from the very beginning, and I wont forget it. I went to West Virginia and I -- we had 17,000, 18,000 people that couldnt get into that big arena, right? You were a few of them. But that was some day and some night. I want to thank Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Rob Bishop -- thank you, Rob -- and Representative Bill Johnson, who worked very hard on this bill. And they really did, they worked very hard. This was a tough one.I also want to thank the great members of Congress who have joined us today. We have a lot of them. In eliminating this rule, I am continuing to keep my promise to the American people to get rid of wasteful regulations that do nothing -- absolutely nothing -- but slow down the economy, hamstring companies, push jobs to other countries -- which is happening all over, although I must tell you, weve stopped it. Youve seen all the factories, all the plants that are moving back. Theyre going back to a lot of places. So you know that, right, fellas? Theyre moving back fast. Ford, General Motors, Fiat -- so many. Very happy.Compliance costs for this rule would be over $50 million a year for the coal industry alone, and its unnecessary. I want to also thank the incredible coal miners who are with us today. I think we can maybe thank them the most, right, for -- political leaders. (Applause.) You folks have put up with a lot. And you know, in other countries, they love their coal. Over here, we havent treated it with the respect it deserves. Even for defense, having that coal is a very important thing for us. So I want to thank you all.This rule were eliminating its a major threat to your jobs, and were going to get rid of that threat immediately. Were going to fight for you like I promised I would in the campaign. And you were very good to me, and Im going to be even better to you, I promise you that.And were going to fight for, also, low-energy prices for all Americans. Theres a spirit of optimism rising across the country. Its going to continue to grow as we sign more and more bills. Were going to make our nation more than competitive -- not just competitive, were going to be more than competitive. And were going to win at many, many industries. Were already starting back with the automobile industry. We had the airline industry in the other day. They have rules and regulations that by the time they get through it, its -- nothing left, and they have to get rid of a lot of jobs. We had a great meeting, actually.We had the unions in. We had the workers in. We had a lot of people in, and they were all very excited about whats happening. And I havent looked yet at the stock market, but its been going up at record clips. We have a tremendous streak going on. And thats only because of the optimism. They feel the optimism. And that optimism is creating a lot of jobs.So its an honor to have everybody with us, and, in particular, the miners. We appreciate everything youve done, fellas. Thank you very much. Would anybody like to say a few words? How about one of the miners saying a few words? I hear these guys all the time. I hear Rand all the time. (Laughter.) Come on. Whod like to -- come on, Mike.MR. NELSON: President Trump, we thank you very much for everything youve done for us. Everything that youre doing for our industry is very much needed. Ive been mining in this industry for 40 years, and this is a very exciting time for our industry. Thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.SENATOR MANCHIN: Tell him where youre from, Mike.MR. NELSON: Im from Morgantown, West Virginia, but I work at the Marion County Coal Company.THE PRESIDENT: How did I do in that area?MR. NELSON: Oh, you did great.

Representing West Virginia as the Senator, and Senator Manchin and I, and we have our congressional delegation here -- Congressman Jenkins, Congressman McKinley, and Congressman Mooney. This is a lifeline to us, and these miners, they mine in West Virginia. Its a source of pride for us as a state that weve been able to power this country, and that weve had the opportunity to provide the energy to this country. And thank you for being a partner with us and being a leader, President Trump, in this. We believe in this, and we believe in your commitment to making sure American miners get back to work. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. (Applause.)SENATOR PAUL: This is a big day for Kentucky. We want to thank President Trump for getting rid of this job-killing regulation. It was scheduled to cost us thousands of more jobs. Nobody seemed to care about Kentucky, but I can promise you, Eastern Kentucky voted about 75 percent for Donald J. Trump. (Applause.)SENATOR MANCHIN: Let me just say something very quickly. Theres not a miner here thats not an environmentalist. So when people say that we dont want to do the right thing -- theres a balance between the environment and the economy, these miners would be the first ones to tell you. Theyre out in the woods, theyre hunting, theyre fishing, theyre doing everything possible. All they want is the respect that -- basically theyve given us the country we have because of the hard work of them and their fathers and grandfathers and all of their family has done. So Im so proud. These are all West Virginians too. Makes it even prouder for all of us. So thank you. God bless you.LEADER MCCONNELL: Well, Mr. President, you know that the last eight years brought a depression -- a depression -- to Eastern Kentucky, and our folks are so excited to have a pro-coal President. And we thank you so much for being on our side. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Anybody else? Come on. Sure. Absolutely. You deserve it.LEADER MCCONNELL: Thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: You deserve it. Come on up.PARTICIPANT: Well, Mr. President, this is an example of what you talked about so much during your campaign. This is what is going to make America great again. This is the legislative branch and you working together to keep the promise that you made to put coal miners back to work and to save the coal industry. If we had not overturned this rule, we were looking at nearly 70,000 jobs across the country, and about 80 percent of our coal reserves being unavailable. So thank you for your willingness to work with us to get this done. Its very, very important to the coal miners of this country and to our electricity grid. Thank you, Mr. President. (Applause.)PARTICIPANT: As a 45-year miner, Im very proud to be in this historic building, and I am very proud to be here with my President of the United States, who keeps his word. And we thank you very much, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Its a great honor. (Applause.)So I want to thank everybody.

Special people. Special workers. Were bringing it back, and were bringing it back fast. We didnt have to wait a long period of time. Its been very few days since Ive been here, and I think this is long ahead of schedule, right? Wouldnt you say even --SENATOR MANCHIN: Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT: Even you might say -- (laughter) -- this is about four years faster than they thought would have happened. So its my honor. And, fellas, go back to work, all right? I think well take them into the Oval Office, right? Lets take them into the Oval Office. Lets have a little tour, okay? Theyve probably been there many times before. (Laughter.) Come on. Come with me. Good. Thank you, everybody. Thank you, very much.AIDE: Sign the bill here.THE PRESIDENT: Oh. (Laughter.)

181,2017-02-17,Remarks by President Trump at Unveiling of Boeing 787 Dreamliner Aircraft,"The Boeing CompanyNorth Charleston, South Carolina1:31 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Dennis. And I have to say, I love South Carolina. I love it. (Applause.) Remember we came down -- all together, we came down, and this was going to be a place that was tough to win, and we won in a landslide. This was a good one. (Applause.) So I want to thank the people of South Carolina and your governor -- tremendous guy. He supported us right from the beginning. So I'd like to thank Governor McMaster for the incredible job. He's right here someplace. Thank you very much. You have been fantastic.And I have to say also, that is one beautiful airplane. (Applause.) Congratulations to the men and women here who have built it. What an amazing piece of art. What an amazing piece of work. Thank you, Dennis, for the invitation to be with you today. You know, in the old days, when I made this speech I got paid a lot of money. Now I have to do it for nothing. (Laughter and applause.) Not a good deal, but that's okay. We love it.Its wonderful to be back in South Carolina, especially with your new governor. Where is Henry? He's around here someplace. Where is he? Stand up, Henry. Proud of you. He helped us so much. (Applause.)And I want to also thank your former governor, Nikki Haley, who is doing an awfully good job for us. (Applause.) She's representing America very well as our ambassador to the United Nations. She is doing a spectacular job. It's early, but she has just been really great.We're here today to celebrate American engineering and American manufacturing. We're also here today to celebrate jobs. Jobs. (Applause.) This plane, as you know, was built right here in the great state of South Carolina. Our goal as a nation must be to rely less on imports and more on products made right here in the U.S.A. (Applause.)Its amazing to think that a little over 113 years ago, next door, in North Carolina, Orville Wright was the first man to sail the skies in a very little airplane. The 1903 Wright Flyer was made of mostly wood and cloth. It was so small that Orville's brother, Wilbur, could not join him on the flight. He was always very upset about that. The flight lasted all of 12 seconds, but it was incredible. That flight was a testament to the American spirit. I see that same spirit everywhere I travel in the country. I saw that spirit all throughout the campaign. We have the greatest people anywhere in the world. We have the greatest spirit, and you just look at what's going on today in our country -- you look at what's happening with jobs. You look at what's happening with plants moving back into our country. All of a sudden, they're coming back. And they're going to be very happy about it, believe me. (Applause.) They're going to be very, very happy. (Applause.)As your President, I am going to do everything I can to unleash the power of the American spirit and to put our great people back to work. (Applause.) This is our mantra: Buy American and Hire American. (Applause.)We want products made in America, made by American hands. You probably saw the Keystone pipeline I approved recently, and the Dakota. And Im getting ready to sign the bill. I said, where is the pipe made? And they told me not here. I said, that's good -- add a little sentence that you have to buy American steel. (Applause.) And you know what? That's the way it is. Its the way its going to be.We are going to fight for every last American job. Weve come a long way since the Wright Brothers and their first flight more than a century ago. Your plane is made of carbon fiber. It seats 330 passengers. Its 18 feet longer than the previous version of the 787. And this airplane can fly for half a day before it touches the ground. The name says it all: Dreamliner. Great name. Our country is all about making dreams come true.Over the last number of years, that hasnt been necessarily the case, but we're going to make it the case again. (Applause.)Thats what we do in America - we dream of things, and then we build them. We turn vision into reality, and we will be doing a lot more of that, believe me, in the months and years to come. (Applause.)I also want to say a word to all of the members of the armed forces who are here with us today in this record crowd. (Applause.)  South Carolina has a long, very, very, proud military tradition and history. We salute all South Carolina military families, and we salute all the men and women who wear the uniform. (Applause.)We are going to fully rebuild our military -- by the way, do you care if we use the F-18 Super Hornets? (Applause.) Or do you only care about -- what do you think? Well -- (jet flies overhead) -- thought that was a Super Hornet. (Laughter.) We are looking seriously at a big order, and well see how that -- you know the problem is that Dennis is a very, very tough negotiator. (Laughter.) But I think we may get there.We're also working on the Air Force One project, which was a difficult project for previous administrations. But it looks like we're getting closer and closer. (Applause.)And were going to ensure that our great service members have the tools, equipment, training and resources they need to get the job done. (Applause.) As George Washington said, being prepared for war is the best way to prevent it. And that's really what it is: The best way to prevent war, being prepared. Peace through strength. We build a military might so great -- and we are going to do that -- that none will dare to challenge it. None. (Applause.)We will ensure our men and women in uniform have the latest, the most cutting edge systems in their arsenal. Right now its not that way. It will be that way very, very soon. Believe me. You will be an important player in this effort.Boeing has built many important aircraft -- including, as I said, the F-18 Super Hornet, the F-15 Strike Eagle, and the Apache helicopter, just to name a few. (Applause.) And Im being very, very serious -- the new Air Force One, that plane, as beautiful as it looks, is 30 years old. Can you believe it? What can look so beautiful at 30? An airplane. (Laughter.) I don't know. Which one do we like better folks? Tell me. (Applause.)On every front, we are going to work for the American people. Nowhere in our focus -- and I mean this so strongly -- and our focus has to be so strong, but my focus has been all about jobs. And jobs is one of the primary reasons Im standing here today as your President, and I will never, ever disappoint you. Believe me. I will not disappoint you. (Applause.)I campaigned on the promise that I will do everything in my power to bring those jobs back into America. We wanted to make much easier -- it has to be much easier to manufacture in our country and much harder to leave. I don't want companies leaving our country, making their product, selling it back, no tax, no nothing, firing everybody in our country. We're not letting that happen anymore, folks. Believe me. There will be a very substantial penalty to be paid when they fire their people and move to another country, make the product, and think that they're going to sell it back over what will soon be a very, very strong border. Going to be a lot different. Its going to be a lot different. (Applause.)Already American industry will come roaring back. And believe me if we -- not me, Im a messenger -- if we didn't have this victory, we wouldnt be even talking about it. To achieve that goal, were going to massively reduce job-crushing regulations -- already started; you've seen that -- that send our jobs to those other countries. We are going to lower taxes on American business so its cheaper and easier to produce product and beautiful things like airplanes right here in America. (Applause.)We are going to enforce -- very strongly enforce our trade rules and stop foreign cheating. Tremendous cheating. Tremendous cheating. We want products made by our workers, in our factories, stamped with those four magnificent words: Made in the USA. (Applause.)AUDIENCE: U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!THE PRESIDENT: Since November, jobs have already begun to surge. Were seeing companies open up factories in America. Were seeing them keep jobs at home. Ford, General Motors, Fiat-Chrysler -- just to name a very, very few. So many more already. They are keeping and bringing thousands of jobs back in country because the business climate, they know, has already changed.In Arizona, Intel announced it will open a new plant that will create 10,000 American jobs. They are spending billions of dollars. (Applause.) We will see more and more of that across the country as we continue to work on reducing regulations, cutting taxes -- including for the middle class, including for everyone, and including for business -- and creating a level playing field for our workers. When there is a level playing field, and Ive been saying this for a long time, American workers will always, always, always win. But we dont have a level playing field. Very shortly, you will have a level playing field again. (Applause.) Because when American workers win, America as a country wins -- big league wins.Thats my message here today. America is going to start winning again -- winning like never, ever before. We are not going to let our country be taken advantage of anymore in any way, shape or form. We love America, and we are going to protect America. We love our workers, and we are going to protect our workers. We are going to fight for our jobs, we are going to fight for our families and we are going to fight to get more jobs and better-paying jobs for the loyal citizens of our country. Believe me. (Applause.) Youve heard me say it before, and I will say it again: From now on, its going to be America first. (Applause.) Working together as a unit, there is nothing we cannot accomplish -- no task too large, no dream too great, no goal beyond our reach. Just like you built this incredible airplane behind me -- both of them, when you think about it -- we are going to rebuild this country and ensure that every forgotten community has the bright future it deserves. And by the way, those communities are forgotten no longer. The election took care of that. (Applause.) And we will pass on to our children the freedom and prosperity that is their American birthright. Our children will inherit from us a nation that is strong, that is proud and that is totally free. And each of you will be part of creating that new American future.I want to thank you, South Carolina. I want to thank the great people of South Carolina. God bless you, may God bless the United States of America, and God bless Boeing. (Applause.) Thank you, everybody. Thank you.END1:47 P.M.

182,2017-02-17,"Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders En Route West Palm Beach, Florida","Aboard Air Force OneEn Route West Palm Beach, Florida3:16 P.M. ESTMS. SANDERS: I'll read a little bit, give you guys a quick update. Clearly, I'm not Sean, but hopefully you guys will treat me just as nicely as you do him every week. First, I'd like to say the President was pleased to see that the EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, was confirmed by the Senate today. Administrator Pruitt will be essential in the President's plan to restore the EPA's essential mission of keeping our air and water clean and safe. In this administration, the EPA will no longer spend unnecessary taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control, anti-energy agenda. The President is glad to finally have him officially onboard. As you know, we just came from Boeing, where the President talked jobs with company executives and celebrated the rollout of the amazing 787-10 Dreamliner. That airplane is an incredible example of what American ingenuity and initiative can create. President Trump is committed to unleashing U.S. businesses so that we can create, imagine, inventive -- and building in this country again.Under the President's ambitious jobs plan, American industry will come roaring back. He's already started ending job-killing regulations and will be working to lower taxes on American businesses, and the results are already on their way. From Intel's incredible announcement last week to automakers keeping and bringing back thousands of jobs, businesses across the country are responding to the President's pro-growth plans.The trip to Boeing is the perfect cap on a week of tremendous progress on the President's economic agenda. And just yesterday, he signed House Joint Resolution 38, nullifying the job-killing stream-protection rule, which went into effect on the very last day of the Obama administration. This rule was just the left again imposing an anti-American energy agenda on the people without considering the significant cost. It took power away from state and local governments in order to grow the federal bureaucracy, ignoring the extremely negative impact it would have on hardworking Americans and their families, and the support by putting upward pressure on energy costs. President Trump is committed to ending the previous administration's war on coal, which is really a war on our coal miners. An October, 2015 economic analysis by the National Mining Association found that this rule jeopardizes as many as 280,000 jobs. Rolling back this rule is a significant step towards fulfilling the President's promise to restore America's coal-mining industry and the hundreds of thousands of jobs it supports. The President is bringing back jobs at both the plant and mine level, and the spirit of optimism rising across this country is only going to grow as the President signs more and more bills just like this one. Just look at the stock market, which hit record numbers this week, due to a surge in optimism in the business world and spurred by anticipation of the President's impending pro-growth agenda. These sentiments were echoed during the President's meeting on Wednesday with a group of CEOs from some of America's largest retailers. The retail sector supports roughly 42 million jobs, according to the National Retail Federal, more than any other sector of the economy. It's also saddled with some of the most burdensome tax and regulations of any industry. President Trump's pro-growth tax and regulatory reform plans will simplify our tax code and lower rates for hardworking Americans and their companies.Retail leaders thank the President for hosting them at the White House and noted that they were optimistic about the future, because no previous President had ever been so willing to hear from them directly on the issues that impact their business and customers. The President pledged to take appropriate action in the executive branch to address their concerns and to work closely with congressional leaders to pass legislation that will help create a dynamic, booming economy that works for all Americans.Tomorrow, the President will be back in front of the people at a rally at the Orlando Melbourne International Airport.Q  Where is it -- the international airport?MS. SANDERS: President Trump, just as he did so effectively throughout the campaign, is going to continue taking his message directly to the American people. I know hes looking forward to being back in Florida, a state that holds a special place in his heart, where the winter White House is, as well as a place that was so instrumental in his historic electoral victory in November. And with that, Ill take a few of your questions.Q  Sarah, can you talk about the expectations this weekend, in terms of who hes going to meet with to fulfill the role of the national security advisor?MS. SANDERS: We dont have any announcements at this time, but I know that obviously thats something the President takes very seriously, and wants to make sure hes got the right person in the job.Q  Who is he considering?MS. SANDERS: Again, we dont have any announcements or specific details to release at this time.Q  Can you give us a sense of his timetable? We know he had hoped to try to fill this position by today. Thats obvious its not going to happen, but do -- is the expectation within the next two days?MS. SANDERS: I don't know if we have a specific timetable, but if we do, Ill get back to you on it.Q  Are you thinking about redefining the job or changing the job description to make it more appealing, or to make sure that people that its offered to will take it?MS. SANDERS: Not to my knowledge, but, again, I can check on that.Q  While the President was at Boeing, did he express his commitment to funding the Ex-Im Bank?MS. SANDERS: I dont know if that was specifically addressed. Are you talking about in the private meeting?Q  Yeah.MS. SANDERS: Yeah, Im not sure if that was specifically addressed. I wasnt in the room for the private meeting.Q  Generally, does he support funding the Ex-Im Bank?MS. SANDERS: You know, I think thats a question that Ill let him answer down the line.Q  Sarah, the President yesterday said that he was going to be reintroducing the executive order -- a different version of the executive order on immigration and refugees. What is the White House doing differently this time around to ensure that the new order could withstand any legal challenge?MS. SANDERS: The President was pretty specific yesterday when he talked about it in terms of that it would match and address the concerns that were part of the legal complications it ran into previously.Q  Are different people involved? Is there a different sign-off process -- anything like that?MS. SANDERS: No, I mean, again, all of the people that needed to know the last time, that would be part of this process, would be involved in this process again.Q  Has the President seen a complete order at this point?MS. SANDERS:  I don't know if an order is finalized, but I know theyre working on it and expect to have that at the first part of next week.Q  Has he looked at it in progress, or will he wait until its finalized in its proposed form to take a look at it?MS. SANDERS: I know the President has been involved in the process, but I don't know if he has seen the most up-to-date version.Q  Sarah, can you say if the administration has ever considered having the National Guard help round up undocumented immigrants?MS. SANDERS: The President and the White House have never had that as part of any plan to use the National Guard in any capacity for that.Q  Why did Kelly draft this memo?MS. SANDERS: Im sorry?Q  Why did Kelly draft this memo if that was never considered?MS. SANDERS: Secretary Kelly? Q  Yeah.MS. SANDERS: Secretary Kelly did not draft that memo.Q  Were now on day 28 --Q  Who drafted it then? Wait, who drafted it?MS. SANDERS: Im not aware of the specific person, but I know that it wasnt Secretary Kelly, or at his direction.Q  Were now -- you know, the President was inaugurated four weeks ago today. Why does he feel the need tomorrow to go back onto the stump? And what should we expect to hear from him tomorrow?MS. SANDERS: I think its real simple the reason he wants to go back. I think, in large part, its because his message, when filtered through -- unfortunately, people standing in this circle dont always do the best job delivering his message, and nobody does it better than he does. And so, he can do that very easily by taking the stage and talking directly to the people of America, addressing their concerns, and being able to properly express exactly what hes doing, what his administration has done over the last month, and what they plan to do in the coming weeks.Q  Is this a campaign rally for 2020? Or is it a campaign rally for another candidate? Or how do you portray it?MS. SANDERS: I think its most likely a campaign rally for America. I think its -- again, its the Presidents time to be able to speak directly to people across this country in an unfiltered way, and in a way that doesn't have any bias that's been expressed through the reporting that usually happens.Q  But its being funded by a political organization, not the White House, is that right?MS. SANDERS: Correct.Q  Can you explain the funding?Q  Who is paying for the plane tomorrow going to and from the rally? How that's being done?MS. SANDERS: Specifically on the plane Ill have to double-check. I know the rally itself and I guess staging and everything to do with the rally is covered by the campaign. But Im not sure about the plane specifically. So Id have to --Q  So just to clarify, when you say the campaign, this is the campaign for what?MS. SANDERS: Well, President Trump still has a campaign in existence that can help pay for things that arent specific to the White House. Q  -- the Donald J. Trump for President, correct? MS. SANDERS: Yes, that's still fully operational.Q  So that's a 2020 committee, not a 2016 committee? Because that committee is now defunct.MS. SANDERS: Im not sure if its officially been transferred over from a 2016 to a 2020 focus. But we can check on that and let you know.Q  With increasing enforcement, that we've see in this administration, if you are not looking into having 100,000 National Guard, Im curious if you think you have to change the immigration infrastructure at all. Add more judges or -- you've already said you want to add more agents, but with increased enforcement, are you happy with what you have nationally and infrastructure-wise?MS. SANDERS: That's probably a question that those departments -- ICE might be better able to answer whether or not they need additional support. But right now we're just glad that they have the opportunity to actually go out and do their job, something they havent probably been allowed to do over the past eight years.Q  The President saying that he loves the DACA kids, and a couple have already been swept up in this increased enforcement, will there be anything in terms of -- besides that the President has talked about keeping DACA going or not, that's still up for debate -- will you do anything for the DACA kids who are not swept up in increased enforcement?MS. SANDERS: Look, I think the President addressed that yesterday. He wants to make sure that that's done correctly. Obviously, theres a compassion piece in that. And hes looking at those options and seeing what the best path is on that.Q  Sarah, just to be clear, you don't know who authored the executive order?MS. SANDERS: I don't specifically know who put pen to paper, but I know that it was not Secretary Kelly and it wasnt at his direction.Q  Did it happen during the transition?MS. SANDERS: Im not aware on the exact timeline of when it happened. But what I do know is that this White House and this President is not and has had no plans in any capacity to use the National Guard to round up people.Thanks, guys.END3:27 P.M.

186,2017-02-20,Remarks by the Vice President and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg at a JPA,"NATO HeadquartersBrussels, Belgium4:13 P.M. CETSECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: (In progress) took office, and just a few days after your great speech in Munich where you so clearly declared the strong commitment and the unwavering support of the United States to the transatlantic bond. And we welcome that because we see the strong commitment of the United States to the transatlantic bond, not only in words but also in deeds. These days the United States is deploying new forces -- additional forces -- to Europe, which is of great importance for the security of Europe and which demonstrates the strong transatlantic commitment of the United States. And we are very grateful for this commitment. You also stressed that just as the U.S. stood with Europe, Europe stood tall with the United States. And we have to remember that the only time that the alliance has involved our collective defense clause, Article 5, was after an attack on the United States. And this was more than just a gesture. Several hundred thousands of Canadian and European troops have served in Afghanistan, and more than a thousand have paid the ultimate price.The bond between the United States and NATO -- between the United States and Europe embodied in the NATO alliance is very important today because we live in times of turmoil and instability, and then we need a strong alliance more than ever. And we are stronger when we stand together. During our meeting, we discussed our progress in the fight against terrorism. NATO continues to train security forces in Afghanistan. We have started to train security forces and officers in Iraq. And we support the U.S.-led coalition against ISIL  with AWACS surveillance planes.But we agree that the alliance can and should do more in the fight against terrorism. We also agree on the importance of higher defense spending and fairer burden sharing in NATO. This is has been my top priority since I took office. Europeans cannot ask the United States to commit to Europes defense if they are not willing to commit more themselves. And they are committing more. In 2016, after many years of cuts, we turned a corner. Defense spending increased across Europe and Canada by 3.8 percent in real terms, or U.S. $10 billion. But we still have a long way to go, so all allies must speed up their efforts to spend 2 percent of GDP on defense.This will be an important point when allied leaders meet here in Brussels in May. So, Mr. Vice President, thank you for our excellent discussion. We agree that NATO is the most successful alliance in history because NATO has been able to adapt and change when the world is changing. And we agree that we must continue to change to keep our people safe. U.S. leadership remains indispensable. So I really look forward to working with you and to welcoming President Trump in Brussels in May.So please, you have the floor.THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mr. Secretary General.It is a privilege to meet with you today to bring greetings on behalf of President Donald Trump and also to have the opportunity for a thorough and substantive discussion of the issues facing NATO and our historic alliance.It has been a busy weekend for me. As I prepare to head back to the United States, Im grateful. Im grateful to have had the opportunity to speak on Saturday about our shared security issues at the Munich Security Conference. And I appreciate your encouraging words about the message of the United States at that conference.And I also was pleased to be able to hold a series of productive bilateral meetings with leaders from all across the world. It was also deeply moving for me and my family to return to Dachau, the very first concentration camp, and to be accompanied by a survivor by the name of Abba Naor. I had first visited that camp in 1977. I wanted my daughter to see it. And we went there and walked through that historic memorial. Abba told me that he arrived at Dachau as a 17-year-old boy. He told me of the nightmarish existence that he experienced there. But then he spoke words that resonate with our alliance. He said: Then the Americans came.Those words touched my heart, and they speak volumes about the history and importance of the North Atlantic alliance and of NATO, more of which Ill address momentarily.But I thank you again for your hospitality in this historic place at this important time.I was also grateful today to meet with the leadership of the European Union. And on behalf of President Trump, I express the commitment of the United States to continued cooperation and partnership with the EU.While we have our differences on some issues, I reiterated this point in all of my meetings with the EU leadership and appreciated the cordial and substantive discussions that we had.But on Saturday, as the Secretary General mentioned, at the Munich Security Conference, I brought a message from President Trump -- the message is the same one I bring to you today.It is my privilege here at the NATO Headquarters to express the strong support of President Trump and the United States of America for NATO and our transatlantic alliance.The United States has been a proud and faithful member of NATO since its founding in 1949. This alliance plays a crucial role in promoting peace and prosperity in the North Atlantic and, frankly, in the entire world.The United States commitment to NATO is clear. As we speak, President Trump and our administration are developing plans to ensure that the strongest military in the world in the United States becomes stronger still.Let me assure you, Mr. Secretary, that in the United States, we're about the process of strengthening our military and restoring the arsenal of democracy. Working with members of Congress, we intend to increase military funding to make it possible for us to provide for the common defense for the people of the United States, but also meet the obligations that we have with our treaty allies, including in this historic treaty.America -- therefore I can say with confidence: America will do our part. But Europes defense requires Europes commitment as much as ours.At the Wales Summit in 2014, all 28 members of the NATO alliance declared their intention to move towards a minimum security investment of 2 percent of their gross domestic product on defense within a decade.As a candidate for office, President Trump actually called attention repeatedly to the fact that for too long, for too many, this burden has not been shared fairly among our NATO allies. And that must come to an end.At this moment, the United States and only four other NATO members meet this basic standard. And while we commend the few nations that are on track and have met the obligation, the truth is that many others, including some of our largest allies, still lack a clear and credible path to meet this minimum goal.So let me say again what I said this last weekend in Munich, the President of the United States and the American people expect our allies to keep their word and to do more in our common defense. And the President expects real progress by the end of 2017.As Secretary of Defense James Mattis said here in Belgium just a few short days ago, if youre a nation that meets the 2 percent target, we need your help encouraging other nations to do likewise. If you have a plan to get there, as he said, our alliance needs you to accelerate it. And if you dont yet have a plan, these are my words not his: Get one. It is time for actions, not words.And let me thank specifically the Secretary General for your outspoken leadership on this issue. As you and I discussed privately and you've discussed with the President, the world needs NATOs strength and leadership now more than ever before. And we are grateful, Mr. Secretary General, that you join us in calling for immediate and steady progress on all of our NATO allies commitment to our common defense.The truth is the rise of adversaries new and old demands a strong response from this alliance. In the east, NATO has embarked on improvement in its deterrent posture by stationing four combat-ready multinational battalions in Poland and the Baltic States.And as I assured the Secretary General in our meeting today, in the wake of Russian efforts to redraw international borders by force, the United States will continue its leadership role in the Enhanced Forward Presence Initiative and other critical joint actions.With regard to Ukraine, as I said before, our alliance will continue to hold Russia accountable and demand that they honor the Minsk Agreements, beginning with de-escalating violence in eastern Ukraine.For the sake of peace and for the sake of innocent human lives, we urge both sides to abide by the ceasefire that began today. And we pray for peace in Ukraine.Be assured, the United States, as well, will continue to hold Russia accountable, even as we search for new common ground, which President Trump firmly believes can be found.As I said in Munich, though, NATOs continued leadership is also necessary in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism; this, another item that as a candidate for office, President Trump first raised.As a candidate a year ago, he called on NATO to evolve by expanding counterterrorism operations. And we're encouraged to see under your leadership NATO is in the process of doing just that. Its hard to speak of these issues in the abstract as I stand here in Brussels, just now almost a year ago that three horrific suicide bombings occurred, 33 innocent victims, including four Americans, hundreds more injured. I just want to assure the people of Brussels and all the people of Europe that your pain is our pain, your loss our loss. And its precisely why the President believes its essential that NATO continue on this new path of evolving and expanding its mission to be more effective in counterterrorism.We will work tirelessly with our NATO allies to ensure security in our countries and yours. But adapting to these new and ever-shifting challenges must remain a central focus of our collaboration and cooperation. Our alliance needs to intensify efforts to cut off terrorist funding and increase cyber capabilities. We must be -- as I said before, we must be as dominant in the digital world as we are in the physical world. And the United States is committed to continuing to work with our NATO allies to achieve that objective for the security of all the nations in our alliance.By building on tactics from the last century with these new century opportunities and challenges, NATO will be better prepared to confront and overcome the new adversaries of the 21st century.Under President Trumps leadership, the United States, I can assure you, is fully committed to NATOs noble mission. We are grateful for your leadership, Mr. Secretary General. And I know the President looks forward to working closely with you to advance our shared objectives. A strong NATO means a safer world. And the United States of America looks forward to continuing to work with our partners in NATO to achieve just that.So, Mr. Secretary, thank you very much for your hospitality and for your leadership.Q  Vice President, you've given your assurances today here in Brussels to European leaders that the U.S. is committed to working with Europe. President Trump has said very different things. Hes said that the EU is a vehicle for Germany, that the U.K. was smart to get out, and he expected other countries to follow. Who should European leaders listen to -- you or President Trump? Can they be certain that what you say, the assurances you give, wont be contradicted in a tweet or a statement at a press conference tomorrow? And, Secretary General, who do you listen to? And are you concerned about differences in what you hear?VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, thank you for the question. Let me say its my great privilege to serve as Vice President for the 45th President of the United States. And the President directed me to go to Munich and to come here to Brussels with a very specific message: To go to Munich to the Munich Security Conference and make it very clear, as I do so again today here at NATOs Headquarters, that the United States is expressing strong support for NATO, even as we challenge NATO and challenge our allies to evolve to the new and widening challenges and further meet their responsibilities in this ever-changing, ever-complicated world of threats.But with regard to the EU, the President also directed me to come here to Brussels. And I had the great privilege of meeting with leaders of the Europe Union throughout the morning, and to express the desire of the United States to continue cooperation and partnership with the European Union.We respect the determination of the people of Great Britain, as manifested in Brexit. And we respect the judgement of the peoples of Europe in the European Union. And as I said today through many leaders, we look forward to working across the Channel with all parties in the years ahead on behalf of peace and prosperity.SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: I have heard exactly the same firm message from the President of the United States in two phone calls; from the Vice President in meetings today and in Munich; and from Secretary Mattis -- Tillerson, and Kelly. They all conveyed the same message that the United States is firmly committed to the transatlantic partnership and have an unwavering support for the NATO alliance.And I welcome that very much -- both the very clear statements from all leaders in the new administration, but also the fact that this is not only something we see in words, but we also see it in deeds. For the first time in many years, we see an increase of U.S. military presence in Europe. And we are deploying new battle groups. The U.S. is deploying a new brigade. And we see on the ground more U.S. presence in Europe. So this is a commitment in words, but also in deeds.When it comes to the European Union, I would like to underline the importance of the enhanced cooperation between NATO and the European Union. We have actually been able to bring that to a new level, implementing many different issues -- or measures. And we signed the joint declaration between President Tusk, President Juncker, and me in Warsaw and are now following up on implementing that. We are working closer on hybrid, on cyber, on addressing how to build the capacity in our neighborhood, and how to stabilize our neighborhood, our areas where we work together with the European Union. And I think, actually, the NATO-EU cooperation is even more important now because we live in times with turmoil and unpredictability, and then we need a strong cooperation between NATO and the European Union, and I welcome the very strong U.S. support for that approach.Q  Thank you. Mr. Vice President, I wanted to ask you about the dismissal of General Flynn recently. Did you feel like you were misled by members of the Trump administration? Or were you frustrated that you were left out of the loop on this situation? And what assurances have you received from President Trump that something like this will not happen again? And for Mr. Secretary General, both you and the Trump administration have talked about the need for additional funding for defense. What are the consequences for inaction by NATO members? Is there any scenario in which the Article V commitments might be considered conditional if NATO members do not fulfill their defense spending obligations?VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you, Ken. Let me say, I am very grateful for the close working relationship I have with the President of the United States. I would tell you that I was disappointed to learn that the facts that had been conveyed to me by General Flynn were inaccurate. But we honor General Flynn's long service to the United States of America, and I fully support the President's decision to ask for his resignation. It was the proper decision. It was handled properly and in a timely way. And I have great confidence in the national security team of this administration going forward. The combination of Secretary Mattis, of Director Pompeo at the CIA, of Secretary Kelly at Homeland Secretary I think gives the American people great confidence that the team in this administration is providing the leadership and the direction to those agencies and also to the President of the United States to advance the security of our people.GENERAL SECRETARY STOLTENBERG: Our collective defense clause, our collective defense commitment is unconditional. It's absolute, and it's the core of the NATO alliance. And I welcome the very strong commitment of the United States to this transatlantic bond and to this collective defense clause.At the same time, I fully support what has been underlined by President Trump and by Vice President Pence today, the importance of burden-sharing. And I think we have to remember that this is not only something that the U.S. is asking for, it's actually something that 28 Allies agreed. The leaders from 28 NATO-allied countries sat around the same table in 2014 and agreed to stop the cuts, to gradually increase defense spending, and then to meet the 2 percent target within a decade. And the good news is that we are moving in the right direction. After many years of decline, after many years of defense cuts across Europe and Canada, we saw that in 2015 we stopped the cuts, the first year after we made the pledge. And then, in 2016, we had a significant increase of 3.8 percent in real terms, or $10 billion.There is a long way to go, and much remains to be done, but at least we have turned a corner and we have started to move in the right direction. I am encouraged by that, and I expect all allies to make good on the promise that they made in 2014 to increase defense spending and to make sure to have a fairer burden-sharing.Q  A question to the Vice President and the Secretary General. The German Foreign Minister has called the 2 percent goal too ambitious, and said that more spending would not necessarily lead to more security. Are you disappointed by that? And what would be the consequence if a country like Germany would not hold up to the 2 percent goal?And a question to the Vice President, if I may. President Trump has repeatedly talked about his war with the press. Since NATO is an alliance of values, can you assure the allies that the freedom of press is not under threat in the United States? Thank you.GENERAL SECRETARY STOLTENBERG: All allies have committed to the defense investment pledge, meaning to stop the cuts and to start to increase. And that also includes Germany, and it has also been clearly expressed from Germany that they are committed to the defense investment pledge we made together in 2014.The good thing is that Germany has started to increase defense spending. In 2017, there will be a significant increase in German defense spending, with around or by -- around 8 percent. So, of course, Germany, as many other allies, have a long way to go. And some allies will meet the 2 percent target within a year or two. Romania declared last week that they will meet the 2 percent target this year. Lithuania and Latvia will soon be able to meet the 2 percent target also within a year or two. So we are really making progress. Germany has started to increase defense spending. And again, I expect all allies to keep the pledge they made together as leaders in 2014.  VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Let me say again: The President and I, our administration, are very grateful for the Secretary General's focus on burden-sharing and for our NATO allies, whether it be Germany or other countries, to meet the commitment that treaty allies made to one another.I think it's a demonstration of President Trump's leadership that before taking office he was speaking about the fact that the United States provides more than 70 percent of the cost of NATO today, and we are committed to continue to do our part, but that the time has come for our NATO allies to step forward. And the Secretary General's strong message on this is in all of our collective interest.I will tell you that I had very productive discussions with Chancellor Merkel. We spoke about just this issue. And we look forward to a continued dialogue. Our hope is that we will have a date very soon where Chancellor Merkel will come to the White House. I expect the President will talk with her about it, as well. But this is simply about all of us doing what we all said we would do -- to provide for our common defense. And in the ever-changing threat environment in which we live, that's more important now than ever.With regard to your second question, rest assured that both the President and I strongly support a free and independent press. But you can anticipate that the President and all of us will continue to call out the media when they play fast and loose with the facts. And the truth is that we have in President Trump someone who has a unique ability to speak directly to the American people. And when the media gets it wrong, I promise you President Trump will take his case straight to the American people to set the record straight.Q  Mr. Vice President, you said the U.S. commitment to the EU was steadfast and enduring. Is the administration opposed to further disintegration of the EU, further countries exiting? And on NATO, what is the or else? If there isnt more defense spending this year, would you recommend cutting the European Reassurance Initiative? Would you cut back on exercises? What's the or else?VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Well, I think your second question is a very fair one. What is the or else? I think when Secretary Mattis was here, he spoke very plainly here at NATO's headquarters about the frustration of the American people, that as our country continues to make investments in Europe's security, we see European countries falling behind. The President really put this issue front and center, before the American people in his campaign for President. And, frankly, it struck a very resonant chord. And so I dont know what the answer is to or else, but I know that the patience of the American people will not endure forever; that the commitment that we have made to one another, that the American people are keeping with the people of Europe and NATO, is a commitment that the President of the United States and the American people expect our allies in Europe to keep, as well. But failing that, questions about the future we'll just leave in the future as hypotheticals.But I have to tell you, with the Secretary General's strong leadership, having made the issue of burden-sharing his top priority, having a partnership with so many countries across NATO who, in my meetings over this weekend, have expressed a desire to step forward and keep their word, I'm very encouraged about the progress. What you see happening here is in a very real sense the result of American leadership. In President Trump we have a President who is stepping forward, he's expressing American leadership not just on the issue of funding, but also on his call last year that NATO should evolve to widen its tactics to include counterterrorism as a major focus. And NATO has begun to do that. The United States looks forward to supporting that.With regard to the European Union, my message very simply was that the United States is committed to continuing our partnership with the European Union. And I wanted to make that very clear. We understand the relationship between our economies. We understand the deep heritage of member states in the European Union with people in the United States of America. Looking for ways that we could reassure this weekend leaders of the European Union of our commitment to ongoing cooperation and that maintaining that partnership in the years ahead is hopefully a resonant message that came through, and it's my great privilege to be here to deliver it.SECRETARY GENERAL STOLTENBERG: Let me just add that the focus of the alliance is on how can we make sure that we succeed in delivering on what we agreed about fairer burden-sharing and increased defense spending. And, therefore, I will not speculate so much about or else, what will happen if we dont succeed. But we heard a very firm and clear message from the United States. We heard it from the President, we heard it from the Vice President, and from Secretary Mattis at the defense ministerial meeting. So I think that just underlines the importance of making sure that we move, that we succeed in increasing defense spending across Europe and Canada. And the good thing is that we have started; 3.8 percent real increase in 2016 is a significant step, but is only one step in the right direction. We need much more.Let me also add that we need both to spend more, but we also need to spend better. So the focus of the alliance, the focus of the defense ministers, but also in our cooperation with the European Union, is how can we increase efficiency, how can we develop cooperation, how can we make sure that we address the fragmentation of especially European defense industry so we can reduce costs and get more out of the money we invest in our defense. But there is no way we can choose between either spend more or better. We need to spend both more and better. So what we committed in 2014 was not either to spend more or to spend better, but it was to spend 2 percent of GDP in a better way, and we are addressing both things, and we are moving forward on both tracks.END4:44 P.M.

187,2017-02-20,Remarks by the Vice President and European Council President Tusk,"The European Union CouncilBrussels, BelgiumPRESIDENT TUSK: Mr. Vice President, dear friends, let me first of all thank you for this meeting. We all truly needed it.Too much has happened over the past month and in your country and you; too many new and sometimes surprising opinions have been voiced over -- in this time about our relations and our common security for us to pretend that everything is as it used to be.And thank you for being so open and frank with me, Mr. Vice President. Today I heard words which are promising for the future, words which explain a lot about the approach of the new administration in Washington.I repaid our guest by offering honesty in my assessment of the situation. I shared our concerns and hopes. Given that I am an incurably pro-American European who is fanatically devoted to transatlantic cooperation, I could afford to be outspoken even more.I asked the Vice President directly if he shared my opinions on three key matters: international order, security, and the attitude of the new American administration towards the European Union.Firstly, I expressed my belief that maintaining order based on the rules of international law where brute force and egoism do not determine everything lies in the interest of the West; and that maintaining that order can only be enforced through a common, mutually supportive and decisive policy of the whole of the Western community. And for millions of people around the world, the predictability and stability of our approach provides the guarantee of, at the very least, hope that chaos, violence, and arrogance will not triumph in the global dimension.Referring to some statements made in Munich just two days ago, I would like to say clearly that the reports of the death of the West have been greatly exaggerated. Whoever wants to demolish that order, anticipating a post-West order must know that in its defense we remain determined.Secondly, our security is based on NATO and the closest possible transatlantic cooperation. We must work together to modernize the forms of this cooperation. Some of them should, indeed, be improved. But we should also, I believe, agree on one thing: The idea of NATO is not obsolete, just like the values, which lay at its foundation are not obsolete. Let us discuss everything, starting with financial commitment -- but only to strengthen our solidarity, never to weaken it. Thirdly, we are counting, as always, on the past; on the United States whole-hearted and unequivocal -- let me repeat unequivocal -- support for the idea of a united Europe. The world would be a decidedly worst place if Europe were not united.Americans know best what great value it is to be united, and that becoming divided is the prelude to a fall. It is in the interest of us all to prevent the disintegration of the West.And as for our continent, in this respect, we will not invent anything better than the European Union. In reply to these three methods, I heard today from Vice President Pence three times, yes. After such a positive declaration, both Europeans and Americans must simply practice what they preach.On Saturday in Munich, you mentioned that during your trip across Europe in 1977 with your older brother, you found yourselves at some point in West Berlin, marveling at what you saw; then crossing through Checkpoint Charlie only to see the shadow of repression hanging over people. If you know, I had been living under this shadow for over 30 years. What I vividly remember from my own past is how after martial law was imposed in Poland on December 13, 1981, President Ronald Reagan urged all Americans to light a solidarity candle on Christmas Eve, as he did himself.It is not difficult to imagine how this moving message of American solidarity with the oppressed Polish nation against, as Reagan said, the forces of tyranny and those who incite them from without, helped bring back hope and the determination not to give in.In your speech, you also highlighted the historic role of some American and European leaders including Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa. I was lucky to cooperate closely with the two of them in difficult times. Similarly to us, they all believed in the purpose of cooperation and solidarity between Europe and the U.S. We cannot let their efforts go to waste. After todays talks, it will be easier for me to believe that we will fulfill this task. Thank you.VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you, President Tusk. Thank you for your warm hospitality today.And thank you for those eloquent words and your personal courage and leadership. Its an honor to meet you and on behalf of the President of the United States to bring greetings. And I may make a note never to follow you at a podium again. (Laughter.) So thank you again for your eloquence.Last night I was honored to have dinner with the Prime Minister of Belgium. This morning I met with the European Unions High Representative Mogherini. And this morning, a very constructive and productive conversation with President Tusk, and its an honor to be here.This afternoon, I will meet with President Juncker of the European Commission before taking meetings at NATO at returning to Washington, D.C.Saturday, as President Tusk said, I was pleased to address the Munich Security Council to speak about the importance of the strategic alliance the United States entered upon so many years ago in the North American Treaty Organization.But the President did ask me to come here to Brussels, to the home of the European Union, and deliver an additional message. And so today it is my privilege on behalf of President Trump to express the strong commitment of the United States to continued cooperation and partnership with the European Union. Whatever our differences, our two continents share the same heritage, the same values, and above all, the same purpose: to promote peace and prosperity through freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. And to those objectives we will remain committed.This has been the European Unions goal since before its formal founding in 1993. What began as a modest Western European trade agreement in 1951 has grown into a commitment to the four freedoms: freedom of movement -- goods, capital, services, and people; a common currency; and a common approach to foreign and security policy.And what began 60 years ago with the Treaty of Rome among six Western European nations has grown to encompass north and south, east and west; and you welcomed new states after the end of the Cold War. With this union and in cooperation with the United States, history will attest that when the United States and Europe are peaceful and prosperous, we do advance the peace and prosperity of all the world. Our economies are the worlds largest -- accounting for half of the worlds economic output. Transatlantic commerce supports 14 million jobs on both continents and improves the lives and well-being of all of our citizens. And so today we reaffirm our commitment to free, fair, and flourishing economies that undergird our success, and to cooperation in achieving that.Maintaining and strengthening our economic vitality will require hard but necessary choices. Renewed growth means improved peace and prosperity for all. We must be strong, and we must be united, as well, in our efforts to confront threats to Europes security and stability. Its heartbreaking to reflect that now nearly a year ago, here in Brussels, in the heart of the European Union, three horrific suicide bombings and attacks took place, killing 33 innocent victims, including four Americans, injuring hundreds more.Let me say to this community, the European community, your losses at the hands of barbaric terrorists are felt equally in every household and every heart in America. And you have our condolences and our determination to continue to do all that we can in partnership with the European Union and with all of our allies in Europe to ensure that such attacks never happen again.We seek to take measures, and we call upon the European community to join with the United States in continuing to intensify our efforts to counter the threat of radical Islamic terrorism here on the continent.Now, this will require greater coordination and intelligence sharing among EU member states and between the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. And let me assure you, the United States is committed to continuing and expanding our collaboration on the collective security of all of our peoples. The safety and security of your union and our people depends on that increased collaboration in the global fight against terrorism. And the United States will remain a full partner with the EU and with all of our European allies to accomplish that.In addition to confronting terrorism together, clearly we must stand strong in defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations in Europe. In the wake of Russian efforts to redraw international borders by force, we will continue to support efforts in Poland and the Baltic States through NATOs Enhanced Forward Presence Initiative.And with regard to Ukraine, the United States will continue to hold Russia accountable and demand that Russia honor the Minsk Agreements, beginning by de-escalating the violence in eastern Ukraine. We urge both sides -- we urge both sides -- to abide by the cease-fire that was scheduled to begin today. And in the interest of peace and in the interest of innocent human lives, we hope and pray that this cease-fire takes hold.While the United States will continue to hold to hold Russia accountable, at President Trumps direction, we will also search in new ways for new common ground with Russia, which President Trump believes can be found.The United States commitment to the European Union is steadfast and enduring. President Tusk, President Trump and I look forward to working together with you and the European Union to deepen our political and economic partnership. We are separated by an ocean, but we are joined by a common heritage and by a common commitment to freedom, to democracy, and to the rule of law. And we're confident that that bond will endure and grow in the years ahead as we meet our future together.Thank you again for your hospitality, Mr. President. And thank you all.END",,,,,,

190,2017-02-21,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/21/2017, #13","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:42 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. It's been a little while. Hope you missed me. (Laughter.) Q  You missed us?MR. SPICER: Absolutely. Weve got a lot to talk about today, so lets get right to it.First off, I want to acknowledge the tragic plane crash that occurred in Australia that took the lives of five individuals, including four Americans. The Presidents thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims, and the U.S. embassy and consulate are ready to provide necessary and appropriate assistance.Moving on, the President was honored to announce that Lieutenant General McMaster will be his National Security Advisor. General McMaster served this nation in the United States Army for over three decades, including during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Desert Storm.The President met with many distinguished and qualified candidates for the position, and as he has said that he will continue to consider many of them for other positions within the administration. He is especially pleased that Lieutenant General Kellogg will stay on as the National Security Council Chief of Staff.The President is proud to welcome General McMaster to the team where he will have full authority to structure the office to his desires to best serve its ultimate mission, which is to protect the American interests at home and abroad.This morning, Secretary Kelly and the Department of Homeland Security released memos regarding the implementation of two of the Presidents executive orders that are designed to protect the homeland. These two memos provide explicit guidance to DHS staff on how to carry out two executive orders signed by the President on January 25th -- one dealing with interior enforcement and one dealing with border security. Perhaps most critically, the President is empowering DHS to carry out the immigration laws currently on the books. Of course, DHS gave a full briefing on these memos this morning, but just to briefly summarize a few of the facts: The memo regarding the executive order Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States outlines several practices and policies in order to strengthen the efficient and faithful execution of this countrys immigration laws. That includes hiring more ICE agents and officers, as well as additional mission support and legal staff necessary to support their activities. This memo also directs the establishment of the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement Office within ICE, fulfilling another major campaign promise of the President. This office will facilitate the engagement with victims and their families to ensure that their questions and concerns regarding immigration enforcement efforts are addressed.The memo regarding the executive order Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements outlines the steps that DHS will take to secure the nations southern border, prevent further illegal immigration, and to repatriate illegal immigrants swiftly, consistently, and humanely. This includes immediately identifying and allocating all sources of available funding for the planning, design, construction, and maintenance of a wall along our southern border and hiring of additional personnel, including 5,000 additional CBP border agents.Again, I would refer you to DHS for further comment on these specific memos. There are factsheets and Q&As on the DHS website that address many of the intricacies in areas within each of these executive orders that you might have questions on.Also, this weekend, the President had calls with the President of Panama and the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago. Readouts of those calls have both been provided.The Presidents team this weekend also had a very productive meeting on the Presidents plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, and ensure that it is replaced with a system that works for all Americans.Back to the Presidents schedule today, in honor of Black History Month, the President started his day by visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The museum opened last September and has quickly become one of Washingtons most-visited attractions.The President was joined by a group of individuals that included his daughter, Ivanka; Dr. Ben Carson and his wife; Senator Tim Scott;Alveda King, the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.; museum director Lonnie Bunch; Dr. David Skorton, who is the Secretary of the Smithsonian, as well as others.The President commented several times during his tour about how impressed he was with the museum. Some of the exhibits that he was particularly drawn to included the section on Harriet Tubman, which featured a shawl that was given to her by Queen Victoria in the late 1800s; the section of the museum that featured the courageous contribution of African Americans that have made to the United States military. And the President was particularly pleased by the Muhammad Ali exhibit with the quote, I shook up the world prominently displayed.The President also enjoyed viewing for the first time with Dr. and Mrs. Carson the exhibit dedicated to his extraordinary life. Similarly, Alveda King, who had never viewed the museums exhibit on her uncle, the President was honored that he was able to share this experience with the two of them specifically.The President further expressed his appreciation for the tour, and said he looks forward to returning again. His desire is to honor the immense contributions of courageous African American leaders throughout our history by building a more unified country, dedicated to liberty and justice.This afternoon, the President will have a routine, classified National Security Council briefing in the Situation Room, in addition to his Presidential Daily Briefing, which he received earlier this morning.Then, this evening the President will have dinner with Vice President Pence. Im sure that they will discuss the Vice President's recent trip to Europe. The Vice President was an incredible representative for our nation and the President during his time, where he reiterated our support for our European allies in unified pursuit of the noble ideals of freedom, democracy, and justice, and the rule of law and discussing how to do more to encourage all NATO allies to meet their financial obligations and commitments. During his speech before the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, the Vice President conveyed the administrations unwavering commitment to Europes peace and prosperity, especially remembering the tens of thousands of Americans who gave their lives to defend those ideals during both World War I and II. These shared sacrifices are the backbone of our alliance and our mission of security through strength.During his time in Munich, the Vice President also met with nine world leaders. The Vice President and these leaders discussed the issues most pressing to them, including the escalating violence in eastern Ukraine and the role of NATO in the fight against ISIS. The Vice President also met in Brussels with President of Tusk -- Vice President Tusk of the Council of the European Union and NATO Secretary -- the NATO Secretary General.As a candidate for office, President Trump actually called attention repeatedly to the fact that for too long, many of our NATO allies have not been sharing the financial burden. The President looks forward to working closely with NATO to advance our shared objectives. A strong NATO means a safer world. And the United States looks forward to working with our partners in NATO to achieve just that.Looking ahead to the Presidents upcoming schedule -- tomorrow, he will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson, fresh off his trip to Germany for the G20 Foreign Ministers Summit. They'll discuss the Presidents foreign policy agenda and the Secretarys upcoming trip to Mexico.Thursday morning, he'll have a listening session regarding job creation in the manufacturing sector with CEOs and business leaders from different industries.On Friday, he'll deliver remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference. And we are just one week out today from the Presidents Joint Address to Congress.The President will continue to work closely with his team to craft a speech that lays out his ambitious policy agenda that will benefit all Americans. Plans are currently in the works for pre- and post-address activities for the President and his staff. And we'll have more updates as the week goes on.Before I take your questions, I want to address the recent threats and acts of vandalism on Jewish community centers throughout the country. The President said this morning -- I just want to reiterate -- ""The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community centers are horrible and painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that we must do"" -- excuse me -- ""the work that must be done to root outhate and prejudice and evil.""With that, Ill take some of your questions. Jim Stinson.Q  Sean, thank you. I was curious if the President regrets or wants to clarify his characterization -- by the way, I have two questions -- of the media as an ""enemy of the American people.""MR. SPICER: I think the President has been very clear that certain outlets have gone out of their way to not represent his record accurately, and it is a concern to him.And I think some reporters -- he has deep respect for the First Amendment, for the role of the press -- Ive addressed this multiple times in the past. He has a healthy respect for the press. But I think that its a two-way street, as Ive also said before, and I think that the President understands that certain outlets have gone out of their way to not be completely accurate and fair in their coverage of whats going on.Q  Speaking of the media, Ive noticed two times in the last week that youve been directly contradicted by two members of the media, one of them Bill Maher of HBO, who said that in front of guests at Mar-a-Lago, the President was briefed on the classified North Korean situation.MR. SPICER: Say that again, Im sorry.Q  The President and the Prime Minister of Japan were briefed in front of guests --MR. SPICER: No, I didnt say that.Q  No, no, no, this is what was being said on HBO, that the President and the Prime Minister were briefed on classified information in front of guests at Mar-a-Lago. I just want to clarify, did that happen? Did they --MR. SPICER: No. No. I think I walked through this timeline before, Jim. And its amazing -- a photo gets put out, the President has got a piece of paper, and the immediate conclusion is hes got to be talking about classified information.The President was briefed on the situation in North Korea prior to the dinner, in a SCIF, thats at Mar-a-Lago. He went and had dinner. He discussed the logistics of the press conference, which Ive talked to you all before -- there was a question as to where to hold the press conference. They had a discussion about the logistics of it. And subsequent to that dinner, he was briefed again in a SCIF with updates on the situation in North Korea. Thats it, plain and simple. But to your first question, I think that its amazing that the immediate jump of conclusion to several outlets was, well, theres a piece of paper, it must be classified. I dont -- its amazing to see that and to see people jump to that conclusion that hes surrounded by his staff and members of the Japanese delegation, the conclusion is they must be doing something nefarious or wrong. In fact, he followed every procedure thats laid out.And I think in some cases, its disheartening to realize that those are the kind of immediate conclusions that somebody jumps to. So when you talk about coverage, we have a free press. We have the right for people to say and do what they believe. But at some point, it is incumbent upon people to try to get it right. And in that case, it wasnt even attempted. It was a jump to conclusion by many to say that there must be something else going on when, in fact, we were able to provide a very, very clear tick-tock as to what had happened in that.Jessica.Q  Sean, a question about the resignation of 10 people on the Asian American Council. That happened last week. And in the letter, they said in part, We can no longer serve a President whose policies aim to create outcomes that are diametrically opposite to our principles, goals and charge. First of all, whats the White Houses reaction? And do you plan to appoint your own members to this council?MR. SPICER: Those members of that council were political appointees of the Obama administration. Their terms were set to expire this year. So its not surprising in the sense that they were appointees of Barack Obama. They were going to have their terms expire.Q  But in terms of --But again, but -- I get it, but most political appointees from other agencies or whatever would automatically resign because of the term of these individuals, they would carry through until later in the year. But I dont think its surprising that people who were appointed by Barack Obama to fulfill his agenda suddenly understand that there is a new administration in town and didnt want to stay on board.But we will make sure that we appoint people to this task force. Its important. Its something thats provided guidance to multiple presidents in the past, and we will continue to do that.Shannon.Q  On the statement today about the anti-Semitic acts, what specifically is the President going to do to address that issue? And, along those lines, there were reports earlier on that he was considering changing the mandate of this countering violent extremism program to focus just on Islamic extremist groups. Is he still considering that, or would he also leave the scope of the program to also consider --MR. SPICER: Are you talking about the travel executive order?Q  No, no, no, this is the countering violent extremism program that --MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think were getting ahead of ourselves there. Theres nothing to announce on that front. And secondly, to the first part of your question, I think the President is going to do what hes talked about since election night. Its through deed and action, talk about how we can unify this country and speak out against hate, anti-Semitism, racism. And hes going to continue to do that.And I think that he will show you over the course of months and years, through what he does in terms of his policies and his speech, that he is going to be a President that brings people together, that unites them, and that speaks very, very forcefully against those who are seeking to do hate or to tear people down because of their religion or their gender or the color of their skin. I mean, those are all things that I think the President was clear on.John.Q  Two questions unrelated, if I could. The next big piece in the immigration profile here at the White House is going to be the new executive order. Is the President confident that this one will pass legal muster? And if he is, what gives him that confidence?MR. SPICER: Well, I think -- first, I want to be clear that we feel confident that were still going to prevail on the case -- the merits of the case. I think that as was seen in the case of Massachusetts, once it is fully adjudicated, we will prevail because the authority is granted to the President to do what he has to, to protect the country. So I feel very, very confident about where we're going to go.The second track that he's made very clear as well is that until that occurs, we're going to have a dual-track system. And then we're going to make sure that we implement a second executive order that is tailored to achieve the same goals but in accordance with what the court said. So we've been working very closely with the Department of State, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and the team here at the White House to make sure that the next step achieves the President's goal of protecting the country and does so in a way that recognizes the concerns that the court had until we prevail at a later time. So it's a dual-track thing.Q  Will this administration send American terror suspects picked up overseas to Guantanamo Bay for interrogation or prosecution?MR. SPICER: I am not going to discuss that right now. As the President has said very clearly before, we don't telegraph what we're going to do. I think he has made very clear, though, that he believes that Guantanamo Bay does serve a very, very healthy purpose in our national security in making sure that we don't bring terrorists to our seas. But I'm not going to get into what we may or may not do in the future.Q  Including American citizens?MR. SPICER: Again, I'm just not going to --Q  Sean, I want to give you a chance to respond to something because I think the President's remarks and your clarification about where he stands on anti-Semitism is clear. But after that statement was made by the President, The Anne Frank Center released a pretty strongly worded one, saying that these remarks, while well-received, are a Band-Aid on the cancer within the Trump administration, saying that there is, whether blessed or otherwise, a sense of xenophobia within this administration. What do you think about that?MR. SPICER: Look, the President has made clear since the day he was elected and, frankly, going back through the campaign, that he is someone who seeks to unite this country. He has brought a diverse group of folks into his administration, both in terms of actual positions and people that he has sought the advice of. And I think he has been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their hate -- excuse me, because of their religion, because of their gender, because of the color of their skin. And it is something that he is going to continue to fight and make very, very clear that he has no place in this administration.But I think that it's ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this, that it's never good enough. Today I think was an unbelievably forceful comment by the President as far as his denunciation of the actions that are currently targeted towards Jewish community centers, but I think that he's been very clear previous to this that he wants to be someone that brings this country together and not divide people, especially in those areas.So I saw that statement. I wish that they had praised the President for his leadership in this area. And I think that hopefully, as time continues to go by, they recognize his commitment to civil rights, to voting rights, to equality for all Americans.Q  Sean, on that, the southern part of --MR. SPICER: We started early with the two questions.Q  Sorry. Sean, Southern Poverty -- I think you'll want to respond to this.MR. SPICER: Okay.Q  Southern Poverty Law Center said that the number of anti-Muslim groups in the U.S. has tripled between 2015 and 2016, during the time of the campaign. Is this message within the administration -- anti-Semitism is not allowed, xenophobia is not allowed -- anti-Muslim sentiment within the administration, has the President been forceful about that particular issue?MR. SPICER: I think that the President, in terms of his desire to combat radical Islamic terrorism, he understands that people who want to express a peaceful position have every right in our Constitution. But if you come here or want to express views that seek to do our country or our people harm, he is going to fight it aggressively, whether it's domestic acts that are going on here or attempts through people abroad to come into this country. So there's a big difference between preventing attacks and making sure that we keep this country safe so that there is no loss of life in allowing people to express themselves in accordance with our First Amendment. Those are two very, very different, different, different things. Q  Sean, you talked about how the manufacturing -- I didn't know where you were going.MR. SPICER: I was (inaudible) in the back. (Laughter.) Q  I saw the manufacturing CEOs are coming on Thursday, so let me ask you something that's important to them, which is the border adjustment tax.  The President earlier this year called it ""too complicated."" Does he still feel that way? And whether he feels this is complicated or not, is there something within the administration one way or another about whether the President, the administration wants to see this in or out of the tax package?MR. SPICER: So theres several pieces to that that Ill try to unpack. That counts as, like, eight questions. Q  Does he feel its complicated, and whats your preference?MR. SPICER: So, first of all, on the meeting on Thursday, this is going to be a really historic opportunity for CEOs to come in and talk to members of the White House staff and others through various agencies about how we can create jobs, how regulations are stifling economic growth. And I think well have further details on that, but this is going to be a real interesting opportunity to really create a dialogue I think in a manner that hasnt been done before -- but Im not going to get ahead of myself on this -- where we can really discuss some of the inhibitors to job creation, job retraining, what do we need for American workers to get them ahead of the curve.With respect to specific policy positions, I think the President has been very clear that in the next couple weeks we expect to have a tax plan that gets out there. That is being worked on continuously. And so Im not going to get in front of that. While the CEOs are here, Im sure beyond some of these things, thats an opportunity for them to express what some of those policies are that are both helping them create jobs and grow the economy, and also inhibiting them. So lets let that conversation play out. Yes.Q  Okay, thank you, Sean. My name is Raquel (ph) from TV Global News (ph) Brazil. And I have a question. There are doubts in Brazil right now about whats going to happen to the relationship between the two countries with the new administration, especially related to immigration and also to trade deals. Does President Trump also plan to review policies -- bilateral policies with Brazil in trade deals? And also, my second question, how does the administration see the current turmoil -- economical and political turmoil in Brazil? And one more question, if I might. (Laughter.) President Trump spoke with some foreign leaders from South America, like Argentina, Colombia and Peru, but not -- it was the Vice President that spoke with President Temer from Brazil. Why is that?MR. SPICER: Well, obviously, we cherish our relationship with Brazil. I think theres a timing factor here and I think well look forward to speaking with the President soon. So I wouldnt read too much into that right now. Its just a matter of getting things on the schedule.Were going to review all the trade deals that are out there. The President has made very clear some of them have occurred well into a decade, two decades ago. I think the idea is to make sure that we are looking at all of the trade deals we have throughout the globe to make sure that they continue to benefit America and American workers.  And in many cases, we can update these deals. So its not any one particular country. I think that were going to look throughout the whole host of trade agreements, and then other trade-related agreements that we have with countries to make sure that they are the most up-to-date and they address the technological advances that have occurred, and look at the various services -- whether its financial services or manufacturing -- and that they reflect the current state of play.So this isnt any one country. I think the President made clear throughout the campaign and subsequent that he wants to review every trade deal to make sure that America and American workers are maintaining the best deal possible.Corbett (ph). Oh, Im sorry.Q  And on the turmoil, how does the administration see the turmoil in Brazil now?MR. SPICER: Im going to -- I think thats a question for the Department of State right now. Corbett, yeah.Q  Thanks, Sean. Two questions for you. One on the NSC meeting later this afternoon. Is that the first meeting of the National Security Council of the President with all the principals there?MR. SPICER: No, that is just a routine briefing. But because of the nature of it, its happening in the Situation Room.Q  But is that with staff, or is that with --MR. SPICER: Staff.Q  Okay, so its not with, like, the principals committee.MR. SPICER: No.Q  When do you anticipate the first formal meeting of the National Security Council?MR. SPICER: Well, I think General McMaster got here at noon today, so -- (laughter) -- we move fast, but I think that we need to give him a few days probably to get his team together.So the President was obviously very pleased with the selection. I think when you saw the bipartisan support that General McMaster received from the variety of the political spectrum -- people who have served Republicans and Democrats, academics, pundits, columnists -- you know that he made an outstanding choice. We want to get him in, show him around the office a little bit, and then get him going.But when we have a date to announce the next meeting, well let you know.Q  The joint address for next week, whats the Presidents goal for that address?MR. SPICER: I think that -- Ill have a further update as the week goes on, and well have briefings. The President is going to lay out I think two main things -- where weve come and where were going. I think that he is very pleased with the progress that he has made so far in the first month in office, and I think its an opportunity to remind members of Congress and the American people what he promised them on the campaign trail, what hes done already in a very significant way to achieve and fulfill those promises that he made, but also talk about the challenges that we have as a nation and where were going. And thats everything from our relationship with other countries in this world to some of the various domestic problems that we face, the challenges that we face in cities, health care, education.But the President wants to make sure that the American people have a very clear indication as to where hes taking this country and why hes going to enact the policies hes going to enact.John. George, Im sorry.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. Let me ask you a question about the Vice Presidents European trip. Im curious whether he received any commitments from our European allies to commit more in terms of their financial contribution to NATO.MR. SPICER: I think several of them -- I saw Chancellor Merkels comments previous to that, noting that they understand that the U.S. is asking for that commitment.Look, were one of the only countries -- theres a handful -- that are doing what NATO requires, which is 2 percent of GDP. Some of them are at 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, and some of them are below that. But weve got to ask them to do what they agreed to do. And I think weve had a very positive reaction from most of these NATO countries that understand that the financial agreement that they agreed to is something that they need to live up to. And I think the Vice President continued to receive assurances, much like the President has through his foreign leader calls, where people not only understand it but are willing to follow through on it.Q  So its an ongoing process, or --MR. SPICER: Of course its an ongoing -- I mean, I think we need to follow up to make sure that the commitments that theyre making on the phone or in person, in the case of the Vice President, are followed up.Dave.Q  Sean, thanks. The DHS memos today -- obviously these immigration enforcement efforts cost money, hiring more agents.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  Do you envision that the current budget is sufficient, or are you going to need to go to Congress for more money?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think right now ICE and DHS in particular, as well as CBP, are looking at what this is going to cost and how much and putting a request together, and then figuring out how much can be handled through reallocation of resources and how much we can save maybe in another area, but then also work with Congress.Q  One other subject, different matter. There was an election report out today that the President raised more small campaign donations in 2016 than either Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders combined. Did he have a reaction to that? Has he seen that?MR. SPICER: I dont know, and I would ask you to probably go through the RNC for that. Thats a political matter that we generally dont discuss.Yeah.Q  Sean, the National Center for Transgender Equality, citing reliable sources, says the Trump administration today will rescind Obama-era guidance requiring schools to allow transgender kids to use the restroom consistent with their gender identity. Will the Trump administration rescind that guidance?MR. SPICER: Right now thats an issue that the Department of Justice and the Department of Education are addressing. I would tell you that -- and I think that there will be further guidance coming from DOJ in particular with respect to not just the executive order, but also the case thats in front of the Supreme Court. The President has maintained for a long time that this is a states' rights issue and not one for the federal government. So while there will be further guidance coming out on this, I think that all you have to do is look at what the Presidents view has been for a long time -- that this is not something that the federal government should be involved in; this is a states' rights issue. Matt.Q  In the wake of the Vice Presidents trip to Europe, theres questions as to the administrations position on the future of the European Union with regard to a number of political movements across the continent advocating for the disbandment eventually of the European Union. I wanted to see if you could clarity the administrations position on the future of the European Union.MR. SPICER: I think the Vice President had great meetings with several European Union leaders and made it very clear to them that well continue to work with them, and reaffirmed our commitment to working with these nations. I mean, theres no update on that.Cecilia.Q  Thank you. On immigration, on the DHS memo, two parts, if I may. Is one of the goals here mass deportation?MR. SPICER: No, not at all. This isnt -- look, I think what we have to get back to is understanding a couple things. Theres a law in place that says if youre in this country illegally, that we have an obligation to make sure that the people who are in our country are here legally. What the order sets out today is ensures that the million-or-so people that have been adjudicated already, that ICE prioritizes, creates a system of prioritization, and makes sure that we walk through that system in a way that protects this country.This is consistent with everything the President has talked about, which is prioritizing the people who are here who represent a threat to public safety or have a criminal record. And all this does is lay out the exact procedures to make sure that that subgroup of people who pose a threat to our nation because of a conviction or a violation of public safety or have a criminal record are adjudicated first and foremost. That's it, plain and simple.Q  So is then -- a follow-up to that. Is the White House's message to date to undocumented people in this country whose only crime is being in this country illegally, ""Don't worry, or you're on notice""?MR. SPICER: No, the message from this White House and from the DHS is that those people who are in this country and pose a threat to our public safety or have committed a crime will be the first to go and we will be aggressively making sure that that occurs. That is what the priority is.Q  What about the others who aren't? They're watching this fearful right now.MR. SPICER: Cecilia, the President has said multiple times that we've got to look at this issue on a very, very holistic way. And the number-one priority when you look at the scope of how many people are in the country illegally, the number-one priority is making sure that people who pose a threat to this country are immediately dealt with. And this is not a small group of people; we're talking close to a million people who have already been adjudicated and had their status processed through a formal due process system.And so what we need to do now is to make sure that we focus the resources and the efforts on those people going first and foremost. And the factsheet and the information that we put out lays that out very, very clearly what is being done. But for so long, the people at ICE and CBP had their hands cuffed behind them. And when they were going to deal with the mission of their job, the last administration had so many carve-outs for who could be and who couldn't be adjudicated that it made it very difficult for the customs and enforcement people to do their job and enforce the laws of this country.But right now, what we've done is to make sure that they have the ability and the guidance and the resources to do what their mission is. And that's it, plain and simple. And the President is consistent with his priority of making sure that those people who pose a threat to this country are the first ones to go.Alexis.Q  Sean, on immigration, just to follow up, the President has a carve-out himself for DACA.MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q  Can you explain the process -- expand on what you were saying on Thursday about the process that the administration is taking to decide --MR. SPICER: And this is what I was basically talking to Cecilia about, which is the President has made clear when you have 12, 14, 15 million people in the country illegally, that there has to be a system of priority. And right now, ICE's priority is going to make sure that we focus first and foremost on that. Specifically, in the guidance, it talks about the DACA and DAPA, unless someone who fits under that program fits into the sub-category is not subject to what is being dealt with now.Remember, everybody who is here illegally is subject to removal at any time. That is consistent with every country, not just ours. If you're in this country in an illegal manner, that obviously there's a provision that could ensure that you be removed. But the priority that the President has laid forward and the priority that ICE is putting forward through DHS's guidance is to make sure that the people who have committed a crime or pose a threat to our public safety are the priority of their efforts, first and foremost.Katelyn.Q  John Kasich --Q  Let me follow. The President has also, and his team has also had reservations about undocumented people in the United States who are beneficiaries of public assistance or access to benefits, either at the state or the federal level. What is the President going to be doing to either issue guidance or executive action of some sort to indicate that he would like to preclude that from continuing?MR. SPICER: I think we have talked in the past about the respect that the President has for taxpayer money with respect to sanctuary cities and the enforcement measures that he's putting forward on immigration. Right now, obviously, the actions today are focused on people who are in this country and what we need to do on our southern border to facilitate the building of the wall that he's talked about. So we're doing this one step at a time in a very methodical way, and right now the focus is to make sure that ICE and CBP and DHS have the authority and the resources to carry out that first mission. We will have more -- and then continues to see that immigration is one of those issues that he was very, very clear and consistent on in the campaign, and we're going to continue to implement the policies that he talked about to keep the country safe.Katelyn.Q  Thank you. John Kasich has been a very vocal critic of President Trump, even in the campaign, saying his immigration plan was crazy, his statement that the elections were rigged was silly, and he did not endorse him and did not vote for him. What is the President hoping to accomplish with their meeting at the White House on Friday?MR. SPICER: So, Governor Kasich has reached out on multiple occasions to meet with the President to follow on, and the President has shown through the transition and since his time in office that he wants to meet with anybody that can help move this country forward and share in his vision. I think that includes people who are with him, who are not with him, who are on the other side of the aisle, who are independents, union workers, business leaders. Now that he is President -- and, frankly, I would again date it back to the transition -- he understands that he's the President for every American. And he's talked consistently about having a united country. And you do that by bringing people together, whether or not they agree with you on every issue, or one or two issues. But if there's common ground that can be found to move the country forward, then great. And I think so many of the President's priority issues are issues that Ohio is dealing with and that he wants to make sure that he can continue to work with Governor Kasich so that every American benefits.April.Q  Did Kasich ask for the meeting?MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Okay, what did the President gain from his tour today? You talked about where he visited, the exhibits that he visited. Did he also visit slavery? And the reason why I'm asking is, is because when he was candidate Trump, he said things like ""we made this country,"" meaning white America, and not necessarily black. Did he gain --MR. SPICER: I dont know why you would say that. What do you mean?Q  No, no, no, he said that. I heard him say that.MR. SPICER: No, no, but look -- the answer to your question is -- one of the first exhibits that he visited was one of the slavery exhibits. And the director walked him through some very amazing stories and statistics about where slavery was prevailing, not just in traditional Southern colonies but throughout the country. So they did have a very robust discussion about slavery early on in the tour. And I think that it was a very eye-opening and powerful tour for him, and, frankly, for every American. And I would encourage any American that can find the time and get in, because it's so popular. But it really is enlightening as far as parts of our history that people may not fully appreciate or know, and the contributions and the sacrifices that so many Americans have made that are a critical piece to our history that sometimes dont get the attention they deserve. So I think the President walked away from there -- and I mentioned in the remarks that he mentioned to Lonnie that he wanted to come back, because you can't do it justice. And it's much like the Holocaust Museum where you go through it once and then you sit there and start thinking of all the things that you saw, and think, you know, I'd like to go back and more fully explore what I saw because it piqued some degree of interest or intellectual curiosity. But he was very taken aback. Its a very, very powerful institution and tour, and it covers a lot of ground. I think he was really proud to share it with Dr. Carson. I mean, when you walk through that museum and you see all of the elements of our history, when you walk up to this one glass exhibit that is Dr. Carson's scrubs and pictures of him, and to experience that with him and his wife for the first time, and you realize how amazing that is for any American to be part of a Smithsonian, and you're standing with Dr. Carson and his wife where he is experiencing it with you for the first time and how powerful that must have been was, I think, a real interesting opportunity for him to sit there, hand to hand, with another American and watch them be part of American history. And you also appreciate some of the real contributions that Dr. Carson has made to medicine and the depth and breadth of his accomplishments.Q  And lastly, kind of putting this with the next question, is there any advancement on the CBC meeting with the President? And also, the head of the CBC said he was wondering if the President saw anything from current and past members of the CBC while he was in the museum, to get a little bit of information on them before this meeting happens.MR. SPICER: I'll have further updates on that. I know the President looks forward to that meeting, and I think that we're in the process of trying to begin setting that up. And so I'll have further updates on that once we get closer. I know that we've got some additional work before the month concludes on Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and some meetings that we're working on with them. But I want to get them locked in before I go further.Q  What did he think about the members that he saw in the museum?MR. SPICER: Well, when you walk through one of them, there's a big jumbotron, and we paused for a while, and John Lewis was there giving a very powerful speech. And we just paused and watched that for a little while. So, again, I think that, respectfully, when you walk through a museum like this there's a lot of moments where you're just stopping and taking it in, and there's -- if you havent been there, you walk up this one ramp and they stop and there's two big screens, and one of them is a video screen, and it's a massive jumbotron --Q  The civil rights --MR. SPICER: Right. And we watched the video of John Lewis talking there and describing his efforts in championing voting and civil rights.So I know the President paused and watched it and listened to it. And again, I would just go back to how he described his overall -- we didnt dissect the different things, but I watched him and it was a very powerful experience for him, and I know he looks forward to going back.Hallie.Q  Sean, two questions for you. First one on undocumented immigrants. You just made very clear that the President's priority is to deport those who pose a threat to public safety. MR. SPICER: Correct.Q  I know you're familiar with the case in Arizona of the mother, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos. Is she a threat to this country?MR. SPICER: I'm going to leave that up to ICE. We dont get involved from the White House to particular cases. That's not --Q  But she's a symbol --MR. SPICER: You're right, and I understand.Q  But is she a threat to public safety, though?MR. SPICER: But, Hallie, I think the answer is, is that ICE determined that she had violated the law in a way that was in accordance with this. Again, we've got to go back to this idea that our job, especially here at the White House, isnt to call balls and strikes and say, well, this person only violated part of the law, or let them go on this. If this was any other subject, if this was tax evasion and we said, well, they only really violated a little bit of -- they only cheated on their taxes a little, you wouldnt be saying hey, should they really be going to be prison or should they be getting a fine? At some point, laws are laws. And if people have a problem with the law, whether it's at the local, state or federal issue, then we should petition our lawmakers and the executive at that particular branch of government and change it. But our job shouldnt be to figure out should this individual not have to abide by the law, should this individual get a pass. If we want to change the law, we've got a very amazing process here in this country to both create and change laws.And so I dont want to comment on the specifics of any one case because I think that then puts the White House in a position of deciding who is following the law and who isnt, and who should get a pass. The bottom --Q  But isnt it different from you just said of prioritization of cases? There's a difference --MR. SPICER: No, no, there's a difference. When you have 13 or 14 million people, they're in the country -- you know, I think it's one thing to say prioritize people who pose a threat to public safety and go after this individual or that individual, or whatever. There's no question, you have to have priorities in anything -- what do you do first, what do you do second, what do you do third. And when you're talking about, 13, 14, 15, potentially more, millions of people in this country, the President needed to give guidance, especially after what they went through in the last administration where there were so many carve-outs that ICE agents and CBP members had to figure out each individual whether or not they fit in a particular category and they could adjudicate that case. The President wanted to take the shackles off individuals in these agencies and say: You have a mission, there are laws that need to be followed; you should do your mission and follow the law. And for specific cases, I would refer you to ICE in particular and do that.Q  Sean, where did you get the 13 and 14 million number?MR. SPICER: Hold on, Hallie is on number two.Q  Thank you.Q  The 13, 14 million number -- where did you get that number?MR. SPICER: Glenn, will you please not interrupt her?Q  Do you want to take that now?MR. SPICER: No, no, I think -- I'm not going to allow you to be interrupted.Q  So the second question is on the anti-Semitism comments that you referenced from the podium, the President made very clear. You said, though, that he has taken opportunities in the past. Just last week, though, he had the opportunities to deliver a message to the American people about anti-Semitism. He made very clear he was not anti-Semitic and he was, in fact, insulted by that. But as far as a broader message to the American people, he declined to offer one.  Is the President comfortable with his obligation as the leader of this country to deliver that kind of broad and forceful message to Americans? And if so, why didnt he do it sooner in the case of these attacks?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the idea, Hallie, that -- he has. And I think there's a point at which he talked literally on election night about uniting this country and making sure that all Americans, et cetera. And every time there's an instance, it's interesting -- I mean, I get a question, ""Is he going to denounce this one, is he going to denounce this one?"" At some point, the question is asked and answered. He has stood very forcefully against --Q  That's not what I'm asking. I'm not asking --MR. SPICER: What are you --Q  I'm asking, is he comfortable with his role as the person who needs to be delivering a broader message to America, not denouncing it, which he did clearly today.MR. SPICER: Right. And I think that he is very comfortable and understands that as the leader of the free world, the President of this country, the Commander-in-Chief, that he has an awesome responsibility to make it very clear where we're going as a country and what our values are, and that he has spoken very forcefully that we dont stand for this kind of behaviors, and words, and intolerance, that we are a country that should bring people together and that we shouldnt tolerate people who are hating on individuals because of their gender or because of their religion or the color of their skin, or a variety of other things, but that there's a point at which it's asked and answered. And I think the President has been very clear over and over again, going back through the campaign, the transition and now, that that's the kind of President that he wants to be, that's the kind of country that he wants to lead.Trey.Q  Thanks, Sean. Following the DHS memos this morning, the ACLU said the courts won't allow these orders to become a reality. How is the administration preparing for another potential legal battle? And do you have any response to the ACLU?MR. SPICER: Well, I think we have done a phenomenal job of working with the various departments, particularly DHS and DOJ, State, and through the White House staff, to make sure that we are well within any concerns that the court might have. And as I mentioned, I think it's important to continue to emphasize we feel as though the first one did that as well, and we were vindicated several times in the court. We have an issue with the 9th Circuit and I think we will overcome that, ultimately, on the merits. But in the meantime, a dual-track is something that we wanted to pursue to make sure that we do everything we can, as I mentioned before, to keep the country safe.Q  Sean, thank you. The Australian foreign minister is here today, meeting the Vice President.MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, say that again.Q  The Australian foreign minister is meeting the Vice President today and also the Secretary of State tomorrow. I guess we can assume that the U.S.-Australia refugee deal will come up. Now, last time we spoke, the President was still considering and reviewing a deal. Can you just update us on what the current position is?MR. SPICER: We'll have a readout of that.Q  And just --MR. SPICER: Okay, of course everyone gets two. (Laughter.)Q  If you could just update us on the current position on the deal. And also, given that recent exposure on the President's distaste for it, will Australia be expected to return the favor?MR. SPICER: Look, again, I would wait. We'll have a readout after that call as far as what they discussed. But I've got nothing -- I don't want to get ahead of the Vice President's meeting with either the Secretary of State or the Vice President.Kristen.Q  Thank you. I have two questions. One, on the immigration refugee executive order that we're expecting in the coming days, so that it withstands legal challenges, can you tell us what the language might look like as it relates to Syrian refugees?MR. SPICER: I appreciate the effort, but when we have it ready we'll get it out. And I think part of this is --Q  (Inaudible) ban on Syrian refugees?MR. SPICER: Excuse me? Again, I appreciate the second try, but we're not ready to announce it. And part of it is, is that we're making sure that it is completely ready to go. And so when we have that, we will get it out to you. And I would just -- the reason that we haven't announced it is it's not ready to be announced.Q  I want to try one more on --MR. SPICER: Of course. Q  -- the comments that the President made today about anti-Semitism. In terms of the timing, obviously he was asked about it, but they also came after his daughter, Ivanka, sent out that tweet. Has she counseled him? Was she one of the people saying it's important for you to forcefully denounce this? Why today?MR. SPICER: Because the President was visiting the African American Museum, he wanted to make it very clear. I think it was very powerful that, while there, and while understanding the struggles of so many -- and we talk about how one of the beauties of history is that we don't repeat itself. And I think that when you're at a museum like that and seeing the struggles that so many Americans faced and overcame, that you want to remind people that there is still issues that our country is grappling with and that there is no place for that hate and for that language.And I think -- as I mentioned, it was a very powerful opportunity for him to say that and to make clear, again, what his opinions were.Q  Does he regret not doing it last week, Sean?MR. SPICER: I'm sorry?Q  Does he regret not stating this comment last week?MR. SPICER: The President was very clear. That was a very -- I think, as I mentioned to Hallie, he has discussed this over and over again. I think there's a point to which his position is abundantly clear. His attempts and his desire and his rhetoric to unite the country has been expressed over and over again.Sarah.Q  Thanks, Sean. The New York Times is reporting that Trump's budget director is preparing a budget that eliminates the Export-Import Bank. But several lawmakers, including Senator Heitkamp, have come out of private meetings with President Trump and said that in those private meetings he expressed support for the export bank. So which is it? Does he support Ex-Im or does he support eliminating it?MR. SPICER: I can confirm that the OMB director -- the budget director is working on a budget. (Laughter.) Beyond that, I'm not going to get ahead of the OMB director right now. They are drafting a budget, they are talking to members of Congress and other interested parties about funding levels and such, but we're not at a position to go yet.Yes.Q  Sean, just wanted to circle on Alexis's question. Since the DHS guidance did not eliminate DACA, does that mean that the program is remaining in place, that it's a settled matter and it's not going away?MR. SPICER: No, Jordan. What it means is that this particular enforcement is tailored to what I have been referencing over and over again -- that what we're talking about today is the implementation of those two executive orders, one specifically that's tasking the agencies under DHS to address a very specific problem of the million or so, plus or minus, people that they have identified, that they have then adjudicated with already going through the process to be adjudicated and taken out of the country.Q  That means a decision on DACA could come any day.MR. SPICER: That's right, exactly. It just means that this -- what it means, more than anything, is that this order does not address that and it's very clear in the Q&A -- and, again, I would refer you back to DHS's website that has all of that.Goyal.Q  Thank you very much. Two questions please. One, it's been one month on the job for you and for the President, and you are already talk of the town around the globe. (Laughter.) My two questions are, one --MR. SPICER: My wife would disagree with you. (Laughter.) It's not always positive, too.Q  It looks like, Sean, that the President's order is working at least around the globe because more than 60,000 Pakistanis have been deported by Saudi Arabia. But they're saying that they were illegals and also they're a threat to the country. And also, at the same time, Pakistani government is arresting hundreds of terrorists inside the country. Any presidential message?MR. SPICER: Look, I'm not going to -- there's nothing that I have in terms of an update of what's going on in Pakistan. I would refer you to the Department of State with respect to specific policies. But the broader point that you're making is I think each country needs to look at what they need to do to control the people that are entering their country and keep their people safe.When you look at our laws in particular, and compare them to so many other countries around the globe, we actually tend to probably fall in the lower end of how tough our immigration policies are vis--vis someone else.Q  Sean, my second question.MR. SPICER: I'm sorry.Q  As far as illegal immigrants are concerned in the U.S., millions of illegal immigrants that were waiting for the last eight or ten years that they might see a light in the dark tunnel, and now theyre hoping that President Trump will have a light for them. So what is the Presidents message for them who are in this country for five, 10, 15 or 20 years but theyre not -- they dont have any criminal records?MR. SPICER: Well, look, the President has said before hes got a big heart. And I think that as we continue to develop policy on immigration, its going to be, as weve talked about in the past, prioritized -- what we go after first, second third. The President has made very clear he understands the plight of some of those individuals. Hes got a big heart. He understands the impact it has on many families, many communities.But we will continue to develop policies that will address that. And again, todays focus is specifically on those two executive orders, and Im going to limit it to that.Q  Sean, at the beginning of the month, Senator John McCain sent a letter to the President requesting that the administration provide arms to Ukrainians fighting Russian separatists within their country. When will the President respond to Senator McCains letter? And what is the administrations position on lethal aid to Ukrainians fighting Russian separatists?MR. SPICER: I dont have anything for you on that. Ill try to get back to you on that. I know that were very pleased to watch Senator McCain praise the pick of General McMaster. Thats obviously someone that we will consult with. But we were pleased to see so much support for him.Scott Newman (ph).Q  On Russia -- critics of the President have said that at time he doesnt talk tough enough on the subject. General McMaster, though, has been labeled by a lot of people as being pretty hawkish. Im curious what, if any, difference in tone or tenor or strategy we should expect now that theyre working together.Q  Well, I think, as I mentioned a couple times, I think there is widespread praise for General McMaster and his understanding and command of national security matters, foreign policy matters. Hes going to be a great asset to the Presidents national security team.But ultimately, the President has always been the decider, whether its Russia or any other issue. And I think youre right, he has made it very clear that if he can get a deal with Russia, something that the last several administrations have tried to do, that hes going to do it. And if he cant, he wont. But he is going to try. And I think his success as a businessman and negotiator should be seen as a positive sign for him to be able to do that.But he understands that if he can find common ground on defeating ISIS and combatting terrorism, growing the economy where we can find areas of economic interest, then were going to do it. But thats where were going to continue to work with Russia if we can. Hell get a deal. If he cant, he wont. But hes going to try. And I think where others have failed, hes going to make sure that he does everything possible to make sure that if its in the interest of the United States he will get a deal.Q  I have another question on General McMaster. So how much leeway is he going to get to restructure, to bring on his own people? There were some reports that Admiral Harward was not allowed to, or others as well. So can you address that?MR. SPICER: Thank you. I can. He will have 100 percent. The President has been very, very clear with that. He is the National Security Advisor, and he will have whatever he needs to implement a successful team. But with respect to Admiral Harward that you brought up, Admiral Harward made it very, very clear that he wanted this job, he would love to take it. He was impressed with the team. But during the course of discussions, it came up -- he said: Before I continue with this discussion, I need to address some financial and family concerns. He went back, he came back to us and said, I am unable to continue the discussions because of theres some financial concerns and some family issues that we have. I spent 40 years serving this country in the United States Navy.I talked to him again Saturday night, and he said: If theres another opening in a year or two, I would be honored, I am so impressed with the team thats there.And I would urge people to actually talk to him. He was so excited about being part of the team. He was available to as many reporters as he could take. We gave out his information -- his contact information. And hes been very clear. He wrote a letter to the President prior to -- first thing Tuesday morning. He was in the UAE, he sent the letter over and we had it first thing in the morning, where he said, because of family concerns, because of some financial constraints, having served this nation for 40 years, I cant take this job, but I'm unbelievably impressed. All of the rumors about the discretion that he would have over staff or any other thing were 100 percent false. He's made it clear that he would love to serve in the future, that he was impressed with the team, that he wanted to do this. There were just some constraints financially and family-wise that come with -- or after having served 40 years in the military, sacrifices both financially and family-wise that he had had to make. But I talked to him several times, and the team has talked to him. But ultimately, the President was very, very impressed with General McMaster. He had always been one of the individuals that he thought stood above so many other folks. He was impressed with the entire list, John Bolton and others. But so many people had spoken to him. General Mattis, Tom Cotton, other senators really praised General McMaster's command of the issues, his management, his style, his understanding of the geopolitical landscape. And I think that's why you saw such amazing widespread bipartisan praise for him, and why he will be such an asset to the national security team. So, ultimately, we ended up with the best choice. And I think that's going to benefit not just this administration but our entire nation.Q  Sean, can we expect him to get anyone else from the top of -- any senior people at the NSC?MR. SPICER: I'm sorry?Q  Can we expect that he may replace any others in the NSC?MR. SPICER: Again, I just can't be any clearer. I think that we've got an amazing team. He's been impressed with them. But the President has, as he did with other candidates, told them that they would lead the team and that he would have the discretion of it.Jeff.Q  I just wanted to follow on that. You said that he has the full authority to structure his office as he sees fit. Does that extend to the principals committee, as well? After he comes in and takes a look at the whole apparatus, if he advises the President and he would prefer not to have the chief strategist as a member of the principals committee, would the President --MR. SPICER: I think the President has made clear to him he's got full authority to structure the national security team the way he wants. Obviously, with something like that, he would come to the President and make that recommendation. But the President would take that under serious consideration. I dont want to go ahead with this person or that person or structure, but the President made it very clear with him and the other candidates that they had 100 percent control and authority over the national security committee.Thank you, guys. I'll see you tomorrow.Q  Will McMaster have to retire? Can you clarify that?MR. SPICER: No, he will stay on active duty. Q  Does that require Senate confirmation then?MR. SPICER: No. He will stay on active duty. That was the case with Powell and I think some other folks.Q  One more clarification just before you go. So when the new EO comes out, you won't rescind the original one and you'll leave it in place?MR. SPICER: That's correct. Yes. Thank you, guys.END2:41 P.M. EST",20743.0,,5865.95,,2365.38,

192,2017-02-21,Remarks by President Trump at the National Museum of African American History and Culture,"National Museum of African American History and CultureWashington, D.C.9:54 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, everybody. It's a great honor to be here. This was some beautiful morning and what a job they've done, like few others have been able to do. I am very, very proud of Lonnie Bunch. The work and the love that he has in his heart for what he's done is -- I always talk about you need enthusiasm, you need really love for anything you do to do it successfully. And, Lonnie, you are where? Come on. Where's Lonnie? You should be up here, Lonnie. Come on. And David -- we have to get David up here, too. David Skorton is tremendous and he was singing Lonnie's praises all morning long. So you two should at least be here. So we appreciate it very much. And David Rubenstein, who is here someplace, he is -- come on, David, you have to get up here, David. You certainly deserve it. He's a very, very successful guy who spends money doing great things, and he's been a great help to so many different groups and this one in particular. Thank you. It's a privilege to be here today. This museum is a beautiful tribute to so many American heroes -- heroes like Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Rosa Parks, the Greensboro students, and the African American Medal of Honor recipients, among so many other really incredible heroes.It's amazing to see. I went to -- we did a pretty comprehensive tour, but not comprehensive enough. So, Lonnie, I'll be back. I told you that. Because I could stay here for a lot longer, believe me. It's really incredible.I'm deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit. My wife was here last week and took a tour, and it was something that she's still talking about. Ivanka is here right now. Hi, Ivanka. And it really is very, very special. It's something that, frankly, if you want to know the truth, it's doing so well that everybody is talking about it.I know President Obama was here for the museum's opening last fall. And I'm honored to be the second sitting President to visit this great museum. Etched in the hall that we passed today is a quote from Spottswood Rice, a runaway slave who joined the Union Army. He believed that his fellow African Americans always looked to the United States as the promised land of universal freedom. Today and every day of my presidency, I pledge to do everything I can to continue that promise of freedom for African Americans and for every American. So important. Nothing more important.This tour was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms. The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil. I want to thank a great friend of mine, Dr. Ben Carson, and his beautiful family -- Candy and the whole family -- for joining us today. It was very special to accompany him and his family for the first time seeing the Carson exhibit. First time. Im so proud of you. I love this guy. Hes a great guy. Really a great guy. And he can tell you better than me, but Ill tell you what, we really started something with Ben. Were very, very proud of him. Hopefully, next week hell get his approval, about three or four weeks late -- and youre doing better than most, right? But the Democrats, theyll come along. I have no doubt theyll come along. But Ben is going to do a fantastic job at HUD. I have absolutely no doubt he will be one of the great -- ever -- in that position.He grew up in Detroit, and had very little. He defied every statistic. He graduated from Yale, and he went on to University of Michigans medical school. He became a brilliant -- totally brilliant -- neurosurgeon, saved many lives, and helped many, many people. Were going to do great things in our African American communities together. Ben is going to work with me very, very closely. And HUD has a meaning far beyond housing. If properly done, its a meaning thats as big as anything there is, and Ben will be able to find that true meaning and the true meaning of HUD as its Secretary. So I just look forward to that. I look forward to watching that. Hell do things that nobody ever thought of. I also want to thank Senator Tim Scott for joining us today. Friend of mine -- a great, great senator from South Carolina. I like the state of South Carolina. I like all those states where I won by double, double, double digits. You know, those states. But South Carolina was one, and Tim has been fantastic how he represents the people. And they love him.I also want to profoundly thank Alveda King for being here, and as we saw her uncles wonderful exhibit, and he certainly deserves that. Mrs. King -- and by the way, Ms. King, I can tell you this personally because I watch her all the time, and she is a tremendous fighter for justice. And so, Alveda, thank you very much.MS. KING: Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Come up here for a second.MS. KING: Yes, sir. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: I have been watching you for so long, and you are so incredible. And I wanted to thank you for all the nice things you say about me.MS. KING: Thank you, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Not everybody says nice things, but shes special.MS. KING: I love you and your family. Youre the best. Youre great.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Come here. MS. KING: Thank you. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, darling. Appreciate it.So with that, were going to just end this incredible beginning of a morning. But engraved in the wall very nearby, a quote by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1955, he told the world, We are determinedto work and fight until justice runs down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream. And thats what its going to be. Were going to bring this country together, maybe bring some of the world together, but were going to bring this country together. We have a divided country. Its been divided for many, many years, but were going to bring it together. I hope every day of my presidency we will be honoring the determination and work towards a very worthy goal. And for Lonnie, and David, and David, and Ben, and Alveda, and everybody, I just want to -- I just have to say that what theyve done here is something that can probably not be duplicated. It was done with love and lots of money, right Lonnie? (Laughter.) Lots of money. We cant avoid that. But it was done with tremendous love and passion, and thats why its so great.So thank you all very much for being here, I appreciate it. And congratulations. This is a truly great museum. Thank you.

194,2017-02-22,Remarks by President Trump in Budget Meeting,"Roosevelt Room12:39 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you all. This will be somewhat of an informal meeting. I want to congratulate Mick Mulvaney, whos been confirmed finally -- we waited a long time -- by the Senate. And hes going to be an absolutely great director. Total confidence in Mick. Known him for a long time. He loves those budgets. Unfortunately, the budget were inheriting -- essentially inheriting -- is a mess. The finances of our country are a mess. But were going to clean them up. Things that weve been doing, including negotiating deals that have already been negotiated, so you call it re-negotiating -- on airplanes and lots of other things, military items -- well end up either getting many more planes free, or were going to save a lot of money. But weve already saved a lot; billions and billions of dollars have been saved.We have enormous work to do as the national debt doubled over the last eight years. Our debt has doubled over a short period of time. I want the American people to know that our budget will reflect their priorities. Well be directing all of our departments and agencies to protect every last American and every last tax dollar. No more wasted money.Were going to be spending the money in a very, very careful manner. Our moral duty to the taxpayer requires us to make our government leaner and more accountable. We must do a lot more with less. And we must stop the improper payments and the abuses, negotiate better prices, and look for every last dollar of savings.Weve already imposed hiring freezes on nonessential government workers, and part of our commitment is to continue to do that for the American taxpayer. We have appointed a Cabinet that knows how to manage dollars wisely. Ive known many of the folks for a long time. Theyve been tremendous winners -- whether its Steve or Gary or another Steve, right here. And thats why I will direct them to manage the countrys dollars and your dollars very wisely. We wont let your money be wasted anymore. Were going to run government smoothly, efficiently, and on behalf of the very hardworking taxpayers -- something that the taxpayers havent seen in a long time. I will be holding everybody accountable for that, and I have no doubt that this group -- in particular, this group will do a fantastic job. I want to congratulate Steve Mnuchin as our new Secretary of the Treasury. Hes going to be outstanding. Tremendous track record -- he has a tremendous track record. I have great confidence in him.So were going to continue on, and were going to take this budget, which is -- in all fairness, Ive only been here for four weeks, so I cant take too much of the blame for whats happened. But it is absolutely out of control, and were going to do things that are going to be tremendous over the years. We have to take care of our military. We have no choice, we have to take care of our military. It needs work; its very depleted. And we have to take care of a lot of other things.Healthcare is moving along nicely. Its being put into final forms. As you know, before we do the tax -- which is actually very well finalized -- but we cant submit it until the healthcare, statutorily or otherwise. So were doing the healthcare. Again, moving along very well. Sometime during the month of March, maybe mid- to early March we will be submitting something that I think people will be very impressed by.And with that, were going to have a little meeting. And I think the press knows pretty much all of the people at the table, so thank you very much. We appreciate it.END12:43 P.M.

195,2017-02-22,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/22/2017, #14","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room12:55 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to wait until the President finished up with his remarks on the budget before I came out. As you saw, he's -- a really good opportunity to sit down with his team. It's clearly been a busy day here at the White House again, so I'm going to kind of keep it quick and get to your questions.This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Secretary of State Tillerson. As you all know, Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly will travel to Mexico City later today as one of their first foreign trips. Its significant that the President is sending the secretaries to Mexico so early in the administration.Its symbolic of the meaningful relationship that our two nations have. These are important meetings regarding the Presidents agenda to improve the quality of lives for both people of Mexico and the United States by combatting drug traffickers and finding ways to bolster both our economies through a broader relationship that promotes commerce and legal immigration. This is a very encouraging start to a working relationship with an incredible neighbor to the south.At this moment, the President has just wrapped up his discussions on the federal budget with some of the officials and staff who will be instrumental in the work to put this country back on a responsibly fiscal path.Joining the meeting were Reince Priebus, the Chief of Staff; Steve Bannon; Jared Kushner; Gary Cohn, the Director of the National Economic Council; Secretary Steve Mnuchin of the Department of Treasury; Director Mulvaney of the Office of Management and Budget; Russ Vought of the Office of Management and Budget; and Emma Doyle of Office of Management and Budget.As the President mentioned last week, we look forward to presenting our tax reform plan and providing much-needed tax reform and relief to the hardworking men and women of our nation. The President is going to restore and respect the American taxpayer by enabling them to keep more of their hard-earned money, and by making sure the federal government spends money more responsibly. After the lunch, the President will continue this important discussion with other members of the senior staff.Additionally, the Vice President today is in St. Louis to participate in listening sessions with American workers and employees of the Fabick Cat equipment and engineer* [engine] dealer, a 100-year-old family-owned and operated business.During his visit, the Vice President will discuss the economic comeback in store for our nation under the Presidents economic agenda and with small business owners and employees. The President has already made strides towards slashing redundant regulations through his executive actions, and we will work with Congress to enact further pro-growth legislation.Back to the Presidents schedule. Later this afternoon, the President will participate in his standing legislative affairs strategy session. Our legislative affairs team is in constant contact with our counterparts on the Hill, keeping an open dialogue on all aspects of the Presidents agenda. Last week alone, more than 40 different senators and members of Congress visited the White House.On the Supreme Court front, so far Judge Gorsuch has met with 58 senators -- 36 Republicans and 22 Democrats -- and he has more meetings already on the books for next week when the Senate returns to session. Weve been especially encouraged by the reception hes received from several senior Democrats, including Senators Feinstein, Tester, Durbin, and Gillibrand.Also on the confirmation front, multiple unions came out today for Alex Acosta, the Presidents nominee for Labor Secretary. Both the Laborers' International Union of North America and the International Union of Operating Engineers praised his distinguished career and pledged their support for his nomination.The legislative affairs team is using the congressional work period to coordinate with key coalitions in Congress. They are meeting with different groups in the House and Senate, including the staff of the Congressional Black Caucus, House and Senate leadership, and staff throughout various committees. Weve used this work period as an opportunity to invite staffers from both sides of the aisle to come to the White House and discuss shared priorities and find common ground on the way forward.And were not just reaching out to Capitol Hill, we've actively engaged with key leaders and policymakers around the country. Its critical to this administration that we gather input from states and from people throughout the country, rather than just leaders here in Washington.Looking ahead to tomorrow, the President will meet with a group of world-class business leaders to discuss specific actions he can take to remove barriers to job creation. These leaders, many of whom represent some of the countrys largest manufacturers, will begin the day in working groups with the Vice President, Cabinet members and key aides of the Presidents staff. The working groups will engage in a deep-dive conversation on the attendees specific areas of expertise. Topics of discussion include deregulation, tax and trade, training and the workforce of the future, and infrastructure.Vice President Pence will be engaged with each of the groups. And after the groups conclude their discussion, the Presidents staff will compile the feedback and the President will sit down with the entire group for a listening session on some of their recommendations.As you can tell by the structure of the meeting, the President is expecting these interactions to lead to real action being taken by the administration. Creating a dynamic and booming economy that works for all Americans continues to be at the top of his domestic policy agenda. As a successful businessman himself, the President knows that if were going to get the country back to work, we need to hear directly from job creators what is holding them back, and, where appropriate, take steps to remove the barriers.In his first month in office, the President has already taken numerous actions to boost job creation, and key economic indicators are showing that its working. CEO and [consumer] confidence are up, the stock market continues to reach record highs, and the January numbers were strong. The meetings on Thursday will continue to build on that momentum.And with that, Im glad to take some questions. Steve Holland.Q  Steve Holland is not here.MR. SPICER: Sorry, Jeff Mason gets it. (Laughter.) Q  Thank you, Sean. Can you give us an update on the administration's plans with regard to transgender bathrooms in schools? And can you confirm that there has been some disagreement between Secretary DeVos and the Attorney General on this issue?MR. SPICER: So I would expect further guidance to come out on that today. The President, as I said yesterday, is a firm believer in states' rights. When you look at the guidance that was issued under the Obama administration -- first of all, let's remember, to the best of my knowledge, that was stalled and never fully implemented. And I think there were various reasons for that -- several legal reasons and several procedural reasons. And so the Department of Education and the Department of Justice, both who jointly issued that guidance back during the Obama administration, are now working together again under a Trump administration, they've been reviewing the guidance that was signed, the basis by which it was put through. And I think there have been several areas of concern, both legal and procedural, that they have been discussing. And I think where you might be hearing something is more on the timing and the wording of stuff. The conclusions, everybody in the administration is agreed upon. There is no daylight between anybody -- between the President, between any of the Secretaries. I think there has been some discussion between the timing of the issuance and recommendations, or between the exact wording. But as far as the conclusions go, I've made this clear and the President has made it clear throughout the campaign that he is a firm believer in states' rights and that certain issues like this are not best dealt with at the federal level.Q  Sean, a report out today that some Cabinet Secretaries are bristling at what they see as the White House micromanaging staffing at the sub-Cabinet level. To what degree does the White House think that it should impose its hiring approvals on members of the sub-Cabinet? And is some of this at least partially driven by Cabinet Secretaries wanting to appoint people who might not necessarily be aligned with the President's thinking?MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think when you come to -- they're called political appointees for a reason. The idea is that people who come into this government should want to support and enact the President's agenda that he campaigned on with the American people. And I think one of the reasons that you see in recent polls the President -- people, even if they don't agree with the President, they give him high marks for following through on the promises that he's made to the American people and getting things done that he actually said, which is not always the case here in Washington.And I think that we want to make sure that the people who staff a Trump administration are committed to a Trump agenda, and that's -- so Cabinet Secretaries and other administrators and directors have broad discretion. But I think at the end of the day, no matter what position you have -- whether it's the lowest or the highest in the White House or in a department or agency -- we should be making sure that people who are coming in as appointees of the President support the President's agenda. And I think that's one thing -- this isn't about getting a job as a federal employee where you're subject to certain restrictions as to what you can and can't do as a benefit of being a federal employee. These are political appointees, and so I think that there is obviously -- we are going to ensure that people who are political appointees share the vision and agenda that the President campaigned on and is implementing.Q  And does the White House believe that it needs to have the final approval of these people or can you trust your Cabinet Secretaries to --MR. SPICER: It's not a question of trust. It's a question of just making sure that we're all on the same page and committed to the same agenda that the President has set forth. This process is probably no different than we've seen in previous administrations. Cabinet Secretaries come to the President with recommendations on who they want, and it depends on the position, obviously. But in certain cases, if they're going to fulfill a job that is a key area that the President had very specific goals to enact that he promised the American people, you want to make sure that the person that is fulfilling that job actually is committed to the agenda and the vision that the President set forth and promised the American people. And that's -- so there is -- that's something that we're always going to be making sure is in alignment.Q  And is this approval process in some way slowing down the appointment of crucial staffers?MR. SPICER: No. No, not at all. I don't think so. I think when you look across where we are and we track the number of folks that are in the pipeline, we're doing very, very well with getting all of these positions filled. And I think once in a while, you might hear of one or two people, but overall, generally speaking, I mentioned during the transition period how many members of the beachhead teams that we had, and I think we -- those members who are appointed through the beachhead process had 120 days. And they were there to allow basically a four-month process for Secretaries in the White House to make sure that people on a permanent basis could populate those positions. And that's what's happening.But make no mistake -- I mean, we were ahead of the curve on the beachhead teams. We were very clear with the landing teams during the transition. This has been a very methodical process that has seen from top to bottom through, and I think we're doing a phenomenal job of staffing the government.Margaret.Q  Thank you. Oh, which Margaret?MR. SPICER: Oh, lucky me. (Laughter.) Q  Two Margarets. I'm going to take mine -- I've got a Bloomberg-y question for you. (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: I've got a Sean-y answer for you. (Laughter.)Q  The President in the Roosevelt Room just said to us that, among other things, that the tax plan is nearly finalized but it can't be submitted until the healthcare plan statutorily or otherwise is, so we're doing the healthcare. So what I wanted to clarify was, is the White House doing a healthcare proposal, or was he talking about Congress and not the White House? Or is there a new plan?MR. SPICER: Well, obviously -- right. So obviously there's two vehicles -- reconciliation vehicles that -- FY17 -- I'm going to give you a Bloomberg-y answer. (Laughter.) The FY17 reconciliation, that was never completed because the budget wasn't finalized in the last Congress. And then youve got the 2018. I think we want to make sure -- look at the opportunities to work with Congress on Obamacare, utilizing the 2017, and then you could utilize the 2018 reconciliation and budget process to do tax reform.Thats not -- and again, thats not prescriptive. Im not -- but as far as why the President is saying it that way is because weve got that option available to us right now, and I think the President is committed to making sure that the promise that he made to the American people to repeal and replace Obamacare continues to be first and foremost, and then his tax plan.But its not a we can walk and chew gum kind of thing. We can actually be continuting to work with Congress and the leadership in both Houses.Q  President Obama used to say that. Just to do the Bloomberg-y timeline, theres a few things that are going to happen then. Theres going to be a budget plan that you guys are going to present on March 13th-ish.MR. SPICER: Ish. (Laughter.) Q  Theres going to be a healthcare -- this is where I got lost again -- something from him and something from them, and a tax reform plan afterwards? Is that the way it works?MR. SPICER: I dont want -- look, when were ready to announce stuff -- but I think again, I think youve got Obamacare, the budget, and tax reform. Its going to be a very busy March and April for us. And weve been continuing to work with Congress to make sure that thats implemented. Noah Bierman.Q  Does the President -- you were talking about fulfilling his promises. As you know, he promised during the campaign a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country. There were a lot of people in his party who thought that was a very good proposal. Can you explain his evolution in backing down from that? And can you also say whether he regrets using that rhetoric, since it ended up hurting the court case?MR. SPICER: Well, again, Id go back to the merits of the case and the order that gives him the authority to make that. U.S. Code 1182 is very clear. The President was very clear in his executive order that these were countries that we didnt have the proper vetting for when it came to ensuring the safety of Americans.Thats what the executive order said. The authority is very clear to have done it. And I think that youre going to continue to see the President take the steps necessary to protect this country. Thats why hes talked about fighting this on both fronts, making sure that we keep evolving through the court system on the existing EO, and then looking towards the next draft of the executive order that will continue to achieve the goal of protecting the American people.So thats where we are. Thats what the order says. And then so I think we continue to feel confident that thats -- but it was crafted in a way that was very clear about the countries, and was not focused on anything else but the vetting requirements that we have to make sure that we know whos coming into this country and that theyre here not to do us any harm.Q  But when talking about fulfilling his promises, can you explain why he decided to back down from that one? Because I know you differentiated this from that promise.MR. SPICER: I think hes made it very clear, Noah, from the beginning that this was a country-focused issue, a safety-focused issue, and thats why he issued it. I dont see anything other than that with reference to that.Debra Saunders.Q  Hi. The Oscars are Sunday night. Will the President be watching? If theres a Meryl Streep kind of moment, how do you think hell react? And why -- if this has happened at other awards ceremonies, why do you think this happens?MR. SPICER: Why do I think what happens? (Laughter.)Q  Actresses and actors like Meryl Streep.MR. SPICER: I have no idea. Its a free country. I think Hollywood is known for being rather far to the left in its opinions. And Ive got to be honest with you, I think the President will be hosting the Governors Ball that night. Mrs. Trump looks forward to putting on a phenomenal event, and the First Lady has put a lot of time into this event thats going to occur in welcoming our nations governors to the Capitol. And I have a feeling that thats where the President and the First Lady are going to be focused on on Sunday night, and so well go from there.Q  Sean, the President is going to have a big audience next Tuesday in the joint address to Congress. Does he have a set of goals in mind for the speech? And do you think were going to see some specific policy rollouts as part of that speech?MR. SPICER: I think that the speech is going to focus -- I mentioned this yesterday -- I think its going to talk -- remind the American people what hes done already, and make sure that he explains to them not just because of a sense of accomplishment in moving this country forward, but because I think its important for the American people to know that he was an agent of change, he came here to get things done, and he didnt waste any time.Hes committed to keeping his word. And then I think hes going to lay out his vision and talk about things like education and healthcare and infrastructure, the problems that we face as a country, the violence in some of our inner cities, but also some of the solutions that we can act on and some of the partnerships that we can create. Its obviously still a work in progress.But I think its going to look forward to where he wants to take this country and talk about working with Congress and other leaders throughout the country to get things done. But I think in the drafts that Ive seen so far, it is going to be a very strong blueprint of where he wants to take this country. In the past, I think a lot of presidents -- or some presidents, rather, have gotten into very detailed specifics. I think youre going to see him try to talk about policies in a broad sense of where he wants to take this country and what defining success is, what that goal means. But its still a work in progress, and hopefully towards the end of the week --Q  Is the tone going to be optimistic, sunny?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think this is an opportunity for him to lay out a very positive vision for the nation and to really let America know where we can go and how we can get there, and the potential that we have as a nation.Anita.Q  Just piggybacking on that, and then I have another question. Will he -- I know past presidents, including President Obama, immediately hit the road after -- I know this isnt a State of the Union, but something like a State of the Union address to sell policies. And since youre saying its more of a vision, does he anticipate doing -- going out --MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think there will be some travel. I don't want to -- that's evolving right now. Theres a lot of things that we're trying to look at. And I think as we look at the speech and some of the objectives and goals and vision that hes sharing, talk to him about potential places to go to highlight that. But I think you're going to see a fair amount of visits in the next few weeks to highlight some of the places that he wants to take them.Q  And then the other thing was, I've seen -- some members of Congress were here last week. Theres the legislative meeting today. It feels as if we havent seen as many executive actions -- or executive orders. I know we have the one -- vetting one coming out this week. Are we in a different phase now that hes sort of done the executive orders that he wants to do --MR. SPICER: No.Q  -- and we're going to legislation?MR. SPICER: We have several that are in the pipeline. And part of it is just -- these days are focused with these meetings and getting things done and trying to plan ahead. And so as we see fit and as the implementation process of a lot of these goes through the process, well have future -- well have plenty more. But --Q  It does seem that there's more legislative emphasis right now.MR. SPICER: Well, its both. And I think part of this is as we work through Congress, Anita, these are big things, right? We're talking about fundamental tax reform -- something that hasnt happened in our nation since 1986. The repeal and replacement of Obamacare, which was mammoth.And I think part of this is that those things take time. Hes got a joint address on Tuesday. Theres a lot of things that are happening, and therefore we need to kind of make sure that we appropriately use the schedule. But I can assure you that if you've missed executive orders, you're going to see a bunch -- Q  (Inaudible.)MR. SPICER: (Laughter.) I know. I just want to make sure you know.Jonathan Karl.Q  I want to ask you about the town halls, and we're hearing about Obamacare. The President referred to so-called angry crowds at these town halls. Is he suggesting this is manufactured anger, that this is not real anger and real concern?MR. SPICER: Thanks. I think theres a hybrid there. I think some people are clearly upset. But there is a bit of professional protestor, manufactured base in there. But obviously there are people that are upset. But I also think that when you look at some of these districts and some of these things, that it is not a representation of a members district or -- it is a loud group, small group of people disrupting something, in many cases, for media attention. No offense.Its just -- I think that necessarily -- just because they're loud doesn't necessarily mean that there are many. And I think in a lot of cases that's what you're seeing. Q  Does the President doubt that there is real anger --MR. SPICER: No, I just said that.Q  -- and real concern out there beyond just a few loud agitators, that theres real concern that people may lose their healthcare?MR. SPICER: But see, I think that that's a false narrative. And I don't -- the President has been very clear. Look, you have to look at what our healthcare system is right now. In so many counties around our nation, we've gone down to one provider. That's not choice. That's not access. And then they're going in a lot of cases and they're saying, we're not taking Medicaid, we're not taking TRICARE, we're not taking the insurance you used to have; the doctor that you used to have isnt participating anymore. And, oh, by the way, states like Arizona, you've got over 100 percent increase in premiums -- 112 [percent] I think was the number there. In many states, its double, triple -- double-digit. And I think that the idea that we have to remember is that the American people got sold the Affordable Care Act -- its neither affordable or accessible. They're losing their coverage and premiums are spiking. And so if people are truly worried about losing their coverage, they should be applauding the Presidents action for wanting to make sure that we put a system in place that does what they were supposed to have been promised a while back. And I think that's -- that's what I think is missing from this dialogue. Ive seen some folks that were protesting in some of these things saying, I lost -- Im on Obamacare, Im going to lose my thing. And when they were asked how old they were, they were, oh, Im 71, 72. Well, they're not on Obamacare. -- they're on Medicaid.Q  So you think you're making it up?MR. SPICER: No, not they're making it up. But what Im getting at it is I think that there is a lot of blurring of the facts. And the reality is that some people arent on Obamacare. They're on an employer-based system. They're on Medicaid. They're receiving their benefits through Medicare because of their age. And so they're in -- nothing. They have no problems.But I think in other cases, people are now being told that the plan that they're on is unsustainable; that these carriers throughout the country -- I mean, you just look at them, over and over again pulling out of the exchanges. The reality is, is that they are losing their healthcare, but they're losing it under Obamacare because the exchanges are collapsing on themselves. Carriers are pulling out. Premiums are going up. And access is going down.So the President's plan is actually going to do exactly what they were promised eight years ago and didn't get. So for those who are worried, the answer is: Help is on the way.Q  But what is the plan? We haven't seen what he's going to replace it with.MR. SPICER: First, as the President made clear, we're going to have that out in the next couple weeks. He's working on it. But the goal, Jonathan, is this got jammed through a Democratic Congress, and then they told us you could read it after we get it passed. So taking our time, getting this right to achieve the goals that we set forth is probably the right thing to do, considering the experience that we had the last time.Hallie.Q  Sean, two questions for you. The issue of transgender bathrooms wasn't one we heard a lot about from the President during the campaign. He said at one point, Caitlyn Jenner could use whichever bathroom she wanted to at Trump Tower. So why is this now a priority for the administration 40 days into office?MR. SPICER: It's not a priority. I think there's a case --Q  But It's one of the first things --MR. SPICER: But let me answer the question. It's not a priority. There is a case pending in the Supreme Court in which we have to decide whether or not to continue to issue guidance to the Court. It's dictated by that.The Obama administration had issued joint guidance from the Department of Education and the Department of Justice. We now have to decide whether or not this administration wants to continue that track that they were on. It's plain and simple. If we don't -- but there are problems, both in the legal and process way, in which that guidance was issued. And so it's incumbent upon us to actually follow the law and to recognize that Title IX never talked about this. It was enacted in 1972. There was no discussion of this back then. And to assume certain elements of the law were thought of back then with respect to this would be completely preposterous.Q  And to be clear, Secretary DeVos is onboard with this?MR. SPICER: Yes, 100 percent. Thank you.Q  Sean, that was actually a clarification. The second question is on Mexico. The Secretary of State's trip that is tonight along with Secretary Kelly, obviously there have been tensions, right, between the Mexican President and President Trump. Is this a clean-up job for the Secretary of State?MR. SPICER: No. I think that President Pea Nieto and President Trump spoke -- again, the foreign ministers had several contacts with our staff. I would argue that we have a very healthy and robust relationship with the Mexican government and Mexican officials, and I think they would echo that same sentiment. President Pea Nieto has echoed that as well.But I think the relationship with Mexico is phenomenal right now, and I think there's an unbelievable and robust dialogue between our two nations.Margaret, and then I'll get you.Q  On Syria, General Votel indicated today that the U.S. needs to take a larger share of the burden and perhaps send troops to Syria. Has the President discussed this with his national security team? And when does he --MR. SPICER: I'm going to refer you back to DOD on that. I would just argue that I think that you've seen the President talk about safe harbors in Syria with several foreign leaders who have shared his --Q  Safe havens.MR. SPICER: Safe havens, thank you. And that is an area at the top of the President's foreign policy agenda that he has continued to talk to leaders, especially in the Middle east, about, trying to make sure that we deal with that issue in that area right now. But I'm not going to get ahead of the DOD on this. And then when they have recommendations, they'll make them forward to us.Q  Is there an NSC -- has the President spoken to --MR. SPICER: Look, I will -- if I have an update, I'll give it to you tomorrow.Go ahead.Q  President Trump and the Canadian Prime Minister launchedthe U.S. and Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs. Can you talk a little bit about how the council is growing and transpiring? What's the status of it?MR. SPICER: I think staff is beginning to implement the President's agenda. It occurred, what, six, seven days ago. And so it's starting to work through the process and we'll have further updates as it goes forward. But I know that he continues to be in touch with Prime Minister Trudeau, and our staff continues to work on the back end to make this happen.Zeke.Q  Thanks, Sean. I have two questions for you. One, earlier in your conversation with Jon, does the White House not have confidence in its Cabinet Secretaries if it's looking sort of over their shoulders? Does the White House not -- does the President not trust his Cabinet Secretaries, appointees and agency administrators to staff -- to find people who agree with the President's agenda?MR. SPICER: No, not at all. I think there's a big difference. The President named these folks because they're unbelievably qualified individuals. Part of it, though, is that you're staffing major departments and I think we've got somewhere in the area of 5,000 positions to fill. And when you're filtering through a good number of people, I don't even think the Secretaries, at some degree, depending on the department, have a full background on some of these individuals.And so as they get pumped through the pipeline, there are questions. And, again, there are areas that are of key priority to the President that he campaigned on. And I think that when he wants to make sure that certain of those individuals who are going to be overseeing key priorities that he promised the American people have somebody who is not only qualified but agrees with and shares the President's vision to fix whatever problem that was or fulfill whatever vision that he articulated.But I think that that -- I mean, it would almost be malpractice not to do that. To allow people to fill a job, a political appointee job, who don't share the vision and agenda of the President of the United States would almost be -- I mean, it would be silly on its face to suggest this.I don't think there's any administration in past history that would literally, willingly, take on somebody who was adamantly opposed or spoke out specifically against what the President was seeking to do, and then have them fulfill a job to carry out that mission. It just -- it doesn't seem as though it makes any sense.Yes.Q  Second thing real quick. We're coming up on a week away from the deadline the President ordered for his review of the counter-ISIS strategy. Whats the status of that review? The President tweeted over the weekend that he was meeting with a bunch of generals.MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Is that regarding that review?MR. SPICER: I think General Dunford and Secretary Mattis have begun providing him updates on that. I know that the new National Security Advisor is getting brought into that process and continuing to do updates, so well have further updates. But the team has been working on it since the President issued the guidance.Yes.Q  As far as the second executive order is concerned, what is the White House doing differently in terms of consulting with various departments to make certain that this second executive order passes constitutional scrutiny?MR. SPICER: Well, I think we've done a few things. One is, I think we've been very clear about understanding what the court said in trying to tailor that specifically while achieving the same goals of keeping America safe and ensuring that people don't come into this country that seek to do us harm. That's number one.Number two is, we continue -- and that order is basically completed. I think what we're now doing is working with the various agencies and departments to make sure that the implementation of that is done in an extremely smooth way. So we have looked at it from both a process standpoint, as well as a legal standpoint. And I think its achieving the goals.But again, I would also mention that, on the merits, I believe that the first order did just that. It was written in a way -- and I think ultimately we will continue to prevail on that -- because it is written in a way that is clear and consistent with U.S. code and the authority that the President has to protect the nation.Katie.Q  Sean --Q  No matter what happens, as it relates to the second executive order, its almost likely to face a legal challenge.MR. SPICER: Sure.Q  Are you concerned that the Presidents prior remarks as it relates to the judiciary is going to allow him to get a fair hearing by the judicial branch as it relates to the second executive order?MR. SPICER: Yeah, absolutely. I think that --Q  Why do you say that?MR. SPICER: Because I think that you've seen it happen in the Massachusetts case. I mean, at the end of the day, you look at the law and what the order does. And I think, again, you may have -- in the case of the 9th Circuit, we continue to disagree with that. I think the President has pointed out you don't have to be that high up in grade school to recognize what the code says, what the authority that is granted to him, and then what the order does.I think the things that they brought out in that order -- in one of the cases, they suggested there have been no people that have entered within the seven countries. And a quick cursory look found upwards of close to 20 people that had come in. So some of the basis for which they decided the case on doesn't actually pass muster. And I think any other judge or judges that look at that order or the one that will be put forward will come to the same conclusion.Katie.Q  Sean, I wanted to ask about the Presidents budget priorities. What specifically is the President increasing spending on? Where is he decreasing spending? And how much money specifically is he asking for the 5,000 new Border Patrol agents hes asked for?MR. SPICER: So Im going to refer you back to Margarets question, and then well have something in mid-March as we put that out. But Im not going to get ahead of Director Mulvaney.Q  (Inaudible.)MR. SPICER: No, I mean, its not -- look, he just had a meeting where hes continued to work that out. They're providing him back-and-forth. That's the idea of crafting this budget. And until we put it out on paper, I don't want to get ahead of --Q  Sean, can I follow up on Mexico?MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Thank you very much. Back to Mexico -- Videgaray and many officials have said this morning that they're not going to accept the directives that were put out by the White House and by DHS yesterday, and they may not take anyone that's not a Mexican immigrant. What are you guys doing to do with those people that Mexico will not accept?MR. SPICER: I think Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly are going to have a great discussion down there, and to walk through the implementation of the executive order. But I feel very confident that any country who has a citizen that comes into this country, and that we send back, well make sure that they comply with this.David.Q  Two questions about immigration. One, the President has talked a number of times about millions of illegal immigrants casting votes during the election, in his mind. You guys have promised to look into that. It seems like there was no mention of that in any of these directives, to look for these immigrants. Does the President still believe this is a national security problem?MR. SPICER: Yeah, and Vice President Pence will lead a task force on this.Q  Where would we stand on that, though?MR. SPICER: He named a task force, and the Vice President is starting to gather names and individuals to be part of it.Q  On the other question I had about the DACA program, yesterday you suggested, well, we have to go after hardened criminals and major national security threats first. But during the campaign, the President talked about DACA as being an unconstitutional executive amnesty. Does he still think it was an unconstitutional use of President Obamas powers? And if so, does he plan --MR. SPICER: I think -- yeah, I think -- and I said this yesterday: The President is very clear about his priorities with respect to immigration. Yesterday was focused on going after people who are a concern -- a public safety concern. And we're going to walk through this very --Q  -- unconstitutional?MR. SPICER: We will get back to you on that. Right now the focus is on keeping the country safe and making sure that we walk through.Shane.Q  I want to ask on immigration, as well. Given all of the push on deporting illegal immigrants, I wanted to see if this White House and President Trump have any interest in curtailing legal immigration going forward.MR. SPICER: Again, we got to look at this from a priority level. Right now theres millions of people in this country that are in the country illegally. I think the focus continues to be that 800,000 or 900,000 that have already had an order to have them removed and get them processed through in a way that continues to keep America safe.Legal immigration, obviously, is a completely separate subject, and that includes visa reform and all that other stuff. The President has talked about that. Hes talked about it with business leaders -- H-1B visas, et cetera. You're going to see more of that coming. But I think there is a prioritization of how we deal with immigration -- both illegal and then legal. And well have more on that later.I got to run. Thank you, guys, very much. Well see you tomorrow. Take care.END1:30 P.M. EST",20775.6,32.599999999998545,5860.63,-5.319999999999709,2362.82,-2.5599999999999454
196,2017-02-22,Remarks by the Vice President to Fabick Cat Employees,"Fabick Cat FactoryFenton, Missouri2:46 P.M. ESTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Governor Greitens.

Thank you, its a privilege to have you here.I also want to thank all the small business owners who are with us today, including our host Doug Fabick and the Fabick family -- 100 years in business here in Missouri creating jobs and opportunities. (Applause.) Congratulations.I enjoyed our discussion earlier today, and I appreciate your candid feedback, Doug, and the candid feedback that we got from other business leaders and job creators all across this region. And on that note, let me say thank you to all the great employees here at Fabick Cat for coming out today. Hardworking men and women, you're the ones that make companies like this grow. You are the strength in the American economy, and you're going to lead an American comeback. (Applause.)As President Trump has said so many times, it was too long that we had forgotten men and women in this country. Well, the forgotten men and women, the men and women who carry this economy on their shoulders everyday are forgotten no more. And on behalf of President Trump, I thank all the hardworking men and women of Fabick Cat who are here today. Thanks for doing a great job for this country and this community. (Applause.)Now, before we get started Id like to address something that happened here in St. Louis over the weekend. On Monday morning, America awoke to discover that nearly 200 tombstones were toppled in a nearby Jewish graveyard.Speaking just yesterday, President Trump called this a horrible and painful act, and so it was. That along with other recent threats to Jewish community centers around the country -- he declared it all a sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.We condemn this vile act of vandalism and those who perpetrate it in the strongest possible terms. (Applause.)And let me say its been inspiring to people all across this country to see the way the people of Missouri have rallied around the Jewish community with compassion and support. You have inspired the nation with your kindness and your care. (Applause.)It just so happens three days ago, my wife and my daughter were overseas. We saw firsthand what happens when hatred runs rampant in a society. We were near Munich, Germany, where we visited the very first Nazi concentration camp ever to be constructed, a place called Dachau.We were accompanied by a survivor of Dachau, a 93-year-old man named Abba Naor, who told me he had arrived there as a 17-year-old boy. He described, as we walked through that memorial, the hellish life he endured -- toiling away as a slave while those around were taken away, one by one, never to return.By the grace of God, he survived, and now he tells his story so that the world will never forget.But before we left, he spoke words that touched my heart and Ill always carry with me throughout my life, and they resonate with this moment today. He spoke of that hellish existence in the waning days of the war, and then he looked up at me with a smile, and he said: Then the Americans came. (Applause.)He spoke of the kindness of those American soldiers who liberated that camp, and he pointed a finger at me and told me when you go back, you thank every one of those soldiers for what they did for me and for my people and for my country.Would you join me in a round of applause for every man and woman here who has worn the uniform of a United States of America? We are proud of you, and we are grateful to you. (Applause.)The American solider fought to end the hatred and violence against the Jewish people across Europe then, and as President Trump said yesterday, American will always, in his words, fight bigotry, intolerance, and hatred in all its ugly forms -- wherever it will arise. That's the American way. (Applause.)Now, thank you for letting me share that from my heart. But let me get on to what I came here to talk to you about. It is great to be back in Missouri. (Applause.)I was here last September for a rally, and it was absolutely electric. Two months later, the Show Me State showed America what it was made of when you helped make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America. Thank you, Missouri. (Applause.)The President and I will always be grateful for what you did for us and what you did for this country. Americas small businesses were actually some of our biggest supporters. Small business owners across the land saw in this businessman who would become President someone who had the ideas and the energy and the vision to make America great again. Hardworking Americans who make small businesses successful, folks like everyone here today, rallied behind this cause, and we brought real change to our nations capital. Fabick Cat is a true American success story. As I mentioned before, a family-owned business owned and operated since its founding back in 1917. Today -- thanks to all of you -- Fabick Cat has 1,100 employees at 37 locations throughout the Midwest. So many people rely on what you do. And, frankly, Doug, what you and the family has done here for a hundred years has made Missouri great, and its going to be a part of making America great again. (Applause.) And I want to tell you, to all the small business owners who are here today, just know that President Trump is your biggest fan. (Applause.) Ill make you a promise: President Trump is the best friend Americas small businesses will ever have. (Applause.) He asked me to be here today to tell you how much he appreciates what you do for the country. Make no mistake about it, America finally has a President whos going to support and fight for you every single day. You know, both of us know that small businesses are the engine of our economy. Theyre the beating heart that creates jobs and prosperity and growth. I grew up in a small business and in a small town, a family-owned business in Columbus, Indiana. I went to work at one of my dads gas stations when I was only 14 years or age. I was a gas station attendant. For those of you under 30, just imagine. (Laughter.) Just imagine if when you pulled into a gas station, somebody ran out with their name on their shirt, pumped your gas, washed your windows, checked you tires and didnt charge you any more money for it. (Laughter.) Thats what I did for a living, and I was proud to do it, proud to be a part of a family business, proud to be a part of small-business America. As the world knows, the President grew up in a family business, too. We both, I can tell you, know the sacrifices that are required to make a family small business work -- the long hours, the hard work. And we both know this simple fact: When small business is strong, America is strong, and the American economy thrives. (Applause.)Thats why President Trump wants to help you become stronger than ever before. What he said on the campaign trail about strengthening small business is what were already doing in the White House. On day one, we went right to work on a plan to cut taxes for working families, small businesses and family farms. He signed legislation to roll back reams of red tape and regulation issued under the Obama administration. He instructed every agency and department in Washington, D.C., also to identify two regulations to get rid of before they issue another ream of red tape. Were rolling back taxes and were rolling back red tape already in Washington, D.C., thanks to you. (Applause.) The President also knows that the rule of law is the heart of a growing free-market economy and hes taken decisive action to end illegal immigration, strengthen our borders and uphold the immigration laws of America. (Applause.)And Im glad to say businesses are already reacting to President Trumps buy American and hire American vision with optimism, investment, and a belief in our country again. Have you noticed it? I mean, from GM, to U.S. Steel, to IBM, to so many other companies, theyre already announcing their intention to keep jobs here, to create news ones, tens of thousands of them. As Ford Motor Companys chief executive put it, even before the President took his oath of office, their investments are a vote of confidence in the agenda of President Donald Trump. (Applause.) So lets talk about that agenda. Let me say, if you take nothing else from what I tell you today, know this: The nightmare of Obamacare is about to end. (Applause.) Despite the best efforts of liberal activists at many town halls around the country, the American people know the truth: Obamacare has failed, and Obamacare must go. (Applause.) This failed law is crippling the American economy and crushing the American worker. We all know the broken promises of Obamacare; they're almost too many to count. They told you the cost of insurance would go down. They told you if you like your doctor, you can keep them. They told you your health plan -- you could keep that too. Well, none of it was true.Americans are now paying $3,000 more a year for health insurance on average. Last year alone, premiums skyrocketed by a stunning 25 percent, and millions of Americans have lost their plans and their doctors since the outset of the Affordable Care Act. Higher cost, fewer choices, worse care -- that's Obamacare. And that's got to end.Small businesses like those represented here today know exactly what I'm talking about. The last few years it's been harder to get ahead. Obamacare has only made it harder still -- if not impossible in some cases. One of the business leaders I just talked to talked about the weight of Obamacare on his nearly 700 employees, and the difficulty that it's placed on them and on their families. Obamacare is a job-killer and everybody in America knows it. And we're about to change all that. We're going to repeal Obamacare once and for all. Get rid of its mandates and its taxes and its intrusion on your lives and on your businesses. (Applause.)And best of all, at the same time we repeal Obamacare, Obamacare is going to be replaced with something that actually works, something that brings freedom and individual responsibility back to American healthcare. (Applause.)Now, President Trump and I want every American to have access to quality and affordable health insurance, which is why we're designing a better law. A market-driven law that reforms and improves how health care is provided in this country. We're working right now with leaders in Congress to lower the cost of health insurance by giving Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines the way you purchase life insurance and the way you purchase car insurance. (Applause.)We're working with Congress to make sure that Americans with preexisting conditions have health insurance and don't have any fear of losing that health insurance. And we're working with Congress to give states the flexibility -- Governor Greitens, where'd you go? We're working with Congress to make sure we give states and governors like your great governor the flexibility they need to care for the least fortunate and their healthcare needs the way it will work in Missouri and the way that will work in each individual state. (Applause.)Despite the scare tactics from the liberal left, the President and I are committed -- make it clear here -- we're committed to an orderly transition to a better healthcare system in America -- one that lowers the cost of health insurance, unleashes innovation, and puts the American people first. In all those concepts -- innovation, putting people first -- those are all the same principles that got Fabick Cat to 100 years. And it's what actually works in American business. And we truly do believe those free-market principles -- individual responsibility and a consumer choice -- can make the best healthcare system in America married to the best health insurance system in America, as well. (Applause.)If they can work for America's business, theyll work in American healthcare.But our agenda doesn't just stop there. I'll guarantee there isn't anyone here who can make sense of America's tax code, including me. (Laughter.) There's an old joke that says the tax code is about 10 times the size of the Bible but with none of the good news. (Laughter and applause.)It's a good line, but it's hardly a laughing matter. Truth is, our country's tax system these days penalizes success. It makes it far too hard for hardworking people and small businesses to achieve the American Dream. It takes too much money out of your pockets. It stifles job growth, wage growth, economic growth, and every other type of growth you need to get ahead.Now, rest assured, when President Trump and I get done, before we get to this summertime, we're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms -- and get this economy moving again. (Applause.)We want you to keep more of your hard-earned money, plain and simple. You know how to spend your paycheck better than any politician in Washington, D.C., ever could. By the same token, you also know how to run your businesses and your own lives better than any bureaucrat -- that's why, as I mentioned before, we're going to keep on working together, and President Trump and I are going to keep rolling back senseless regulations that are strangling businesses and stifling our country's potential.Everyone here knows the tremendous burden of red tape and regulation. Complying with these monstrous costs costs time and money to businesses that would be better spent hiring more good people and growing businesses and improving worker benefits. Our administration is working with Congress to repeal these job-killing, big-government regulations issued in the last administration in particular. We're going to rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded desks in Washington, D.C. (Applause.)And before I close, if you haven't noticed it yet, let me remind you that we actually all elected a builder as the 45th President of the United States. (Applause.) And under President Donald Trump, we're going to rebuild America. (Applause.) President Trump has called attention to our nation's crumbling infrastructure like no contemporary person in public life. Rest assured, we're going to work with the Congress to make historic investments in infrastructure so that we have the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways, and the best airports in the best nation on Earth. (Applause.)Every dollar we invest in infrastructure is a dollar we invest in America's future and in our prosperity. And when we do that, let's be clear: We're going to rebuild America, and we're going to hire American, and we're going to buy American when we rebuild this country. (Applause.) We're going to rebuild America with American workers and American tools. (Applause.)In fact, I'm pleased to announce President Trump has already taken action in this regard. Some of you may have noticed, just last month, after years of senseless delays, President Trump authorized the construction of the Keystone pipeline and the Dakota pipelines for our energy future and to create American jobs. (Applause.) That's what it means to rebuild our infrastructure and put America back to work.So, ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it. Our economy is going to grow faster than ever before and faster than you can imagine. We're already hearing from those who oppose these policies, though. People are out there opposing tax cuts, opposing slashing outdated regulations, opposing repealing Obamacare, and most of all, they seem to want to oppose the President's effort to give power back to the American people. We're hearing from these people every day, and the national media is more than willing to give them a platform each and every day.So all I ask of all of you here in Missouri is let America hear from you. (Applause.)In the days ahead, I promise you, President Trump and I are going to work with the Congress and we're going to drive forward our best efforts to turn this country around, create good-paying jobs at home, and a safer and more prosperous America. But America needs to hear from small business, from hardworking Americans who work in small business. The people who know we can do better. The people who know we can be more prosperous and know we can get this economy working for every American again.So let your voice be heard. Talk to a neighbor over a backyard fence. Stop somebody at the grocery store. Get online, on Facebook, send an email to a friend. But just send them a note and say, I ran into Mike the other day -- (laughter) -- they're doing exactly what they said they were going to do, and I believe it works. And we need to support this President and this administration. That's what you've got to tell them. (Applause.)So thanks for coming out on this sunny day in February. (Laughter.) As my friend and our President likes to say, with boundless faith in the American people and faith in God who has ever watched over this land -- (applause) -- we will make America safe again. We will make America prosperous again. And with your help, and with God's help, and with this great new President, we will make America great again.Let's go get it done. Thank you. God bless you, Missouri. (Applause.)END3:08 P.M. EST",20775.6,32.599999999998545,5860.63,-5.319999999999709,2362.82,-2.5599999999999454
197,2017-02-23,Remarks by President Trump in Meeting with Manufacturing CEOs,"State Dining Room10:57 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. It's a great honor to have everybody. And some of the great people in the world of business, many of you I know -- many of you I know from reading all of our wonderful magazines and business magazines, in particular. So it's an honor to have you with us today.Bringing manufacturing back to America, creating high-wage jobs was one of our campaign promises and themes, and it resonated with everybody. It was really something what happened. States that hadnt been won in many, many years were -- they came over to our fold. A lot of it had to do with the jobs, and other reasons -- but jobs. And I'm delivering on everything that we've said. In fact, people are saying they've never seen so much happen in 30 days of a presidency. We've delivered on a lot. And I think Mark can explain, and Mark can probably say some of the things we're doing for the auto industry. We're going to be doing for many of the industries.As you know, the United States lost one-third of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. That's an unbelievable number and statistic. And 70,000 factories closed since China joined the WTO -- 70,000 factories. So when I used to give that statistic, I used to talk about and I always thought it was a typo. I said, it has to be a typo. I tell Wilbur -- Wilbur, that can't be right -- 70,000. Think of it, 70,000 factories. So you say, what are we doing? My administration's policies and regulatory reform, tax reform, trade policies will return significant manufacturing jobs to our country. Everything is going to be based on bringing our jobs back, the good jobs, the real jobs. They've left, and they're coming back. They have to come back.You've already seen companies such as Intel, Ford. Mark has been great. GM, Walmart, Amgen, Amazon, Fiat -- they came the other day; they're going to make a tremendous investment in the country. Carrier and many others announced significant new investments in the United States. For example, Ford is doing 700 million in Michigan, creating 700 new jobs -- is a vote of confidence. It was actually stated a vote of confidence. We have many other companies doing the same thing. Carrier, as you know -- and I got involved very late, almost like by two years late -- but many of the jobs that were leaving for Mexico, they're bringing back at least 800 jobs they're bringing back. And they actually never got to leave. I have no idea what they did with the plant in Mexico, but we'll have to ask them, because it was largely built.General Motors is investing $1 billion in U.S. plants, adding or keeping 7,000 jobs. And it's going to be investing a lot more than that over the next fairly short period. Lockheed Martin has -- they've just announced 1,800 new jobs, and U.S. plants are doing a great job, and we started negotiating with them a little bit on the F-35. They cut their price a little bit. Thank you very much. She's tough. (Laughter.) But it worked out well I think for everybody. And I think I have to say this: Marillyn, you've gotten a lot of credit, because what you did was the right thing. So we appreciate it. She cut her price over $700 million, right? By over $700 million. You think Hillary would have asked for $700 million? (Laughter.) Oh, boy, I hope you -- I assume you wanted her to win. But you know what? You're going to do great and you're going to make more planes. It's going to work out the same, or better.Walmart announced plans to create 10,000 jobs, and all of those jobs are going to be in the United States. Sprint and SoftBank is putting in $50 billion because of our election in the United States, over the next four years, to create 50,000 jobs. They've been terrific, by the way. And we have many others. Many of you are in the room, and you know exactly what I'm talking about. We have many, many other companies. And we're very happy.Today we have 24 CEOs from the largest manufacturing companies in the country and even in the world. They represent people just in this room, nearly $1 trillion of sales and 2 million employees, large majorities of which are in the United States. They share our commitment to bringing manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country, which has been the biggest part of my campaign. I would say the border, a big part. Military strength, big part. And jobs, big part. I dont want to say which is most important. I guess we always have to say defense is maybe the most important. But many of you take care of our defense, you make great products. Nobody makes the products that we do for our military. Nobody. And, in fact, a couple of countries who were not allowed to buy from us, I gave them -- hello, Jeff -- I gave them authorization -- you can only buy from us. I want them to buy from us. They were getting planes from other countries because our -- and theyre allies. But theyre going to be buying from us from now on.And I just want to thank all of my people. My staff has been amazing. Gary, as you know -- you all know Gary from Goldman, Gary Cohn. And were really happy -- just paid $200 million in tax in order to take this job, by the way. (Laughter.) Which is very much unlike Gary. But hes great. And hell be criticized by the media because hes getting paid $197,000. Theyll say he really wanted that money -- which he gave up. I think he gave up -- did you give that up, Gary? I think so.MR. COHN: Yes.PARTICIPANT: It was one of those things.THE PRESIDENT: It was one of those things. Thats right. (Laughter.) I want to thank -- Wilbur has been so fantastic. Ive known Wilbur for so long, and hes a great guy, great negotiator, but a very fair negotiator. And hes going to be doing things that -- the deals we have with other countries are unbelievably bad. We dont have any good deals. In fact, Im trying to find a country where we actually have a surplus of trade as opposed to -- everything is a deficit.With Mexico, we have $70 billion in deficits, trade deficits, and its unsustainable. Were not going to let it happen. Cant let it happen. Were going to have a good relationship with Mexico, I hope. And if we dont, we dont. But we cant let that happen -- $70 billion in trade deficits. And that doesnt include the drugs that pour across the border, like water. So we cant let that happen.With China, we have close to a $500-billion trade deficit. So we have to do something. I spoke to the President, I spoke to many people. Were going to work on that very, very hard, and were going to do things that are the proper things to do. But I actually said to my people: Find a country where we actually do well. So far, we havent found that country. Its just losses with everybody, and were going to turn that around.I want to thank Jared Kushner, who has been so involved in this, and all of my guys.  We have a great team. We have a team of all-stars. And weve been credit -- weve really been given credit for that. Right now, Rex, who, as you know, hes in Mexico -- I said, thats going to be a tough trip, because we have to be treated fairly by Mexico. Thats going to be a tough trip. But hes over there with General Kelly, whos been unbelievable at the border. You see whats happening at the border. All of a sudden for the first time were getting gang members out, were getting drug lords out. Were getting really bad dudes out of this country and at a rate that nobody has ever seen before. And theyre the bad ones.And its a military operation because what has been allowed to come into our country -- when you see gang violence that youve read about like never before and all of the things -- much of that is people that are here illegally. And theyre rough and theyre tough, but theyre not tough like our people. So were getting them out.I thought what we could do is maybe well start with Ken on my left, and well go around the room and introduce yourselves to the press. Lots of media. One thing, we have lots of media. How are you? Treats me -- thats one that treats me very nicely, one of the few. Hi. And well just start around -- go around the room and then well talk privately without the press, and were going to figure out how to bring many, many millions of jobs more back to the United States, okay?Ken, go ahead.MR. FRAZIER: Thank you, Mr. President, its good to be here. Ken Frazier from Merck & Co., Inc.MR. FIELDS: Thank you, Mr. President. Mark Fields, CEO of Ford Motor Company.MS. MORRISON: Thank you, Mr. President. Denise Morrison from Campbell Soup Company.THE PRESIDENT: Good soup.MS. MORRISON: Thank you.MR. HAYES: Thank you, Mr. President. Greg Hayes from United Technologies, the parent company of Carrier.THE PRESIDENT: Did you bring any more of those jobs back from Carrier? (Laughter.) But one thing he did -- you know, I told -- I said, you were given so much credit for that, and I heard, two days ago, that youre selling far more Carrier air conditioners than you thought, just as a patriotic move. People are buying Carrier because of what you did -- bringing the jobs back to Indiana.MR. HAYES: Thats exactly right. Its a great success.THE PRESIDENT: Right? So, I said that. I thought that was going to happen. Good. Thank you.MR. STYSLINGER: Thank you, Mr. President. Lee Styslinger with Altec, Inc.MR. GORSKY: Thank you, Mr. President.

OBERHELMAN: Were doing a D11, and we have some of those around as well.THE PRESIDENT: Because the D12, Im waiting for, you know. Thats going to be bigger than anything ever in history, right? But theres nothing like what you do. The Caterpillars are the best.MR. OBERHELMAN: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: And when we raise the dollar, and we let other people manipulate their currencies, its the one thing that stops you, Doug -- right?MR. OBERHELMAN: Well, well take them on. Bring them on.THE PRESIDENT: Right, technology. No, but we have to give you a level playing field.MR. OBERHELMAN: We need a level playing field.THE PRESIDENT: We have to let other countries give you a level playing field. So, what a great company. I love Caterpillar. Ive been driving them for a long time.MR. OBERHELMAN: Well, come out and see us, and well put you in one. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: Okay, good. I might do that soon. Go ahead.MR.

Thank you for the opportunity.THE PRESIDENT: And youre going to be doing pipelines now. You know that, right? We put you heavy into the pipeline business because we approved, as you know, the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota. But they have to buy -- meaning, steel, so Ill say U.S. Steel -- but steel made in this country and pipelines made in this country.MR. LONGHI: 100 percent, Mr. President. Well be there.THE PRESIDENT: So the pipe is coming from the U.S. MR. LONGHI: By the way, when you come drive trucks, come up to Minnesota and our mines.

Lot 10, we call it. Lot 10 -- 90 planes. It was 90 planes out of 3,000, but it was not doing so well, and now its doing great. Right?MS. HEWSON: Thats right, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Okay, good.MS. HEWSON: And we welcome you to Fort Worth to see those aircraft on the production line.THE PRESIDENT: Good. Very good.

Look forward to really working you on creating more manufacturing jobs.THE PRESIDENT: Jeff actually watched me make a hole-in-one, can you believe that? Should you tell that story?MR. IMMELT: We were trying to talk President Trump into doing ""The Apprentice."" That was my assignment when we owned NBC. President Trump goes up to a par 3 on his course, he looks to the three of us and says, You realize of course Im the richest golfer in the world. Thats a comment, then gets a hole-in-one. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: Crazy.MR. IMMELT: I have to say, you know, Ive seen the magic before. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: Its so crazy that -- no, I actually said I was the best golfer of all the rich people -- (laughter) -- to be exact. And then I got a hole-in-one.MR.

200,2017-02-23,Remarks by President Trump at Listening Session on Domestic and International Human Trafficking,"Roosevelt Room2:40 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, everybody, very nice. Nice to see you. Well, I want to thank Dina and Ivanka and everybody for working so hard to set this up. It's been so important to them, and I want to make it clear today that my administration will focus on ending the absolutely horrific practice of human trafficking. And I am prepared to bring the full force and weight of our government to the federal and at the federal level, and the other highest levels, whatever we can do, in order to solve this horrific problem. It's getting worse and it's happening in the United States in addition to the rest of the world, but it's happening in the United States, which is terrible. Human trafficking is a dire problem, both domestically and internationally, and is one that's made really a challenge. And it's really made possible to a large extent, more of a modern phenomenon, by what's taking place on the Internet, as you probably know. Solving the human trafficking epidemic, which is what it is, is a priority for my administration. We're going to help out a lot. ""Solve"" is a wonderful word, a beautiful word, but I can tell you, we're going to help a lot. I'll direct the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies that have a role in preventing human trafficking to take a hard look at the resources and personnel that they're currently devoting to this fight. Now, they are devoting a lot, but we're going to be devoting more.Dedicated men and women across the federal government have focused on this for some time, as you know. A lot of you have been dealing with the federal government and it's been much more focused over the last four weeks -- I can tell you that. I cannot thank each of you enough, and the dedicated men and women who run my staff and your staffs in getting everybody together was terrific. I was so glad I was able to be here. You start with really a tremendous amount of energy and blood, sweat and tears. Government can be helpful, but without you, nothing would happen. So, again, I want to thank everybody in this room. It's a very, very terrible problem. It's not talked about enough. People don't know enough about it. And we're going to talk about it, and we're going to bring it out into the open and hopefully we're going to do a great deal to help prevent some of the horrific -- really horrific -- crimes that are taking place.And I can see -- I really can say, in this country, people don't realize how bad it is in this country, but in this country and all over the world. So thank you all for being here.Thank you very much.END2:44 P.M. EST",20810.32,34.720000000001164,5835.51,-25.11999999999989,2363.81,0.9899999999997817
201,2017-02-23,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/23/2017, #15","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room2:58 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: I was thinking about not doing a briefing today, and then I saw Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon give that talk and I thought they were infringing on my ratings, so we figured we had to do something to keep up our record.Its been another busy day today. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President welcomed some of the worlds top business and manufacturing leaders to the White House to continue the administrations effort to engage with the private sector to create jobs and expand opportunities for Americas workers. The 24 CEOs spent the morning in working sessions with the Vice President, Cabinet members and key aides, and came together with the President to brief him on their discussions and recommendations.The group discussed the need to roll back burdensome regulations that are stifling economic growth. The CEOs thanked the President for the actions that hes already taken to address the issues, and the President pledged to do even more, both through the executive branch and by working with Congress to pass legislation that will help further economic growth and job creation.The business leaders recommended that the administration take a multifaceted approach to tax and trade policies, including tax reform, toward which Secretary Mnuchin said that progress is continuing to be made. The President committed to working to lower taxes and level the playing field with other countries when it comes to trade and taxation.The group held a lengthy discussion about the need to invest in the American worker to prepare for the manufacturing jobs of the future, especially the key role of vocational schools in training the workforce of the 21st century. The CEOs and administration officials agreed that public-private partnerships will be the cornerstone of a robust plan to rebuild the nations crumbling infrastructure. The President committed to streamlining a permitting process that is holding back so many key projects. At the end of the discussion, the group expressed their excitement for having a true partner in economic growth in the White House, and Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical, even said that this is probably the most pro-business administration since the Founding Fathers. The President conveyed his intention to assemble the industry leaders on a regular basis to discuss progress towards these important goals. A full list of the participants is available.This afternoon, the President spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau by phone. Well have a readout on that call soon. Right now, many of you just came from the President, who is involved in another listening session with leaders in the fight against domestic and international human trafficking, including representatives from International Justice Mission and United Way. Their expertise will be invaluable to the President as he engages with members of Congress to raise awareness about, and push through, legislation aimed at preventing all forms of the horrific and unacceptable practice of the buying and selling of human lives.Human trafficking is a dire problem, both domestically and internationally. And solving this epidemic is a huge priority for the President. Dedicated men and women from across the federal government have focused on this for some time, and the President is committed to continue working with these organizations and departments. A participant list for this listening session is also going to be available.The President this evening will attend a dinner with the Business Council. Today in Mexico, Secretaries Tillerson and Kelly had productive meetings at the Cabinet level with officials from the Mexican government. They were forward-looking meetings focused on finding common-ground ways to advance both of our countries security and economic wellbeing. Both sides had a candid discussion on the breadth of challenges and opportunities as part of the U.S.-Mexico relationship.The conversation covered a full range of bilateral issues, including energy, legal migration, security, education exchanges, and people-to-people ties. The parties also reiterated our joint commitment to maintaining law and order at our shared border by stopping potential terrorists and dismantling the transnational criminal networks that are moving drugs and people into the United States.Under this President there is no mistaking that rule of law matters along both sides of our border. Both Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly are meeting with President Pea Nieto this afternoon. That will be a continuation of the productive dialogue that is setting our two countries down a pathway to greater security and long-term prosperity.Looking ahead to our upcoming schedule, tomorrow the President will welcome President of Peru for a working-level visit. The President of Peru is in town for a separate visit and requested a meeting with the President. There will be a spray at the top of that. Further guidance will be provided later today. The President will also speak at CPAC tomorrow. I know the President is looking forward to addressing this group of conservative-committed individuals.Our nations governors are starting to gather in Washington this week for a meeting of the National Governors Association. The President and the First Lady will welcome the governors to the White House on Sunday evening. The Vice President and members of the Cabinet will also be in attendance. While the governors are in town, they will be meeting with members of the Cabinet, White House staff, and other Secretaries including Kelly, Price, and Secretary Chao have also set up a series of meetings. The President, Vice President, and senior White House staff will also participate in a portion of the business session of NGAs winter meeting that takes place on Monday morning.Next week, of course, the President will give a joint session address before both Houses of Congress. Hes currently working closely with the speechwriting team on presenting his vision to Congress and the American people. Ive got a few updates that I want to just -- as were now a few days out. The theme of the address will be the renewal of the American spirit. The address will particularly focus on public safety, including defense, increased border security, taking care of our veterans, and then economic opportunity, including education, job training, healthcare reform, jobs, and tax and regulatory reform.With that, Id be glad to take a few of your questions. Q  Two questions. First, the White House said previously that that travel ban was pushed quickly out of necessity for national security, and now were hearing theres these repeated delays while the new one is being drafted. How do we reconcile those two talking points? Thats question one.And then secondly, the President said today that the deportations taking place under his watch are a military operation. Secretary Kelly said the military wont be involved in deportations. Did the President misspeak?MR. SPICER: So Ill take the latter first. The President was using that as an adjective. Its happening with precision, and in a manner in which its being done very, very clearly. I think weve made it clear in the past, and Secretary Kelly reiterated it, what kind of operation this was. But the President was clearly describing the manner in which this was being done. And so just to be clear on his use of that phrase. And I think the way its being done, by all accounts, is being done with very much a high degree of precision and a flawless manner in terms of making sure that the orders are carried out, and its done in a very streamlined and efficient manner.Im sorry, the first part was?Q  The first one was about the travel ban.MR. SPICER: Yeah. And I think, look, we have made it very clear that we believe that the first one was done in compliance with U.S. code and the authority granted to the President. This time, the order is finalized. What we are doing is now in the implementation phase of working with the respective departments and agencies to make sure that when we execute this, its done in a manner thats flawless.And so its not a question of delaying, its a question of getting it right. Weve taken the Courts opinions and concerns into consideration, but the order is finalized. Its now awaiting implementation. What we want to do is make sure that were working through the departments and agencies so that any concerns or questions are handled on the front end. But we are acting with appropriate haste and diligence to make sure that the order is done in an appropriate manner.Q  I want to ask you about a comment that the Treasury Secretary made today. He was asked if we should assume that the tax plan that the President is about to roll out will take effect in 2018. He said, and Im quoting, I think were looking at that. So my question to you is, would the President accept a tax proposal that deals with the timeline of implementation in 2018 but not 2017?MR. SPICER: So, Secretary Mnuchin also made it very clear that his goal is to have this wrapped up by August and implemented. The question is, or what youre referring to is what year it actually takes place?Q  Right.MR. SPICER: Right, so whether its retroactive to tax year 2017 or fiscal year '17. And I think as the details get --Q  (Inaudible.)MR. SPICER: Yeah, well have more details on that as it moves forward. I think theres two issues -- fiscal year '17 and calendar year '17. And, for taxpayers, its obviously calendar year 2017 that theyre probably most concerned with, and I think the President, as we work with Congress, will have those details to be able to flush out.I want to go to our first Skype seat of the day. Neil Vigdor with Hearst Connecticut Media Group.Q  Good afternoon, Sean. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. Connecticuts governor directed police chiefs across the state Wednesday to avoid taking any special action against undocumented immigrants, including honoring immigration detainer requests from ICE. What will the repercussions be for this state in terms of federal funding it receives from the Trump administration?And secondly, does the Presidents executive order on sanctuary cities apply to those that are undeclared sanctuary cities?MR. SPICER: Well, Neil, I think theres a couple things. The idea that Governor Malloy would not want the law followed as enacted by Congress or by the Connecticut legislature in any fashion seems to be concerning, right? Whether youre a governor or mayor or the President, laws are passed in this country and we expect people and our lawmakers and our law enforcement agencies to follow and adhere to the laws as passed by the appropriate level of government.So its obviously concerning, I think, and its troubling that thats the message that he would send to his people and to other governors. Because we are a nation of laws, and I think that people need to understand that whether its the laws that he passes as the Governor of Connecticut or the laws that are passed through Congress and signed by the President, theres a reason that our democracy works. Its because the people speak, our representatives at every level pass a law, and the executive in that particular branch of government signs or vetoes it, and then we live by those rules. And the idea that you can decide which laws to agree or not to agree with, or follow or not follow, undermines our entire rule of law.And so I would suggest that that is not a great sign to be sending to the people of Connecticut and the people of this country, that a particular governor chooses not to follow the duly-passed laws of this nation. With respect to sanctuary cities, I think this is an area that the American people by huge amounts support. They recognize their tax dollars shouldnt be spent supporting programs and activities to which people are not entitled to. And so I think the President has been very clear on this -- that if you are a sanctuary city, declared or undeclared, if you are providing benefits or services, we are going to do everything we can to respect taxpayers and ensure that your states follow the law.April.Q  Sean, on the bathroom issue, there was a different comment from the President about, you know, if people like Caitlyn Jenner wanted to use this bathroom in Trump Tower, she could now. Whats happened?MR. SPICER: No, I think thats -- so just to be clear, the President was asked -- at one point Caitlyn Jenner was in Trump Tower, and he said, thats great. Thats consistent with everything hes said. Its a states' rights issue. And thats entirely what he believes -- that if a state wants to pass a law or rule, or an organization wants to do something in compliance with the state rule, thats their right. But it shouldnt be the federal government getting in the way of this. I mean, if you look at this, the law that was passed in 1972 did not contemplate or consider this issue. Number two, the procedure for this guidance letter that was done through the Obama administration was not properly followed. There was no comment period. There was no input from parents, teachers, students or administrators. None. So if we think about how this was implemented last administration, there was zero input, there was zero comment period offered. Teachers and students never had any say in how this was implemented. Number three, theres a reason that the Texas court had this matter enjoined. Its because it didnt follow the law and it had procedural problems.Four, as I mentioned, its a states' rights issue. And then five is, I think that we do have to recognize that children do enjoy rights, from anti-bullying statutes that are in almost every state, and that theres a difference between being compassionate for individuals and children who are struggling with something and wanting to make sure theyre protected, and how its being done. And I think that the President has a big heart, as weve talked about in a lot of other issues, and theres a big difference. Personally, he addressed this issue when it came up with respect to one of his properties.But he also believes that thats not a federal government issue. Its an issue left to the states, and its an issue that -- I mean, theres a reason in August of last year that the court enjoined this, because it hadnt followed the law and it hadnt -- the procedure, the comment period and the solicitation of opinions and ideas wasnt followed. It was jammed down the process.And so were actually following the law on this one, and I think thats the way its supposed to be done.John.Q  If I could just follow on what April said. The Human Rights Campaign --Q  I wasnt finished, Im sorry. Q  Well, Im following on your question. Let me follow --Q  I understand that, but --MR. SPICER: Why dont we let April follow on and then well get to John, Kristen and Brian.Q  Yeah. So I have one on -- I have something on another issue really fast, then John can do that. On the HBCU executive order, we understand the executive order thats coming out sometime later this month, its supposed to open -- youre working out issues of opening an office specifically to take the HBCU initiative out of the Department of Education and bring it directly under the purview of the White House. Who will be heading that? Have you figured that out? Have you also figured out how you will build that office out? Because from what I understand, that is one of the big pieces of this.MR. SPICER: Well, respectfully, thats why it hasnt been issued yet. Were working it through the process. Obviously, that is something that were committed to getting done by the end of Black History Month. So our days are numbered, but theres a commitment by the President and the staff to really focus on this issue and give it the proper respect that it deserves. So if youll bear with us a couple more days, I promise you well have more to say on that.Q  So it will be a department with the full --MR. SPICER: No, no, I just want to be clear, Im not going to get into the details. Sort of my blanket statement on non-issued executive orders. But I do know that there is a commitment by the President and the staff that he has been very clear with us that he wants that done by the end of this month for obvious reasons.Now John.Q  Let me get back to where we were. The Human Rights Campaign, in responding to rescinding the guidance last night, said that this is not a states' rights issue, its a civil rights issue, and therefore is in the purview of the federal government. Do you disagree that this a civil rights issue?MR. SPICER: Its not a -- its a question of where its appropriately addressed. And I think theres a reason -- like, weve got to remember, this guidance was enjoined last August by a court. It hasnt been enforced. There was no comment period by anyone -- by the Human Rights Campaign, by teachers, parents, students. Nobody had any input of this.And it seems to me a little interesting that if this was any other issue, people would be crying foul that the process wasnt followed. The reality is, is that when you look at Title IX, it was enacted in 1972. The idea that this was even contemplated at that is preposterous on its face. But that doesnt mean that the President -- the President obviously understands the issue and the challenges that especially young children face. He just believes that this is a state issue that needs to be addressed by states, as he does with a lot of other issues that weve talked about.And so this is -- we are a states' rights party. The President on a lot of issues believes in these various issues being states' rights. I dont see why this would be any different. And again, if you go through it, its not just -- its how the guidance was issued, its the legal basis on which it was ordered. It fell short on a lot of stuff.It wasnt us that did this; it was the court that stepped in and said that they hadnt followed the procedure of the law back in August of last year and enjoin the case.Q  I understand all that, Im just wondering if -- does the White House disagree with the position that this is a civil right?MR. SPICER: Well, I think its not a question of whether its a civil right, its where is it appropriately addressed. And as I noted, its appropriately addressed at the state level.Kelly.Q  Can I follow on that? Sean, does the President believe, personally believe that any student who is transgender should be able to use the bathroom of their choice? His personal belief?MR. SPICER: The President believes its a states' rights issue. And hes not going to get into determining -- I understand what youre asking, Kelly. And I think that, as April pointed out, when the issue came to one of his own properties he was very clear. But again, what he doesnt want to do is force his issues or beliefs down -- he believes its a states' rights issue --Q  But the public may want to know where the President is on this issue.MR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think that he is very sympathetic to children who deal with that and that this is up to states and schools within a particular district to address how they want to accommodate that, and not sort of be prescriptive from Washington. Thats what the President believes.Zeke.Q  Thanks, Sean. You mentioned that this order was enjoined by a court and there was criticism about the process. That exact same criticism has been levied on the administrations first executive order, on the travel ban. I mean, can you help us square the circle here? Why are you relying on that same enjoined by a federal court criticism of the process for one but not the other?MR. SPICER: Well, I think theres a big difference. Theres no way that you can read Title IX from 1972 -- anybody -- and say that that was even contemplated back then. It just -- theres nobody that is possibly suggesting that the law that was passed in 1972 did that.Number two, there was zero comment period put forward on this guidance, which is in violation of how it was executed, okay? And so theres a big difference -- hold on, hold, on let me answer the question, Zeke. There is also a strong reading when you read 1182 U.S. Code that it is very clear that the President does have the authority.So they are very much apples and oranges issue. One, its very clear that the President is told by Congress in U.S. code that he has the authority to do whats necessary to protect the American people. And theres no way that anybody above a fifth grade reading level could interpret that different. There is a difference between looking at a statute from 1972 and saying that something was complicated back then. Not only that -- again, its a multifaceted thing. When you look at how the guidance was issued, there was a zero comment period. Nobody was able to weigh in on that situation back then. And so when youre talking about forcing schools to make a huge accommodation from the federal level, and schools, parents, teachers, kids were not able to have any input in that decision from Washington, I think its a very, very clear difference. John Gizzi. Q  Thank you, Sean. Just going back two weeks, in a story that got relatively little attention at the time -- Chuck Cooper, a very distinguished lawyer, asked that his name be withdrawn when he was on the periphery of being named U.S. Solicitor General. So my question is a two-parter. First, can you confirm or deny the administration is now vetting Mr. Miguel Estrada, who was a former nominee for the Court of Appeals, as Solicitor General before the visa delay case gets to the Supreme Court?And second, Mr. Cooper said that he did not want to go through the same experience that Jeff Sessions, his good friend, did when he had the confirmation hearings and the vote in the Senate. Does that make the President a little bit discouraged about getting the nominees he wants for some very important positions?MR. SPICER: Well, thanks, John. And Id say - on the first part, as you know -- and Ill give you the same answer we give executive orders -- we dont comment on personnel decisions until theyre made, until theyre finalized. So Ive got nothing for that.On the second part, what I would say is that the President is very confident we have a deep bench of folks who -- during the transition, we talked about this -- a number of people who have expressed a huge interest in joining the President in fulfilling this agenda. And that list is robust and long.However, that being said, I think for folks who have to go through the Senate confirmation and to watch what has happened to some of these fine individuals -- the delay tactics, the tearing apart of their personal lives -- it is discouraging for some of these people, I think, in terms of Mr. Cooper and others who are looking at the process saying, I would like to be part of this administration, help fulfill this vision and this agenda, but this is what Im going to have go through.So while this is somewhat of an isolated case, I definitely understand what hes talking about here. And I think those are few and far between, but I think that when you realize what is happening largely at the expense of Senate Democrats, in terms of dragging these people through a very, very delayed and arduous process for purely political points, I think that there are some people who could look at the process and potentially say I don't want to serve.Luckily, we've not come to that beyond a handful of folks. Largely, people have huge desire and are willing to make great sacrifice -- both financially and personally -- to serve in the administration because I think they understand what potential change this President is bringing to this country and to the city. But I understand his point.Q  This morning, the President talked about, as he often does when he talks about immigrants, he talks about really bad dudes. MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q  You talked about precision. The Homeland Security Secretary this morning insisted there wont be mass deportation.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  Is it the Presidents intent or desire, as some advocates worry, that people who are here illegally with something as simple as a traffic violation, that those people will be subject to deportation? Yes or no?MR. SPICER: Well, I think everybody who is in this country for obvious reasons -- if you overstay a visa, if you commit a crime, you can't -- by the very nature of you not being legal, you can be subject to deportation. That's by definition. Being in this country is a privilege, not a right, if you are a visitor. And I think we have a right to make sure that the people who are in this country are here for good and peaceful processes. And as Ive said over and over again, there is a big difference. The President recognizes that there are millions of people in the country who are not here legally, and that we have to have a very systematic and pragmatic and methodical process of going through those individuals to make sure that the people who pose a threat to public safety or have a criminal record are the first that are gone.What we've done -- just to be clear -- is to untie the hands of ICE and Border Patrol agents and say, your job is to enforce the law -- first and foremost to figure out who poses a threat to us. But in the previous administration their hands had been tied. There was exception after exception after exception. And the fact of the matter is, is that we have to -- we are a nation of laws, and we have to have a system of legal immigration that is respected.So Im not going to be prescriptive in terms of what ICEs job is. But needless to say, their job and their mission is to protect the country and to enforce our borders and our immigration laws. And the President has basically instructed them to carry out their mission. And so the priorities, as we've discussed over and over and over again, is to do that is in accordance with the law but also prioritizes those people that pose a threat.Im going to go to Roby Brock from the Talk Business & Politics in -- where is he from? Arkansas. Q  Thanks, Sean. Roby Brock with Talk Business & Politics here in Arkansas, the home of the rowdiest town halls in the nation. I have a question on medical marijuana. Our state voters passed a medical marijuana amendment in November. Now we're in conflict with federal law, as many other states are. The Obama administration kind of chose not to strictly enforce those federal marijuana laws. My question to you is: With Jeff Sessions over at the Department of Justice as AG, whats going to be the Trump administrations position on marijuana legalization where its in a state-federal conflict like this?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Roby. Theres two distinct issues here: medical marijuana and recreational marijuana. I think medical marijuana, Ive said before that the President understands the pain and suffering that many people go through who are facing especially terminal diseases and the comfort that some of these drugs, including medical marijuana, can bring to them. And that's one that Congress, through a rider in 2011 -- looking for a little help -- I think put in an appropriations bill saying the Department of Justice wouldnt be funded to go after those folks. There is a big difference between that and recreational marijuana. And I think that when you see something like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many states around this country, the last thing that we should be doing is encouraging people. There is still a federal law that we need to abide by in terms of the medical -- when it comes to recreational marijuana and other drugs of that nature. So I think theres a big difference between medical marijuana, which states have a -- the states where its allowed, in accordance with the appropriations rider, have set forth a process to administer and regulate that usage, versus recreational marijuana. Thats a very, very different subject.Shannon.Q  What does that mean in terms of policy? A follow-up, Sean. What does that mean in terms of policy?MR. SPICER: Shannon. Glenn, this isnt a TV program. Were going to --Q  What is the Justice Department going to do?MR. SPICER: Okay, you dont get to just yell out questions. Were going to raise our hands like big boys and girls.Q  Why dont you answer the question, though?MR. SPICER: Because its not your job to just yell out questions. Shannon, please go.Q  Okay. Well, first, on the manufacturing summit, was the AFL-CIO invited? And then, yeah, I did want to follow up on this medical marijuana question. So is the federal government then going to take some sort of action around this recreational marijuana in some of these states?MR. SPICER: Well, I think thats a question for the Department of Justice. I do believe that youll see greater enforcement of it. Because again, theres a big difference between the medical use which Congress has, through an appropriations rider in 2014, made very clear what their intent was in terms of how the Department of Justice would handle that issue. Thats very different than the recreational use, which is something the Department of Justice I think will be further looking into. Im sorry, Shannon, what was the first part?Q  Was the AFL-CIO invited to the manufacturing meeting today with the CFOs? Because they are part of this manufacturing --MR. SPICER: Right. I think this was just focused on people who actually -- they were not, I dont believe, part of this one. As you know, that weve had union representation at other meetings. I think this was specifically for people who are hiring people and the impediments that theyre having to create additional jobs, hire more people. And obviously, while the President values their opinion -- and thats why theyve been involved in some of the past -- this was specifically a manufacturing -- people who hire people, who manufacture, who grow the economy, who grow jobs. And that is a vastly different situation.Andrei.Q  I specifically sat here next to John to have --MR. SPICER: One can see --Q  You know me. (Laughter.) Thank you. A question on Russia. Secretary Tillerson and General Dunford have had meetings with their Russian counterparts. Is the President pleased with the results of the meetings?MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  And what comes next?MR. SPICER: Yeah, both of them had an opportunity to meet with their counterparts in different locations, ironically on the same day. I believe that was yesterday. And they both had very, very productive discussions. The President was very pleased with the outcome of that, and so I would refer you back to both General Dunford and Secretary Tillerson on those. Q  You started discussing the where and when for the summit for the leaders meeting?MR. SPICER: I dont have any updates on that, but Ill look into that. Cecilia.Q  Sean, I just want to follow up. I want to clarify, make sure I understand what you said. You said, you will see greater enforcement of it?MR. SPICER: I would refer you to the Department of Justice --Q  But you said, you said there will be greater enforcement.MR. SPICER: No, no. I know. I know what I -- I think -- then thats what I said. But I think the Department of Justice is the lead on that. It is something that you should follow up with them, but I believe that they are going to continue to enforce the laws on the books with respect to recreational marijuana versus --Q  Okay. And my real question if you dont mind.MR. SPICER: That first one was pretty real.Q  Ivanka Trump was in the White House today for a meeting on human trafficking. She had this meeting on CEOs. We saw her in a smaller session here at the White House today. What exactly is her role here?MR. SPICER: I think her role is to be helpful and provide input on a variety of areas that she has deep, passionate concerns about, especially in the area of women in the workforce and empowering women. She is someone who has a lot of expertise and wants to offer that, especially in the area of trying to help women. She understands that firsthand. And I think because of the success that shes had, her goal is to try to figure out -- and the understanding that she has a businesswoman -- to use her expertise and understanding to empower and help women have the same kind of opportunity and success that shes had. So --Q  But still not a formal role?MR. SPICER: No, nothing more than youve seen now. I think, last night, the meeting that she had in Baltimore was one that was done on her own. Theres areas that shes cared very passionately about before her time in the White House, or before her father coming to the White House, rather. And now that her father is in the White House, she continues to seek a platform that helps empower and lift up women, and give them opportunities and think of ways that they can be --Q  Sean, thanks. On the human trafficking meeting today, the President said, well, when you talk about solving this kind of problem, thats a nice word, but its really -- he suggested that, more likely, he could just help out on that problem. Whats his definition of success in this? Whats his goal? Is he looking at stronger criminal penalties?MR. SPICER: Well, Dave, I think thats, as I read out earlier, that the President understands that this is a serious problem both for adults, but particularly for children who are being sold both domestically and internationally, and its why we brought these groups in. Its to make sure that we figure out how do we make that number as close to zero as possible and that we institute policies both domestically, but then abroad, and working with our partners to figure out how do we combat the trafficking of people. So its things that we can be forceful in terms of the rhetoric that the President uses, but also the enforcement tools that he uses both domestically and internationally.Trey.Q  Thanks, Sean. Has the President been briefed at all on the situation at Standing Rock? And is he concerned that a stand-off with protesters could slow down his executive orders on pipelines?MR. SPICER: Our team has been involved with both the tribe and the governor there, and so we are not only -- we are constantly in touch with them. And I think we feel very confident that we will move forward to get the pipeline moving. And so well have a further update on that, but I think we're in constant contact with the officials there.Kristen.Q  Sean, thank you. Two topics Id like to ask, but I wanted to start off by following on the transgender directive. Eight-two percent of transgender children report feeling unsafe at school. So isnt the President leaving some of these children open to vulnerable -- to being bullied at school?MR. SPICER: No. I mean, there are bullying laws and policies in place in almost every one of these schools.Q  Transgender children say their experience is --MR. SPICER: But I don't think -- hold on --Q  -- not being able to use the bathroom that they feel comfortable using because of vulnerability to bullying.MR. SPICER: But again, you're missing the point here, Kristen. The President said literally it should be a state decision. He respects the decision of the state. So therefore --Q  So respecting kids is a states rights issue?MR. SPICER: No, no, that's not -- you're trying to make an issue out of something that doesn't exist. It was the court who stopped this in August of last year. So where were the questions last year in August about this? It wasnt implemented correctly, legally, and the procedure wasnt followed because the court found, at the time, that it didn't have the authority to do that. So youre asking us why we're following the law that wasnt followed. And the reality is --Q  Well, I'm asking you why you're reversing the Obama directive --MR. SPICER: Hold on. No, no, we're not reversing it. Hold on. We're not reversing it. That is a misinterpretation of the scenario. The court stopped it. It enjoined it in August of last year because it wasnt properly drafted, and it didn't follow the procedures, and there was no legal basis for it in a law that was instituted in 1972.So hold on -- for you to use those terms, frankly, doesn't reflect what the situation actually is and how it happened. That's just -- so to talk about us reversing something that was stopped by the courts.Q  I understand that --MR. SPICER: No, no, but --Q  -- but you're sending a message --MR. SPICER: No, we're not. We're basically saying that its a states rights issue. If a state choses to do it, as I mentioned to April, when this circumstance came up at one of the Presidents own properties, he was very clear about his position on this. So for you to turn around and say what message is the President saying, where was the message when he sent it last year? I think the message shows that hes a guy with a heart that understands the trouble that many people go through.But he also believes that the proper legal recourse for this is with the states. He believes in the states ability to determine whats right for their state versus another state. Q  I understand what you're saying. But the LGBTQ community yesterday said they felt --MR. SPICER: I understand what --Q  -- that what they perceiving is that those kids are not being respected. MR. SPICER: But theres a difference what people may or may not feel and the legal process and the law. And the law right now doesn't allow for it under Title IX that was passed in 1972. And the procedure wasnt followed. The court saw this in August of last year for a reason. And all we're doing is saying that the proper place for this is in the states.And so for you to suggest what message is this sending, its very simple: that its a states rights issue, and the states should enact laws that reflect the values, principles, and will of the people in their particular state. That's it, plain and simple.Q  Moving on to Obamacare very quickly, former House Speaker John Boehner predicted that a full repeal and replace of Obamacare -- his words -- is not going to happen. He went on to say, Most of the framework of the Affordable Care Act, its going to be there. Do you think that he has a point? Are you going to --MR. SPICER: Well, no, I think -- look, I think what we're going to end up with is something that Ive talked about over and over again. We're going to end up with a more accessible plan that will allow people to see more doctors, have more providers, and drive costs down. Those are the two guiding principles that we're going to have in what the President is going to work with Congress to put forward on. That's it, plain and simple.Yes.Q  Sean, on roads and highways in the United States, in many places around the country potholes and other issues are affecting the way in which Americans travel. And the President has said he would fix these issues during the campaign. What is the status on that? And has the President spoken to heads of DOT or other people?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the President is starting to address that through the budget process we talked about yesterday. It will be out in mid-March. And so the infrastructure projects and priorities that the President has talked about -- whether its air control, and our airports, or the roads and bridges -- will be something that hes going to work with DOT, but also talk about in his budget. And youll see more in his joint address to Congress.With that, Laurel Staples of KECI-NBC in Montana.Q  Montana has hundreds of miles of border with Canada. And according to the U.S. Department of Transportation, almost 1 million people come across that border into Montana each year. What are the administrations plans to increase security on the Canadian border? And does the administration have any plans to build a wall there? (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: Well, we're obviously concerned -- thank you -- at all sorts of immigration in this country, whether its from our northern border or our southern border. I think the President understands that our southern border is where we have more of a concern in terms of the number of people and the type of activity that's coming over there in terms of the cartels and drug activity. But that doesn't mean that we're not paying attention to our northern border, as well. And we will continue to both monitor and take steps necessary at our northern border to ensure the safety of all Americans.Yes, sir.Q  One question on the South China Sea and a follow-up on the Dakota Access Pipeline.This week was the first week, I believe, that the Trump administration launched freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea. Can you give us a sense of how frequently you are going to be doing those?And then on the Dakota Access Pipeline, a few weeks ago President Trump said he would try to negotiate a solution between the Standing Rock Sioux and Energy Transfer Partners. Why hasnt the President intervened and tried to initiate those negotiations yet?MR. SPICER: So on the latter, our team has been in contact with all the parties involved. They have been working and communicating back and forth. So if we have an update on that -- but there has been work at the staff level between the parties.And then on the second -- on the first part, Ive got no further update in terms of the frequency by which we will have stuff.Alexis.Q  Sean, in the Reuters interview with the President, he described again his interest in seeing the nuclear arsenal expand in the United States. Can you describe what it is that the President has in mind -- the timeframe and how he would like to pursue that?MR. SPICER: Yes, lets just be clear. He didn't -- what he was very clear on is that the United States will not yield its supremacy in this area to anybody. That's what he made very clear in there. And that if other countries have nuclear capabilities, it will always be the United States that has the supremacy and commitment to this.Obviously, that's not what we're seeking to do. The question that was asked was about other people growing their stockpiles. And I think what he has been clear on is that our goal is to make sure that we maintain Americas dominance around the world, and that if other countries cloud it, we don't sit back and allow them to grow theirs.Francesca.Q  Sean, a domestic policy question and then a foreign policy question, if you will. You said yesterday that the President had named a task force on the voter fraud probe. When did he name that task force specifically?MR. SPICER: I think two weeks ago he announced that Vice President Pence would lead that task force, and that the Vice President and his team were starting to look at members to do that.Q  So you were referring to the interview in which he said there would be a task force.MR. SPICER: That's right.Q  Not that something has happened since then.MR. SPICER: That's correct.Q  Okay. And then on foreign policy, the President had said in his Saturday campaign speech that the Gulf States would be paying for that safe zone in Syria. Which Gulf States was he referring to? Have any committed to paying for that?MR. SPICER: So if you look at the readouts that hes had with several of the foreign leaders that is brought up and mentioned in almost every one of them. And I think hes talked about the financing of the safe zones and the commitment that they need to make to those. And I think by and large, we've had widespread commitment. When we have an update on -- and I think that's an issue that's going to be ongoing at the Secretary of State level, as well, where you saw Secretary Tillerson follow up on that with numerous folks.We will have further updates on the funding of safe zones as we go forward. But there has been a general commitment by most of these heads of government to share in the Presidents commitment to help fund these things.Can I go to Steve Gruber of WJIM in Michigan?Q  Thank you, Sean. I greatly appreciate it. Id like to talk to you more about tax policy, if I may. President Trump, of course, on the campaign trail talked a lot about tax policy and tax reform. That hasnt happened yet, as we know. But I want to talk about something different. That's the border adjustability tax. With the manufacturers that were at the White House again today, states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, others have a great concern about this tax, and there seems to be a disconnect between some of the CEOs, some of the Republicans on Capitol Hill and the President as to whether or not this is appropriate. And I guess the question is: Could this tax have a chilling effect on manufacturing at a time when places like Ohio, and Michigan, and the Upper Midwest are trying to jumpstart the economy with manufacturing jobs? I wish for you to clarify, if you could, the Presidents position.MR. SPICER: Yes, Steve, thank you. I think the President has been very clear from the beginning that there is no tax if companies manufacture in the United States. We are one of only a handful of countries that doesn't tax the imports that come into our country. Almost every other country operates their tax code under that system.And so what happens is we have a system by which companies abroad can send their products -- tax our products going into their country and institute an import tax, and then their products come into the United States with no import tax -- which, frankly, gives a disincentive to companies to stay in the United States, to manufacture in the United States, to hire in the United States. And it tilts the field against the American worker.And so the President is looking at tax policy that encourages manufacturing and job creation in the United States. And if you think about it --Q  So where is he on this border adjustability tax? MR. SPICER: Hold on.Q  Where is he on this tax specifically?MR. SPICER: I understand that. And I think that what he is doing is he met yesterday with his team on the budget. Hes talked to Secretary Mnuchin and others who are working on a comprehensive tax reform plan. And remember, Steve, this isnt something that's been done since 1986. And so as we look at it, part of that is to make sure that we lower our corporate tax rate, that we make it more attractive to manufacture and grow jobs in the United States, to make our companies more competitive with companies overseas that, frankly, have better tax treatment than our own companies who stay in the United States. So creating more of a playing field that encourages manufacturing and growing and creating in the United States. But make no mistake, if a company is in the United States already and expanding in the United States, it will be only to their benefit. Actually, if you think about it right now, the way the current tax code works, it almost incentivizes companies from leaving the United States, manufacturing, and expanding overseas, and then sending their goods and services back to the United States, which undermines our own economy, it undermines our workers.Q  But the question is about components coming back in the United States being manufactured.MR. SPICER: I understand, Steve. Okay, I know that you're on the Skype, but we only do like one or two follow-ups. But the answer is, is that hes working towards comprehensive tax reform, and well have a plan out within the next few weeks that will address that.Yes.Q  On the transgender guidance, the administration not only rescinded it, but sent a letter to the Supreme Court informing them about the change as they consider a related case. Does the termination of the guidance present an administration position on the way the Supreme Court should rule?MR. SPICER: Im sorry, on? Well, obviously, were -- Im sorry -- removing the guidance clearly does. The guidance that was put forward by the Obama administration, which clearly hadnt been done in a proper way in terms of how they solicited, or, rather, didnt solicit comments -- the guidance it puts forward obviously sends a signal to the Court on where the administration stands on this issue.Q  Can I ask you about Syria? Two quick questions. First, the talks have started again, peace talks in Geneva. The man convening them, Staffan de Mistura, says hes not detected a clear strategy on the political track from the administration. So what is the Presidents thinking on that? And in particular, whats his thinking on the future of President Assad, whether he can stay on in a transition or --MR. SPICER: I will refer you to the State Department on the status of the talks.Q  But the overall strategy comes from here. MR. SPICER: Right, I understand that. And thats one of the things that the President, whether its safe zones or how we deal with Syria and the problems that --Q  What's the President thinking on Assads future? Just the key points.MR. SPICER: I understand that, thank you.Q  One other question then on Syria, if you dont mind. The fall of al-Bab in northern Syria, an important development on the battlefield, creates some space in that town thats fallen to the Turks and opposition. Is that the sort of space that the President would like to see a safe zone?MR. SPICER: I dont -- were not trying to be prescriptive right now in terms of the geographic location of a safe zone. Its something that -- right now, the Presidents goal is to get commitments from other world leaders, both in terms of the funding and the commitment to share in how we do that.So I dont want to get -- were not looking to be prescriptive today in how its done. I think, overall, we need a greater commitment in the region to make sure that people are committed to a strategy and to safe zones to allow that to stop some of the human suffering thats going on and create -- while the rest of the conflict ensues. And I think that weve got to dual-track this -- deal with the conflict as a whole and how we address it, how we deal with ISIS in combatting it, but then we also have to -- theres a humanitarian piece to this as well with respect to the safe zones.And I think that we were looking at both pieces of this as well.Q  Thanks, Sean. Since the election, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has expressed some disquiet about pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change. And the President has also heard from some world leaders about that. Can you tell us, is the President still committed to pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change?MR. SPICER: I think I will leave that to Secretary Tillerson. Thats a conversation that hes having with him as far as where we are on that.Q  Sean, thank you very much. I just have a follow-up to the Syria question first. Do you have any timeline when it comes to when he wants to see those safe zones actually being built? And I wanted to go back to the executive order on immigration. Youve talked about these dual-tracks, where youre going to be doing the new executive order but also continuing to fight that in court. Can you give us a status update on where that legal fight is and what we should see happening?MR. SPICER: So with respect to the executive order, there are several courts that this is being fought in -- 10 or so -- and we continue to deal with that in all of those venues. And then again, I guess, the only way to say this is, then obviously on the dual-track side we have the additional executive order that weve talked about earlier that will come out and further address the problems.We continue to believe that the issues that we face specifically in the 9th district -- 9th Circuit, rather, that we will prevail on, on the merits of that. But on the other challenges that have come and the other venues and the others -- that we feel equally confident, as we did in Massachusetts and other venues. So its not a single-track system. And Im sorry, I know you --Q  Have you made a decision yet about the Supreme Court taking it there? And then the other question was on the safe zones and the timeline.MR. SPICER: So with respect to the Supreme Court, I mean, weve got to continue to work this through the process. So right now its at the 9th Circuit. Thats the primary problem that we are addressing. And then we dont have any timeline that I can announce today on Syrian safe zones.Q  I just want to follow up to this mornings meeting. And the President said that he gave authorization to a couple of countries to buy military equipment from the United States. Which countries was he referring to? And has he gone to Congress to ask for permission to do this?MR. SPICER: Well follow up and get a list for you on that. Jeff.Q  Sean, if I could ask again about the delay of the executive order until the next week. Is the administration still trying to craft its legal argument to this to withstand scrutiny, or why again the delay? Im not sure I understand --MR. SPICER: Yeah, and I think I asked and answered this earlier. Q  Sorry, I dont understand the delay.MR. SPICER: Okay, then Ill explain it to you. I think the President this time -- we were very careful to understand what the courts concerns were and address them in the follow-up executive order. With respect to when were going to announce it, part of this is to make sure that we work with the appropriate departments and agencies on the implementation of it to make sure that it is executed and it continues to be executed in a flawless manner, and that it meets the intent that it would serve.We understand the challenges that may come, and so we want to do this in a manner that makes sure that the Hill, other members of Congress, the appropriate agencies and departments are fully ready to implement this when its issued. And so thats it. Theres really nothing more to it.Q  There also is some concern -- if I can follow up -- there also is concern inside the Justice Department and in Homeland Security by some officials this afternoon that were reporting that the White House is looking for them to help build this legal argument, to find a conclusion here.MR. SPICER: No, thats not -- basically, youre saying that we did our due diligence. We looked to the departments to ask them to review certain things. So last week it was we rushed stuff; this week, youre saying that we are taking our time and --Q  Has it been more difficult than you thought it would be?MR. SPICER: No, thats not true. I dont think so. And I think you using continued unnamed sources -- I think it actually is a -- it will be implemented flawlessly because weve done the right thing and gone to these individuals, sought feedback and guidance, and done this in an unbelievably comprehensive way to ensure that departments and agencies that are going to be executing and implementing this fully are aware of whats happening. But this has been done in a very, very comprehensive way. Yeah, sorry.Q  Thank you, Sean. Melanie Arter, CNSNews.com. Former Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder admitted that for a few years he unwittingly employed an illegal immigrant as a housekeeper. Is this administration committed to holding employers accountable when they employ illegal aliens? And how does the administration plan to do so?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think that was -- that issue was something that Mr. Puzder was very forthcoming on. And when he recognized the situation that had occurred, he paid all the appropriate taxes and tried to help the individual go through the proper process. And so, yeah, were going to continue to make sure that we hold individuals in compliance with the law. And he did the right thing then, but whether its companies or individuals, I think, we are committed to making sure that people do whats right.Yes, maam.Q  Veronica Clearly, with Fox 5. I have two questions. Janet Evancho -- she sang the National Anthem -- she requested a meeting with the President. Her sister is transgender. Is he going to take that meeting, or meet with anyone from the transgender community during this conversation?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think the President would be welcome to meet with her.Q  The second question -- second question. Steve Bannon today called the media the opposition party. Last week, there was lots of conversation about the fake news and us being the enemy of the people. Some have said that this is really just a branding of the media, where he did that in the primaries, branding Little Marco and Lyin Ted. Is this --MR. SPICER: Well, no, that was the President. Just to --Q  Right, of course. But is this a branding strategy to --MR. SPICER: No, I think thats what Steve believes.Q  But this is real.MR. SPICER: Absolutely, of course, its real. I dont think hed go out -- Steve has been very clear about his position on the media and how he believes it distorts things. So I dont think theres --Q  From the whole administration?MR. SPICER: No, no. Hold on. I just said that that is what Steves view is. Hes made it several times, and I think hes very clear on that.Sarah.Q  Thanks, Sean. Back to the border adjustment tax. President Trump has told Reuters that he does support some form of a border tax. How does the President respond to critics that are saying the border adjustment tax will be passed on to lower-income and middle-class families in the form of higher prices for goods and higher prices for gas?MR. SPICER: Well, I think if you look at holistically -- I mean, the first thing to understand is that there is no tax if youre manufacturing in the United States, so there can be no higher cost. But if you think about it right now, we have to look at this in a holistic way, which is, when a company chooses to leave our country and shed American jobs so they can move overseas, and then sell back to us at a lower price, theres a big cost that comes to our economy and to our workers. And so weve got to look at this comprehensively. But if a company chooses to stay and grow in the United States, hire more people, it actually will be a net savings, if you think about it, because it will be the companies who are overseas, who have chosen to move out of the country who will face a higher cost under these kind of plans. And thats a big difference. It will actually benefit consumers, benefit workers, and benefit out economy. And thats -- when you really think about the economic impact about that, that benefits our economy, it helps our American workers, it grows more jobs, it grows the manufacturing base. And again, we are probably one of only a handful of developed countries that dont have a tax system that looks at this. And so right now, its America and American workers and American manufacturing that are the disadvantage of the current regulatory and tax system, not the other way around.Thank you, guys. Have a great day. Well touch base tomorrow in some way. I will see you then. Tune in to CPAC to see the President.END3:52 P.M.

203,2017-02-24,"Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/24/2017","West Wing1:38 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Hey, guys. You saw the President signed an executive order today, another important step towards eliminating job-crushing regulations and keeping the government agencies accountable by getting America back to work, just as he promised to do. This afternoon, he's meeting with Governor Kasich. The President of Peru, as I mentioned yesterday, will be swinging by. Over the weekend, the President is going to be continuing to work on his joint address. He's hosting a dinner in the State Dining Room of our nation's governors. And the First Lady has a bunch of activities planned. There's a ball Sunday night that the First Lady is hosting for the governors and their spouses. And as I mentioned yesterday -- and I think that's kind of it. So with that, let me --Q  What is he going to talk to Kasich about?MR. SPICER: This is something that they wanted to get together after the election and catch up, and discuss sort of the issues and agenda that the President is implementing, and hopefully how some of these things -- I think coal will probably come up. But we'll try and see if we can get a readout of that afterwards. We generally dont provide readouts of that, but let me see what I can do.Q  Will the RNC come up?MR. SPICER: Will the RNC? What about the RNC?Q  About the convention that he didnt attend.MR. SPICER: Oh, I dont know. I doubt it. My guess is that we're talking about things going forward. It's obviously not for me to decide what the President discusses or what Governor Kasich decides to talk about.Q  Hey, Sean, just housekeeping-wise, can you just say why you decided to do this today off camera? And then can you talk about some of the information that has come out from senior administration officials this morning regarding some of the pushback on The New York Times reporting that was on background?MR. SPICER: I literally have said since day one that we would have some sort of gathering every day. The President spoke today. As you know, we dont generally do -- we havent done briefings when the President has had a major event or an event with a world leader. And we put it on the schedule yesterday that we were just going to gaggle. I dont -- I mean, this is something that we've talked about with the Correspondents' Association about making sure that we had daily contact with you guys. And I think -- obviously the President gave a very powerful speech today, and our job is to make sure that we're responsive to folks in the media. We're here all day. We've got a big staff. And we want to make sure we answer your questions. We dont need to do everything on camera every day. I think the President did a good job of making sure that -- today at CPAC, on camera, for a long time. And I wanted to make sure that the President's message carried. Oh, and then with respect to --Q  Can you talk about -- exactly, the pushback from this morning?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think -- we gathered with a small group this morning. And I think part of this is to make sure that, especially in the case of CNN in particular, it was -- you were -- I think several media outlets, who, a majority, frankly, carried it very responsibly in terms of how the events unfolded. But it's a pretty serious accusation. And when you see the chyrons on CNN and the headlines and their story making it appear as though we did something wrong or nefarious, we wanted to make sure that we set the record straight. And I think that this morning was an opportunity to push back on what actually happened and why it happened. And I think with respect to the events, just to be clear -- and I know we've gone over some of it -- that the deputy director of the FBI was at the White House for a 7:30 meeting, or whenever it was, the morning that the story came out. He asked to see the chief of staff after the meeting privately, and said, in very colorful terms, that The New York Times story was not accurate. As would anyone, frankly, at the time say, ""Could you clarify that then? If it's not true, could you clarify the story?"" The deputy director said, ""I'll get back to you."" When he got back to us, he said, hey, look, we dont want to get in the practice of starting to refute every story. The chief of staff said, well, you've put us in a very difficult situation; you've told us that a story that made some fairly significant accusations was not true. And now you want us to just go out there -- and I think that we have a right, if there's information, or if you're saying the story is not right, could you at least make it available to the media or some folks in the media that, yes, that story is not right? It made very, very serious allegations. And further in the day, the director of the FBI said to Reince that you have every right to go out there and say that you've been briefed by us, which he did.Q  So a clarification on that. And on ""Meet the Press,"" when the chief of staff obviously said that he had had permission from senior intelligence officials, he was speaking about McCabe, the deputy director?MR. SPICER: And the director.Q  So they had given him explicit permission?MR. SPICER: They said, literally the story in The New York Times is not accurate.Q  Sean, do you have any idea what --Q  Sorry, I just want to follow up on this thread. The President said today that he doesnt like the idea of unnamed sources. Obviously, this administration briefs on background, meaning on the condition that you not be named. Is that going to change now?MR. SPICER: No, no, but I'll give you a great example. This morning -- there's a big difference --Q  But --MR. SPICER: Hold on, Hallie, let me answer the question.Q  I didnt get to the question.MR. SPICER: Okay, go ahead.Q  Is there -- go ahead, you first.MR. SPICER: No, I didnt let you get to your question, so go ahead. Seriously, keep going.Q  The question was, do you plan to change that? Are you going to do all your briefings on the record?MR. SPICER: So there is, I think, a big difference -- this morning was an example where we wanted to have a free-flowing exchange with reporters. At the end of the conversation, several reporters said, can we use some of this on the record? We said yes. So the answer is, is that there is times when --Q  But it's --MR. SPICER: Hold on, Hallie. Let me just answer.Q  All right, I'm just flowing.MR. SPICER: I think there is an opportunity -- there's a way to use background sourcing to be able to have a much more robust discussion about some things. We came back, as the example this morning, and said, sure, there are quotes that you can use on the record. I think there's a big difference between explaining a policy and wanting to be able to have that kind of discussion where you say, hey, let's do this on background. And I think, generally speaking, we've been pretty open to saying, sure, we'll put those statements on -- or if you want to clear some stuff on the record, for the most part we've been very good about it.There's a big difference between making serious allegations -- us coming back on the record, and reporters saying, well, we have five sources that are unnamed that say contrary to that. I think there's a point at which there's an obligation, if you're going to make a very serious allegation, and we're willing to push back on the record that there be somebody at the very least that's willing to push back on this and say that they'll put their name attached to it. When you look at the reporting that The New York Times initially did, it was all background sources. It basically accused the President and his campaign team of doing some very, very serious stuff. We pushed back against that reporting at the time, and we were met with, ""Well, we have unnamed sources."" And I think there's an obligation at some when, if you're going to make allegations of a serious nature, to at least make somebody go on the record and say, yes, I'm willing to stand behind that, when we're willing to or another organization is willing to refute them on the record.So we often get met with us going on the record in multiple ways with reporters to only be told, ""Well, we're not going to believe you on the record because we've got one, two, three unnamed sources that we're not going to tell you who they are, where they're from, whether or not they're even in the circle of orbit."" And in many cases, when I push against reporters, I'll say, look, there were four people in that meeting -- here are the four people. Can you confirm any of them? ""Well, no they were people who heard from them."" So I've literally gone back to people and said, there is a room that occurred with four, five, six people in it, and this didnt happen because I was in the room. And they'll say, yeah, but people who were briefed by those people. So how many degrees of telephone do you play before at least you're willing to say, if someone in the room won't at least put their name on it or you won't admit that somebody in the room is willing to say it? I think that that undermines the credibility of some of the reporting that's going on.Q  Can you explain the distinction that the administration has drawn between a lot of conservative anger about the Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton conversation versus the obviously Reince Priebus-Deputy Director conversation? The administration has said its different because the Chief of Staff was talking about a report, a news report and not an investigation. But the report was about an investigation. So does the administration worry that the Chief of Staff has crossed the line?MR. SPICER: No, no, no, hold on, hold on. And I brought this up this morning -- sorry for those of you who have to listen to this twice -- lets reverse-engineer this in two ways. Number one, the deputy director comes to us. We didn't go to them. The differences in the case --Q  I'm not going to rehash, but I want to get this --MR. SPICER: No, no, I am. But I --Q  I think its important to get on the record.MR. SPICER: And I will. And, by the way, just as a side note, as I mentioned to one of your colleagues today, doing a gaggle doesn't preclude us from doing something on camera later today. And Im more than welcome -- I think the idea was that with time being what it is today, we wanted to just make sure that you guys got up-to-dated on a variety of issues.But theres nothing that precludes us from saying, hey, well go do an on-camera interview. So just the idea that we don't do something in the Briefing Room doesn't preclude. Here's the thing -- theres a big difference. The deputy director came to the chief of staff of the White House and literally said, the story is false.So here are the two scenarios. One is, the chief of staff says nothing and just stares at him, which is what some of the folks in this room believe he should have done, he should have just sat there and said -- (indicating) -- which, now if any of you -- the second piece of this is that nine times out of ten0, when I deal with you guys, and Ill say we had a big problem with the story in X publication or X outlet, the first question I get asked is: Well, did you push back? Did you ask for a correction? And I think in this case, the point is, is that all we simply did was say, wow, you're bringing us information saying that something -- a story in The New York Times is not accurate. So is there something that you're doing to let other journalists know that its not true? Because they're asking us.So that morning I got, lets say, five, ten, fifteen phone calls from you and your colleagues, saying, ""Hey, theres a report in The New York Times -- what do you think about it?"" Well, if someone is coming to us telling us that its not a true story, our goal was to literally just say to them, will your public affairs office take this phone call? Q  Sean, is there an expectation --MR. SPICER: I just want to be clear. I really am intrigued by I don't know what else we were supposed to do. We were provided information. And this notion that I see on CNN about we pushed back or we applied pressure. Pressure, by definition, is applying force. So if we had said, ""If you don't do this, if you don't do that,"" that's pressure. And I get that. That would have been wrong. ""We order you to do this. We require you to do that. We're urging"" -- we literally responded when presented with information and said, ""Could you let the media know that, what you're informing us of?"" And the answer was, well, we don't want to get in the middle of starting a practice of doing this. So our answer is, well, why did you come to us with this information if not to elicit a response? I don't know what else you do except for say, gosh, could you clear the record up? That is a very different scenario than trying to exert influence on a situation. We literally responded to what they came to us with and said, okay, what are you going to do about it?And again, if you take --Q  Did you --MR. SPICER: Hold on, Ill finish with this, because the thing that's interesting to me is that had we not done anything and just sat there, what would -- it would have been irresponsible and, frankly, malpractice to say, yes, I was informed that we didn't do anything, and yet I didn't act. Q  So we talked about this six hours ago, all that same stuff. Can we just move ahead a little bit here? Do you have any idea what McCabes motivation was in coming forward?MR. SPICER: No.Q  Because then he asked the Chief of Staff to call him back at the FBI, only to then be told from the FBI Headquarters, theres nothing we can do. And then it was a very small circle of people who knew about this, and yet it leaked.MR. SPICER: I think that's concerning. Again, remember the timetable. We didn't ask them for that meeting. Reince had never met the guy prior to that morning. He wouldnt have known who he was. And frankly -- so he showed up at a meeting. Director Comey was traveling that day. It was an intel meeting on a separate subject. So the idea that -- and again, they don't dispute -- from what I understand -- any of this chronology that he pulled him aside. So if you logically can ask yourself why would he have pulled him aside to update him on a story just to say, ""Hey, I know we've never met before, but I just wanted to know if you read the paper today""? Logically that makes zero sense. So I don't know what his motivations were. I don't -- I think hopefully to make sure that they knew that they were informing up what the status of the story was. And can I make one more claim? Because this just dovetails into something that Hallie asked. Just so we're clear -- because Ive seen a lot of reporting about was it proper or whatever -- first of all, theres nothing -- there is literally a memo out from past Attorneys General about how the DOJ will deal with the White House. There is literally a carve-out for dealing with public affairs. This is a story in The New York Times that was not accurate, according to them. So this idea about how we handled it, or how they handled it, there is literally in the memo -- which is all it is, its a guidance memo -- theres literally a carve-out that specifically addresses how to handle public affairs.Q  Let me just come back to the leak. Because you've got three people who were in this loop.MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  You've got the chief of staff of the White House. You've got the deputy director and the director of the FBI. MR. SPICER: Right.Q  And yet this somehow leaks. MR. SPICER: I think that's why the President --Q  If the President is pursuing leaks, it would seem that he doesn't have to look too far.MR. SPICER: And that's why I think you've seen the Presidents tweet on this today, and you've heard the Presidents comments. He is not just today, but last week at the press conference. This is troubling when an FBI or anyone in the intelligence world, or, frankly, anyone in government entrusted with classified information and national security information is sharing that information widely. Yeah, that's a big problem. And I think you've seen the Presidents concern for this issue.Q  Should he fire somebody? Is he going to fire Director Comey?MR. SPICER: Im not going to -- I think I will leave it at the Presidents tweet speaks for itself, and the Presidents comments on his concern for national security -- yes, its concerning. Overall -- overall, its concerning.Charlie.Q  Pulling back, this Russia narrative continues to dog the administration and its something that Americans have been paying attention to, it's something the media has been paying attention to. How do you -- whats your goal to sort of end this narrative? Is there any way you could answer more questions, do more things to finish this thing that started right after the election, that somehow the President has an improper relationship with Russia? Is he prepared to answer some of these questions, release some more details to finally put an end to this? Or are we just going to continue to find out about his connections through these leaks?MR. SPICER: Well, again, there are no connections to find out about. That's the problem. I think, A, hes answered it forcefully. You can't disprove something that doesn't exist. Hes talked about the fact how many times hes talked to Putin. He has no interests in Russia. He has no -- theres only so many times he can deny something that doesn't exist. Q  Until another leak comes out?MR. SPICER: But what are the leaks? The leaks don't actually -- again, you've got a story that comes out from The New York Times with unnamed sources. You have the FBI coming to us. And frankly -- and I don't -- I know that I do a really good job of lecturing you guys, so Ill try to stay silent on a Friday. But to some degree the true story -- and Chairman Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee is on the record saying that he received a report and corroborates it. At some point, isnt the story that actually the accusations that came out have been disputed?Q  I guess the question is --MR. SPICER: Hold on. The House Intelligence Committee came out, after getting the briefing, and said that the story is demonstrably false. And I dont mean to put words into the chairmans mouth there. I think hes quoted in the Wall Street Journal. But, at some point, isnt the story actually that there is no story, to your point; that its been disproven, and its not the level to which The New York Times has made it to be?But all we have done from the get-go is exactly what youre asking, which is to continue to disprove a negative.Q  Sean, on that -- but continuing with that though, are you then saying that you would encourage, not interfere with, and not in any way encourage the Attorney General to suppress the investigation? Because there is some suggestion of that. Putting this story aside, there is a suggestion that there is suppression.MR. SPICER: I know, but the only suggestion, Margaret, with all due respect, is from you guys. There was -- we were not aware of --Q  Actually, its not. There --MR. SPICER: No, no, no -- but who? So you have someone like Nancy Pelosi coming out and making a wildly inappropriate statement. Q  I'm speaking specifically to the Department of Justice, not Capitol Hill. MR. SPICER: I understand that. But in other words, were not aware of an investigation, so how would we be able to -- well, Im sorry, what was the word that you used?Q  Suppression.MR. SPICER: But, but -- so if youre going to make an accusation like that, where is the evidence that there has been anything that A, exists, or B, that weve suppressed anything?Q  But the question was, are you actually saying any investigation -- if there was any reason to investigate, the Department of Justice should go ahead, because there is a --MR. SPICER: Sure.Q  -- suggestion at the Department of Justice, on the --MR. SPICER: Sure, if there is evidence of anything --Q  -- that there is --MR. SPICER: No, thats their job. Look --Q  -- (inaudible) question.MR. SPICER: Right. And I think weve made it clear that if theres evidence of something, pursue it. And weve said that very clearly about the House and Senate. There is nothing to -- we have nothing to hide. The President has been crystal-clear consistently over and over again. And my point to you is that at some point you use words like ""suppression"" or ""investigation"" -- then show us. Where's this investigation? Where is the suppression that's occurring? Where's the so-called pushback or pressure? I mean, respectfully, guys, I dont -- I find a lot of this offensive. When you talk about us pushing back on something that doesnt exist, at some point answer the opposite -- which is, what were we supposed to do when presented by information by them? Sit back and do nothing? Q  I'm not speaking about that point and case. I'm talking about at the Department of Justice, writ large, investigating ties to Russia. Is that an investigation that should continue to proceed?MR. SPICER: If they have an investigation, then they should do what they want. They should follow the law.Q  And is that the message that the President has delivered to the Attorney General? MR. SPICER: I mean, he literally swore him in. I think something like, I hope you execute the -- I mean, why would he have to -- again, respectfully, it's insulting that the President would have to tell the Attorney General to follow the law. Did you ask the same question about Obama with respect to Holder? I mean, with all of the stuff that went out there, did you --Q  There are reports and those are lines of questions that --MR. SPICER: Did you ever ask that question?Q  I wasnt covering that case, but there were reporters at my network who did.MR. SPICER: They did? So they did. You can --Q  I believe it was CBS that broke the ""Fast and Furious"" story. But anyway, moving --MR. SPICER: That's not what I asked. No, no, I didnt ask that question. I'm saying, did you ever question the White House, or did CBS, on the record, question the Obama administration whether or not they asked the Attorney General to follow the law?Q  But there is -- Sean --MR. SPICER: No, see what you just did? You told ---Q  I'm trying to answer you. There is a sort of boilerplate speaking point, talking point to say we dont want to impede an ongoing investigation, we hope that all those thing --MR. SPICER: Did you ever ask the Obama administration the same question?Q  About this? No.MR. SPICER: No, about whether or not they asked Attorney General Holder to follow the law. These boilerplate language --Q  There were plenty of questions about interference --MR. SPICER: No, no, look --Q  Yes, there were plenty of questions about interference.MR. SPICER: So you can you tell me that CBS asked the White House that same question?Q  About whether the Justice Department was interfering in investigations?MR. SPICER: Would follow the law, would use this ""boilerplate language""?Q  Yes.MR. SPICER: Okay.Q  But to the point, there are people that --MR. SPICER: No, no, no, but you dont get to pivot, Margaret.Q  I'm not. I'm actually asking to stay on the topic, which was the topic of the Russia investigation, not what you're talking about. So on the topic of the Russia investigation, what you have said is there is no knowledge at the White House of any investigation into ties with Russia?MR. SPICER: I am not aware of an investigation. If there was one, then they should follow the law. But I dont think -- I will definitely try to look for whether or not CBS asked the same question to the White House during the eight years of the Obama administration. Because at least I never saw that.Q  Sean, can you say why Mr. Priebus wanted -- when he talked to McCabe -- why did he then want the FBI to go do, on their own, bat this story down? Was there something about it being more credible if the FBI were to speak up about than if it was just coming from --MR. SPICER: Okay, so just stop for a second. Let's walk through this logically. I come to you and say, hey, there's evidence that whatever you've been accused of is not true. What's your response? No, no, answer the question.Q  You said to me that there's evidence of --MR. SPICER: So you've been accused of some wrongdoing, and I come to you and say, hey, guess what -- the accusations that you've been accused of I know they arent true.Q  I'd love for you to tell everybody. I'm asking specifically in this case. I'm just asking in this case was there a sense, on this subject matter, which is politically very loaded, where you feel you havent been treated well, that it would be more useful for the administration if the FBI spoke up --MR. SPICER: No, it's not a question of useful. They came to us and said, this story is not true. We said, great, could you tell people that? Reporters are asking us, we've denied it. We did deny it. I'm really having a tough time understanding the logic of your question. They story gets printed in The New York Times. Just to be clear, let's think about this for a second. If we knew that this story was false and we wanted the FBI to pressure, wouldnt we have asked the day before when the story was coming out?Q  I wasnt suggesting you asked them to pressure. That was not the premise of the question.MR. SPICER: So they come to us with information that morning and say, the story that was published is not accurate. What should have been the White House's response?Q  I'm not going to say what your response should have been. But do you see what I'm asking is --MR. SPICER: No, I dont. I really dont. I think it's insane. I think it really -- the idea that you're saying someone tells you that something is false --Q  Did you think that denial would be more credible if it came from the FBI instead of from you?MR. SPICER: Of course, it would. Because the story listed intelligence sources as saying -- The New York Times said, according to multiple sources in the intelligence community, this is false. If the FBI and part of the intelligence community says, we believe it's false, it came out after we had denied it -- and, of course, The New York Times didnt believe us, said, oh, we have X number of sources in the intel community, you're wrong -- why wouldnt we want someone with credibility who's saying, we have no evidence that this story is accurate, come out and say that?Q  I guess what I'm aiming towards is, are you trying to -- do you guys feel like there's been background sources from the intelligence community saying things that you dispute, that you dont like? Is this part of a broader effort to get the intelligence community --MR. SPICER: That's barely -- you show a lack of -- I mean --Q  To go on the record.MR. SPICER: No, no, hold on, hold on. Just stop for a second. They come to us and say, ""The New York Times is quoting intelligence sources claiming X, Y and Z. We dont believe that that's accurate."" ""Okay, could you please let people know that that's not true?""Q  And I'm saying, when you say that, is that a way of asking them to get their house in order if these sources are talking --MR. SPICER: No, it's a way of saying -- if someone witnesses something that happened and says, I'm willing to go out and say that, hey, I saw that actually the car went right and not left, and I can clear this up -- wouldnt you want the witness to do that? The FBI is saying, we are in the intelligence business, we didnt think that story was accurate; we wanted you to know. Our answer is, great, reporters are calling us -- could you let them know?Q  But I think that happens pretty regularly, that the FBI tells you something and they are not deciding whats going to go into the public sphere or not. Thats your job, right?MR. SPICER: Not if -- we had to -- I mean, no, actually it doesnt, to be honest with you. Its the first time that Ive seen it happen. Obviously, we had never had -- the chairman had never -- the chief of staff had never met this guy before. So for him to come over and say, hey, by the way -- no, that doesnt -- at least in my 30-some-odd days, its never happened.Q  I guess what I was wondering is why its so unusual for them to want the White House, the political component, to be the ones deciding about what gets put --MR. SPICER: I dont know, ask them. Again, I hate to probably break some norm, but maybe you should direct your question to them. I know thats probably -- now youre going to have stories about how I directed reporters to call the public affairs office to do --Q  But I'm asking you the question. MR. SPICER: No, no, because -- I know, and Ive asked and answered it, like, 18 times. Q  Sean, did Reince talk to counsel, the White House Counsels Office after he talked to McCabe?MR. SPICER: I dont -- its possible. Its very possible that they were in the initial meeting. Im sure that he has followed up with counsel and said, hey, I just was told this -- at some point.Q  This is a bit of a difficult situation and what do we do. MR. SPICER: But again, at the beginning part, the answer was to tell -- to say to McCabe, hey, let us know how you want to handle this.Q  So that secondary --MR. SPICER: Just remember the response, which is, it wasnt a directive. We didnt say, ""Go do the following."" Thats a directive. That could be -- we literally said, ""What can you do to help get the world out? Could you take calls from reporters? Will you clear this up?"" Q  But that kind of, ""what could you do"" wasnt -- to your knowledge it wasnt after he had spoken to counsel and said --MR. SPICER: Oh, no, it was immediate.Q  Okay. MR. SPICER: Like, ""Hey, what can you do?"" And the answer that McCabe gave was, ""Give me a few hours to get back to you and see what we can do.""Q  So you know what McCabe went away and did in those two hours? I mean, was he talking to his own counsel?MR. SPICER: I dont know. You should ask him. I dont want to --Q  Okay. Q  Sean, going forward, then, with the FBI, you have a fundamental persistent dispute with them about them stepping into such matters and --MR. SPICER: I dont -- in terms of what, Dave?Q  In terms of if this situation arises again where they have information that they could back down an untrue story --MR. SPICER: I think that the FBI -- sure. I mean, if the FBI knows something to be false, unless it hinders intelligence-gathering, an ongoing investigation, I dont want to get in the -- I mean, our job isnt to get in the way of them doing their job, i.e. investigating something or uncovering a plot, or whatever theyre doing. If theres some reason that they have to act in accordance to protect this country, they should by all means do it. But to come to somebody and say, youve been accused of some pretty serious things and we know them not to be accurate, I would assume that you would want -- I mean, isnt their job justice? I mean, thats -- I mean, if you wrote a story that was knowingly false and somebody came to you and said, I know, Dave, that the story you wrote is false and Ive got some facts to prove it, I would hope and I do believe that you would say, get them to me and Im going to update the story. If this was you, and you had written a story and someone from the FBI came to you and said, hey, I know you wrote that story, Dave, or, Hallie, I saw your package last night, and, gosh, were in the intel community and Im willing to let you know its not accurate -- I would assume that your answer would be, okay, what do I need to do to correct it, or what can I do, or what can you give me. Q  So the administration still maintains there is no investigation.MR. SPICER: No, thats not what I said, Charlie. No. I literally said then when presented with a story that we were told was not accurate, our answer was, could you go tell other people that its not accurate or correct it, or whatever you see fit. But what are we doing to get the story or the facts straight?Q  So you dont know whether or not there is an investigation.MR. SPICER: I know nothing more than they told us a story was not accurate. And our answer was, what are you going to do to get the story right. It wasnt -- thats it, full stop. There was no discussion about anything beyond the story. And the story wasnt right. And I believe he used --Q  So youre not aware of any investigation into Russia, did I misunderstand that?MR. SPICER: Im not aware of one. Huh? You asked me if I was aware. I am not. Q  Is the administration?MR. SPICER: I dont -- thats a pretty broad term. Im not aware of one. And so --Q  More broadly then, to this point, is there concern -- or what does this say about the relationship between the administration and the FBI, given that you used words like concerned, troubling, talking about leaks? Should Americans be concerned about fallout between the White House and the FBI?MR. SPICER: I think you should -- no, I mean, all I know is theyve told us some information, weve asked them to help get the word out. Thats where it stands.Q  But you called the potential leaks troubling and concerning. MR. SPICER: No, I was asked about the leaks, Hallie.Q  But you directed us back to the Presidents tweet, which says, The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security 'leakers'. Are we to deduce that the President has lost confidence in the FBI and the Director?MR. SPICER: I think that Im going to let the Presidents tweet stand for itself. But I think that -- and again, I think he commented on this last week, that there is a concern -- these are two separate issues. One is the instance at hand and the story that came out, and the second is the leaks that are coming out.Q  And on a sort of semi-related note, this banner on CNN right now that says ""CNN and others have been blocked from media briefings,"" are CNN and The New York Times not in here right now because youre unhappy with their reporting? And why are they not in here?MR. SPICER: Because we had a pool and then we expanded it, and we added some folks to come and cover it.Q  But theres enough room for others in here.MR. SPICER: It was my decision to decide -- you know, to expand the pool. Yeah.Q  Sean, the President said today at CPAC, Were going to do something about it in reference to these stories that he is saying are false by The New York Times and CNN and others. What is he talking about there?MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, say the beginning.Q  He said, We are going to do something about it when he was referencing --MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think were going to aggressively push back. Were just not going to sit back and let false narratives, false stories, inaccurate facts get out there. Q  In terms of leaks, whats the next step? The President has been concerned --MR. SPICER: The President is not going to tell you how hes going to handle this. Obviously, that would undermine the ability to block them if people knew what he was going to do or how he was going to handle it.Q  Can I first ask about the shooting in Kansas of the two Indian Americans and what the Presidents response to it was, but also if theres any concern that some of the rhetoric that the President or -- that generally has been out here recently could have contributed in any way to that or stepped up violence?MR. SPICER: I mean, obviously, any loss of life is tragic, but Im not going to get into, like, that kind of -- to suggest that theres any correlation I think is a bit absurd. So Im not going to go any further than that.Q  Can I ask about the CEA? Politico is saying that Kevin Hassett is the Presidents choice. Im wondering if you can confirm that.MR. SPICER: I can't. Q  And then more broadly, the CEA is not among the Presidents Cabinet positions anymore and Im wondering if you can explain --MR. SPICER: I dont think it was during Bush, was it?Q  I know it was under Obama.MR. SPICER: Okay, so whats -- okay. Some positions are and some positions arent. I mean, there are --Q  Well, can you just explain the logic behind --MR. SPICER: No, I cant. I mean, I think the President makes a decision -- he can always expand his Cabinet. But I think that theres some Cabinet positions that each administration decides are part of their Cabinet, some arent. And I think the President has an unbelievably talented group of economic advisors, from Steve Mnuchin to Wilbur Ross to Robert Lighthizer, should he be confirmed by the Senate, as well as Wilbur and others.So its every Presidents prerogative to decide beyond the statutory members of the Cabinet who else to have included.Q  Can I follow up on the shooting? You mentioned that -- is it the -- what part is the absurd? I guess Im just --MR. SPICER: Well, its absurd to suggest that rhetoric. And I think the point that was at least -- I think the --Q  I mean, the comment from the man supposedly is, Get out of my country. Is it a question of its too early to call it a hate crime?MR. SPICER: No, no, no, but I think theyre pointing out -- at least what I thought was being asked is, is there any, like -- was it your intention to suggest that there was, like, a connection between --Q  I mean, I think that -- I didn't want to say, this person did -- I mean, I don't think any of us could know that possibly.MR. SPICER: Well, I think to sort of -- to right now intimate what the motives are is too early. I mean, I guess my point is to sort of jump to a conclusion. We've seen that too often in the past -- in Florida and other places where people jump to a conclusion. This is -- we're not going to be subject to calling a video as the Clinton -- as the Obama administration did. I mean, let's let law enforcement do its job before we start jumping to conclusions.Q  Do you know of any other parts of the administration looking into this potentially? The Department of Justice, for example, maybe?MR. SPICER: I don't have anything for you on this. Q  So today, President Trump talked about how he's going to build up the military, there's going to be a big funding request. Can you talk about how much money does the President think he's going to need to ask for? And how is this going to be paid for?MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's two things. One, I think he'll touch on this in the joint address. But, secondly, the budget that's come out will be very clear about where a lot of that funding will come from. And so I don't want to get ahead of either of those, but I will -- I think they're good questions that will be answered in due time, both beginning with the joint address -- we'll touch on that. And, second, from a more detailed standpoint, the budget, specifically with respect to the savings and how savings and how additional funding would be processed.Q  And regarding the joint address, do you imagine the joint address will be kind of like this very broad, like overhead look at what the President plans to do? Or will it be very specific, like bullet points, this is what we're going to do, very specific policies that we're going to enact?MR. SPICER: I think it will be a little bit of a blend. More so the former than the latter. I think he's going to talk very optimistically about where we're going to go as a country and the general policies that he's going to pursue to get us there. I don't think this is going to be the same old Christmas tree kind of State of the Union. And I think there is a little bit of a traditional tweak between a joint address and a State of the Union. Q  Is the President going to meet with insurers on Monday?MR. SPICER: I'll have Lindsay get out -- we're going to get the schedule together. I think --Q  Sean --MR. SPICER: Hold on, I told Gabi, and then I've got to be downstairs.Q  Okay, I have a question on the budget. With so few Cabinet Secretaries confirmed right now, is the White House working with agencies to ensure that their submissions are being --MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Okay, and do you expect the budget to be thin because of the absence of Cabinet Secretaries?MR. SPICER: No.Q  Okay.MR. SPICER: I think -- I mean, it may be thin, but that's because of -- I'm joking. I think the President's commitment to getting Washington in order is going to be very apparent in the budget, and his desire to respect taxpayers and duplicity in government and programs that are outdated is going to be very much reflected in the budget.But we start that process sometime next week, where they start the passback process of going through departments and what their top lines are and things like that.Q  If I could just ask one more question on immigration. Before the President was inaugurated, he said that approximately 2 million to 3 million criminal illegal aliens would be deported during his first year in office. But according to the guidance that Secretary Kelly sent out earlier this week, they are now saying that law enforcement officials should be also looking at apprehending and deporting low-level criminal illegal immigrants and anybody that DHS deems a public risk.How does the administration -- I mean, number one, can we expect that figure -- 2 million to 3 million -- to expand now that it seems the definition of criminal illegal aliens has expanded? And also, how are you going to ensure that somebody who didn't just get a traffic ticket isn't included in that -- under that definition?MR. SPICER: I'm not -- we're not going to ensure anything. I mean, that's the job of ICE -- or DHS and then, more specifically, ICE, is to look at who is in this country, where they sit on that. But it is not the job of the White House to get involved and do carve-outs about misdemeanor versus that. People who I think -- I would actually just leave it at you should contact ICE in terms of how they're prioritizing this.Our job was to make sure that they were enforcing the laws and achieving the mission, protecting the nation, and I'll leave it at that.Q  Was that something that the White House had spoken with Secretary Kelly about? About expanding the definition of the individuals it would include?MR. SPICER: I would touch base with Secretary Kelly's office and then ICE. But our job was to give them -- the executive order and the guidance they put out I think is pretty explicit as far as describing how that executive order is going to be carried out. And then Secretary Kelly lays out very specifically how they're going to achieve that. So if you look at the factsheet and the letters that he put out, I think it lays it out pretty well.Q  Is the President hoping to have this executive order on immigration done before the joint session to Congress? And can you talk a little bit about -- you've talked about the delay in it is related to the fact that there's been more communication with other agencies to make sure this is rolled out appropriately. Can you talk about what -- I mean, what is the President looking for to get from these agencies?MR. SPICER: I think we're just trying to make sure that it is done precisely with a precision that he expects to make sure that we achieve the goal of the executive order when it's issued.Q  Sean, on healthcare, there's a new executive -- a new draft bill, a draft proposal that's been circulating on Capitol Hill that's now been made public that, for example, shrinks Medicaid expansion, scales back subsidies, et cetera. Is this something the President would support?MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into what we are or are not going to support. That's my understanding, from media reports, is that that's a House draft and I would respectfully ask that you follow up with them.Q  Real quick yes or no. The President said at CPAC this morning that we're going to see the biggest buildup of the military in American history. Can we take that to the bank? Is that a real promise? Or is that --MR. SPICER: I think you can take what the President says to the bank.Thank you, guys. I've got to get downstairs.Q  One more question just about the idea that it seems as though you're playing favorites with media outlets by excluding some from this conversation.MR. SPICER: You're my favorite. (Laughter.) Q  No, that's not what I'm asking. But do you have a response to that, though, given that that is a concern to some that want to see press have access to you, all out?MR. SPICER: No, I think that -- right -- I think that we have shown an abundance of accessibility. We've brought more reporters into this process. And the idea that every time that every single person can't get their question answered or fit in a room that we're excluding people -- we've actually gone above and beyond with making ourselves, our team and our briefing room, more accessible than probably any prior administration. So I think you can take that to the bank. When you look at --Q  But why not those other outlets today?MR. SPICER: Because, Cecilia, there's 3,000 people that are credentialed to come in here.Q  But there are six outlets that want to be in here right now. The New York Times --MR. SPICER: No, there's not. Actually, that is false. To say that there are six -- maybe six that reached out to you, but that is not --Q  Well, but --MR. SPICER: No, no, hold on --Q  -- listed in the White House Correspondents' Association's response to this.MR. SPICER: I understand that. There are way more than six that wanted to come in. We started with the pool and then we expanded it. So I get it. But why -- I can ask -- there are plenty that want to come in at all times for every event. We do what we can to be accessible. And if there's a problem with that, I understand it. But we do what we can to accommodate the press. I think we've gone above and beyond when it comes to accessibility and openness and getting folks to -- our officials, our team. And so, respectfully, I disagree with the premise of the question.Thank you.END2:18 P.M. EST",20821.76,11.43999999999869,5845.31,9.800000000000182,2367.34,3.5300000000002

206,2017-02-24,Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Executive Order on Regulatory Reform,"Oval Office 12:07 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you all very much for being here. We have tremendous people standing behind me, and the biggest in the world in terms of manufacturing and business. Some of the people involved are Ken Fisher and Ken Frazier, Chairman and President, CEO of Merck. Alex Gorsky, Chairman, CEO of Johnson and Johnson. Marillyn Hewson -- and she has been very tough to deal with but thats okay -- (laughter) -- shes a very tough negotiator, President of Lockheed Martin. Gregory Hayes, Chairman and CEO, United Technology. Andrew Liveris, my friend Andrew, Chairman and CEO of Dow Chemical Company. Mario Longhi, the President, CEO, United States Steel Corporation. Juan Luciano, Chairman, President, CEO of Archer Daniels Midland Company. Denise Morrison, President of Campbells Soup Company. Lee Styslinger III, Chairman and CEO of Altec, Inc. Mark Sutton, Chairman, CEO of International Paper. And Inge Thulin, Chairman, President of 3M Company.And we have made tremendous progress with these great business leaders -- amazing progress. Theyre getting together in groups and theyre coming up with suggestions about their companies and how to bring jobs back to the United States. And I think it will be a fantastic day for the country.And we met yesterday, and -- I met with these folks and some more. Excessive regulation is killing jobs, driving companies out of our country like never before. Although, I must say, I think weve stopped it to a large part, Marillyn, right?MS. HEWSON: Right.THE PRESIDENT: Reducing wages and raising prices. Ive listened to American companies and American workers. Ive been listening to them for a long time. Ive been listening to them complain for a long time. But today, this executive order directs each agency to establish a regulatory reform task force, which will ensure that every agency has a team of dedicated -- and a real team of dedicated people to research all regulations that are unnecessary, burdensome and harmful to the economy, and therefore harmful to the creation of jobs and business.Each task force will make recommendations to repeal or simplify existing regulations. The regulatory burden is for the people behind me and for the great companies of this country, and for small companies -- an impossible situation, were going to solve it very quickly. They will also have to really report every once in a while to us so we can report on the progress, and so we can come up with some even better solutions.This executive order is one of many ways were going to get real results when it comes to removing job-killing regulations and unleashing economic opportunity. Weve already issued an order which says that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. So that in itself is going to be tremendous, but what were doing is much more than even that.Every regulation should have to pass a simple test: Does it make life better or safer for American workers or consumers? If the answer is no, we will be getting rid of it and getting rid of it quickly. We will stop punishing companies for doing business in the United States. Its going to be absolutely just the opposite. Theyre going to be incentivized for doing business in the United States.Were working very hard to roll back the regulatory burdens so that coal miners, factory workers, small-business owners, and so many others can grow their businesses and thrive. We cannot allow government to be an obstacle to government opportunity. We are going to bring back jobs and create more opportunities to prosper, maybe more than ever before in our country. Weve made tremendous strides over the last short period of time. This is -- I guess were four weeks into it. I think for four weeks Ive done a good job, wouldnt you say? (Laughter.) But again, I want to thank these great business leaders. Some of them are with us and the White House, and theyve had tremendous success -- Reed and Jared and so many others -- in business. And theyre helping us sort out whats going on, because really, for many years, even beyond -- long beyond Obama, President Obama -- I will say that its been disastrous for business. This is going to be a place for business to do well and to thrive.And so with the signing of this executive order, I would like to just congratulate everybody behind me. And, Andrew, Id like to thank you for initially getting the group together. MR. LIVERIS: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Really a fantastic job youve done. MR. LIVERIS: Thank you.(The executive order is signed.)THE PRESIDENT: Should I give this pen to Andrew? Dow Chemical. (Laughter.) I think maybe, right? (Applause.) MR LIVERIS: Thank you. THE PRESIDENT: That means a lot of jobs. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.END12:12 P.M. EST",20821.76,11.43999999999869,5845.31,9.800000000000182,2367.34,3.5300000000002
207,2017-02-24,Remarks by President Trump at the Conservative Political Action Conference ,"Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center10:23 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, everybody. So great to be with you. Thank you. (Applause.)Great to be back at CPAC. (Applause.) The place I have really --AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!THE PRESIDENT: I love this place. Love you people. (Applause.) So thank you. Thank you very much.First of all, I want to thank Matt Schlapp, and his very, very incredible wife and boss, Mercedes, who have been fantastic friends and supporters, and so great. When I watch them on television defending me, nobody has a chance. So, I want to thank Matt and Mercedes. And when Matt called and asked, I said, absolutely, I'll be there with you. I mean, the real reason I said it -- I didnt want him to go against me because that one you cant beat. So I said, absolutely. And it really is an honor to be here.I wouldn't miss a chance to talk to my friends. These are my friends. (Applause.) And well see you again next year and the year after that, and Ill be doing this with CPAC whenever I can, and Ill make sure that were here a lot.You know, if you remember, my first major speech -- sit down, everybody. Come on. (Applause.) You know, the dishonest media, theyll say he didnt get a standing ovation. You know why? No, you know why? Because everybody stood and nobody sat, so they will say he never got a standing ovation, right? (Applause.) They are the worst.AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA! (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: So -- sit down. (Laughter.) Donald Trump did not get a standing ovation. They leave out the part, they never sat down. They leave that out. So I just want to thank -- but you know, my first major speech was at CPAC. And probably five or six years ago -- first major political speech. And you were there.And it was -- I loved it. I love the people. I love the commotion. And then they did these polls where I went through the roof, and I wasnt even running, right? But it gave me an idea, and I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was happening in the country, and I said, lets go do it. So it was very exciting. I walked the stage on CPAC. Ill never forget it, really. I had very little notes, and even less preparation. So when you have practically no notes and no preparation, and then you leave and everybody was thrilled, I said, I think I like this business.I would have come last year, but I was worried that I would be, at that time, too controversial. We wanted border security. We wanted very, very strong military. We wanted all of the things that were going to get, and people consider that controversial. But you didnt consider it controversial. (Applause.)So Ive been with CPAC for a long time. All of these years, we've been together. And now you finally have a president. Finally. Took you a long time. Took you a long time. (Applause.)And its patriots like you that made it happen, believe me -- believe me. You did it because you love your country, because you want a better future for your children, and because you want to make America great again. (Applause.)The media didn't think we would win. AUDIENCE MEMBER: They knew. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: The pundits -- youre right. They had an idea. The pundits didn't think we would win. The consultants that suck up all that money. Oh, they suck it up, theyre so good. (Laughter.) Theyre not good at politics, but theyre really good at sucking up peoples money. Especially my opponents, because I kept them down to a minimum.THE PRESIDENT: But the consultants didnt think we would win. But they all underestimated the power of the people -- you. And the people proved them totally wrong. Never -- and this is so true, and this is whats been happening -- never underestimate the people. Never. I dont think it will ever happen again.And I want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. Its fake -- phony, fake. (Applause.) A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people -- and they are. They are the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources, they just make them up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said nine people have confirmed. There are no nine people. I dont believe there was one or two people. Nine people. And I said, give me a break. Because I know the people. I know who they talked to. There were no nine people. But they say, nine people, and somebody reads it and they think, oh, nine people. They have nine sources. They make up sources.They are very dishonest people. In fact, in covering my comments, the dishonest media did not explain that I called the fake news the enemy of the people -- the fake news. They dropped off the word fake. And all of the sudden, the story became, the media is the enemy. They take the word fake out, and now Im saying, oh, no, this is no good. But thats the way they are. So Im not against the media. Im not against the press. I dont mind bad stories if I deserve them. And I tell you, I love good stories, but we wont -- (laughter) -- I dont get too many of them.But I am only against the fake news media or press -- fake, fake. They have to leave that word. I'm against the people that make up stories and make up sources. They shouldnt be allowed to use sources unless they use somebodys name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out. (Applause.) A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being. Let them say it to my face. (Applause.) Let there be no more sources. And remember this -- and in not all in all cases. I mean, I had a story written yesterday about me in Reuters by a very honorable man. It was a very fair story. There are some great reporters around. Theyre talented, theyre honest as the day is long. Theyre great. But there are some terrible, dishonest people, and they do a tremendous disservice to our country and to our people. A tremendous disservice. They are very dishonest people, and they shouldnt use sources. They should put the name of the person. You will see stories dry up like youve never seen before.So you have no idea how bad it is, because if you are not part of the story -- and I put myself in your position sometimes, because many of you, youre not part of the story, and if youre not part of the story, then you sort of know. If you are part of the story, you know what theyre saying is true or not. So when they make it up, and they make up something else, and you saw that before the election -- polls, polls. The polls. They come out with these polls, and everybody was so surprised. Actually, a couple of polls got it right. I must say, Los Angeles Times did a great job. Shocking, because -- you know. They did a great job. (Applause.) And we had a couple of others that were right.But generally speaking, I mean, I can tell you the network. Somebody said a poll came out. And I say, what network is it? And theyll say, a certain -- lets not even mention names right? Should we?Well, you have a lot of them. Look, the Clinton new network is one. (Applause.) Totally. Take a look. Honestly. Take a look at their polls over the last two years. Now, you would think they would fire the pollster, right? After years and years of getting battered. But I dont -- I mean, who knows, maybe theyre just bad at polling. Or maybe theyre not legit. But its one or the other. Look at how inaccurate -- look at CBS, look at ABC also. Look at NBC. Take a look at some of these polls. Theyre so bad, so inaccurate. And what that does is it creates a false narrative. It creates like this narrative thats just like were not going to win, and people say, ""Oh, I love Trump, but you know Im not feeling great today. He cant win. So I wont go and vote. I wont go and vote."" It creates a whole false deal and we have to fight it folks. We have to fight it. Theyre very smart, theyre very cunning, and theyre very dishonest.So just to conclude -- I mean, its a very sensitive topic, and they get upset when we expose their false stories. They say that we can't criticize their dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment. You know, they always bring up the First Amendment. (Laughter.) And I love the First Amendment. Nobody loves it better than me. Nobody. (Applause.) I mean, who uses it more than I do?But the First Amendment gives all of us -- it gives it to me, it gives it to you, it gives all Americans -- the right to speak our minds freely. It gives you the right and me the right to criticize fake news, and criticize it strongly. (Applause.) And many of these groups are part of the large media corporations that have their own agenda, and its not your agenda, and its not the countrys agenda. Its their own agenda. They have a professional obligation as members of the press to report honestly. But as you saw throughout the entire campaign, and even now, the fake news doesnt tell the truth. Doesnt tell the truth.So just in finishing, I say it doesnt represent the people. It never will represent the people. And were going to do something about it, because we have to go out and we have to speak our minds, and we have to be honest. Our victory was a win like nobody has ever seen before. (Applause.) And Im here fighting for you, and I will continue to fight for you. The victory and the win were something that really was dedicated to a country and people that believe in freedom, security, and the rule of law. (Applause.) Our victory was a victory and a win for conservative values. (Applause.) And our victory was a win for everyone who believes its time to stand up for America, to stand up for the American worker, and to stand up for the American flag. (Applause.) Yeah, there we should stand up. Come on. (Applause.) There we should stand up. Okay. (Applause.)And, by the way, we love our flag. By the way, you folks are in here, the place is packed -- there are lines that go back six blocks. And I tell you that because you wont read about it, okay? (Laughter.) But there are lines that go back six blocks. There is such love in this country for everything we stand for. You saw that on Election Day. (Applause.) And youre going to see it more and more. (Applause.) So were all part of this very historic movement, a movement the likes of which, actually, the world has never seen before. Theres never been anything like this. Theres been some movements, but theres never been anything like this. Theres been some movements that petered out, like Bernie -- petered out. (Laughter.) But it was a little rigged against him -- superdelegate, superdelegate. She had so many delegates before the thing even started. I actually said to my people, how does that happen? (Laughter.) Not that Im a fan of Bernie, but a lot of Bernie people voted for Trump. You know why? Because hes right on one issue: Trade. He was right about trade.Our country is being absolutely devastated with bad trade deals. So he was right about that, but weve got a lot of Bernie support. So actually, I like Bernie, okay? I like Bernie. (Applause.) But Im here today to tell you what this movement means for the future of the Republican Party and for the future of America. First, we need to define what this great, great unprecedented movement is, and what it actually represents. The core conviction of our movement is that we are a nation that put and will put its own citizens first. (Applause.) For too long weve traded away our jobs to other countries -- so terrible. Weve defended other nations borders while leaving ours wide open; anybody can come in. AUDIENCE MEMBER: A wall!THE PRESIDENT: Oh, were going to build the wall, dont worry about it. Were building the wall. Were building the wall. In fact, its going to start soon, way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule. (Applause.) Way, way, way ahead of schedule. Its going to start very soon. General Kelly, by the way, has done a fantastic job. Fantastic job hes done. (Applause.) And remember, we are getting the bad ones out. These are bad dudes. Were getting the bad ones out, okay? Were getting the bad -- if you watch these people its like, oh, gee, thats so sad. Were getting bad people out of this country, people that shouldnt be -- whether its drugs or murder or other things. Were getting bad ones out. Those are the ones that go first, and I said it from day one. Basically all Ive done is keep my promise. (Applause.) Weve spent trillions of dollars overseas while allowing our own infrastructure to fall into total disrepair and decay. In the Middle East, weve spent as of four weeks ago $6 trillion. Think of it. And, by the way, the Middle East is in what -- I mean, its not even close -- its in much worse shape than it was 15 years ago. If our Presidents would have gone to the beach for 15 years, we would be in much better shape than we are right now, that I can tell you. (Applause.) Yeah, a hell of a lot better. We could have rebuilt our country three times with that money. This is the situation that I inherited. I inherited a mess, believe me. We also inherited a failed health care law that threatens our medical system with absolute and total catastrophe.Now, Ive been watching -- and nobody says it -- but Obamacare doesnt work, folks. I mean, I could say -- I could talk -- it doesnt work. And now people are starting to develop a little warm heart, but the people that youre watching, theyre not you. Theyre largely -- many of them are the side that lost. You know, they lost the election. Its like, how many elections do we have to have? They lost the election. (Laughter.) But I always say, Obamacare doesnt work. And these same people two years, and a year ago, were complaining about Obamacare. And the bottom line: Were changing it. Were going to make it much better. Were going to make it less expensive. Were going to make it much better. Obamacare covers very few people.And remember, deduct from the number all of the people that had great health care that they loved, that was taken away from them; was taken away from them. (Applause.) Millions of people were very happy with their health care. They had their doctor, they had their plan. Remember the lie -- 28 times. You can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan -- over and over and over again you heard it. So were going to repeal and replace Obamacare. (Applause.) And I tell Paul Ryan and all of the folks that were working with very hard -- Dr. Tom Price, very talented guy -- but I tell them from a purely political standpoint, the single-best thing we can do is nothing. Let it implode completely -- its already imploding. You see the carriers are all leaving. I mean, its a disaster.But two years dont do anything. The Democrats will come to us and beg for help. Theyll beg, and its their problem. But its not the right thing to do for the American people. Its not the right thing to do. (Applause.)We inherited a national debt that has doubled in eight years. Think of it -- $20 trillion. Its doubled. And we inherited a foreign policy marked by one disaster after another. We dont win anymore. When was the last time we won? Did we win a war? Do we win anything? Do we win anything? Were going to win. Were going to win big, folks. Were going to start winning again, believe me. Were going to win. (Applause.) AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!THE PRESIDENT: But were taking a firm, bold and decisive measure -- we have to -- to turn things around. The era of empty talk is over. Its over. (Applause.) Now is the time for action. So let me tell you about the actions that were taking right now to deliver on our promise to the American people, and on my promise to make America great again.Weve taken swift and strong action to secure the southern border of the United States and to begin the construction of great, great border wall. (Applause.) And with the help of our great border police, with the help of ICE, with the help of General Kelly and all of the people that are so passionate about this -- our Border Patrol, Ill tell you what they do. They came and endorsed me, ICE came and endorsed me. They never endorsed a presidential candidate before. They might not even be allowed to. (Laughter.) But they were disgusted with what they saw.And well stop it. Well stop the drugs from pouring into our nation and poisoning our youth. (Applause.) Pouring in, pouring in. We get the drugs, they get the money. We get the problems, they get the cash. No good, no good. Going to stop.By stopping the flow of illegal immigration, we will save countless tax dollars, and that's so important because the tax -- the dollars that we're losing are beyond anything that you can imagine. And the tax dollars that can be used to rebuild struggling American communities -- including our inner cities. (Applause.)We are also going to save countless American lives. As we speak today, immigration officers are finding the gang members, the drug dealers and the criminal aliens, and throwing them the hell out of our country. (Applause.) And we will not let them back in. They're not coming back in, folks. (Applause.) If they do, they're going to have bigger problems than they ever dreamt of.I'm also working with the Department of Justice to begin reducing violent crime. I mean, can you believe what's happening in Chicago, as an example? Two days ago, seven people were shot --AUDIENCE MEMBER: It's Iraq!THE PRESIDENT: -- and, I believe, killed. Seven people. Seven people. Chicago, a great American city. Seven people shot and killed. We will support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.) Thank you. And thank them. I've also followed through on my campaign promise and withdrawn America from the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- (applause) -- so that we can protect our economic freedom. And we are going to make trade deals, but we're going to do one-on-one, one-on-one. And if they misbehave, we terminate the deal. And then they'll come back, and we'll make a better deal. (Applause.) None of these big quagmire deals that are a disaster. Just take a look -- by the way, take a look at NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever made by any country having to do with economic development. It's economic undevelopment as far as our country is concerned.We're preparing to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. (Applause.) We're going to save Americans from this crisis, and give them the access to the quality healthcare they need and deserve.We have authorized the construction, one day, of the Keystone and Dakota Access pipelines. (Applause.) And issued a new rule. This took place while I was getting ready to sign. I said, who makes the pipes for the pipeline? Well, sir, it comes from all over the world, isn't that wonderful? I said, nope, it comes from the United States or we're not building one. (Applause.) American steel.  If they want a pipeline in the United States, they're going to use pipe that's made in the United States, do we agree? (Applause.)But can you imagine -- I told this story the other day -- can you imagine the gentleman -- never met him, don't even know the name of his company. I actually sort of know it, but I want to get it exactly correct. Big, big, powerful company. They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the pipeline -- same thing with the Dakota, different place. They got their approvals, everything, in the case of Dakota, then all of a sudden they couldn't connect it because they had people protesting that never showed up before.But with the Keystone -- so they spend hundreds of millions of dollars with bloodsucker consultants, you know, sucking the blood out of the company -- ""don't worry, I use them all my life; okay, don't worry, we're going to get it approved, I'm connected, I'm a lobbyist, don't worry."" Bottom line, Obama didn't sign it. Could be 42,000 jobs -- somewhere around there. A lot of jobs. Didn't sign it. But can you imagine -- he gave up. A year ago it was dead. Now he's doing nothing, calling his wife, ""Hello, darling, I'm a little bored, you know that pipeline?"" That has killed us, that has killed our company. Knock, knock. ""Mr. so-and-so, the Keystone pipeline, sir, out of nowhere, has just been approved."" (Applause.) Now, can you imagine the expression? And you know the sad part? The same bloodsucking consultants that hit him for all the money and failed? They're now going to go back to him and say, didn't we do a great job? We want more money, right, because that's the way the system works. A little bit off, but that's the way the system works.We're preparing bold action to lift the restrictions on American energy, including shale, oil, natural gas, and beautiful clean coal, and we're going to put our miners back to work. (Applause.) Miners are going back to work. (Applause.) Miners are going back to work, folks. Sorry to tell you that, but they're going back to work. We have begun a historic program to reduce the regulations that are crushing our economy -- crushing. And not only our economy, crushing our jobs, because companies can't hire. We're going to put the regulation industry out of work and out of business. (Applause.) And, by the way, I want regulation. I want to protect our environment. I want regulations for safety. I want all of the regulations that we need, and I want them to be so strong and so tough. But we don't need 75 percent of the repetitive, horrible regulations that hurt companies, hurt jobs, make us noncompetitive overseas with other companies from other countries. That, we don't need. But we're going to have regulations. It's going to be really strong and really good, and we're going to protect our environment, and we're going to protect the safety of our people and our workers. (Applause.)Another major promise is tax reform. We are going to massively lower taxes on the middle class, reduce taxes on American business, and make our tax code more simple and much more fair for everyone, including the people and the business. (Applause.)In anticipation of these and other changes, jobs are already starting to pour back into our country -- you see that. In fact, I think I did more than any other pre-President -- they say President-elect. President-elect is meeting with Ford, he's meeting with Chrysler, he's meeting with General Motors. I just wanted to save a little time. (Laughter.) Because Ford and Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Intel and so many others are now, because of the election result, making major investments in the United States, expanding production and hiring more workers. And they're going back to Michigan, and they're going back to Ohio, and they're going back to Pennsylvania, and they're going back to North Carolina, and to Florida. (Applause.)It's time for all Americans to get off of welfare and get back to work. You're going to love it! You're going to love it. You are going to love it. (Applause.)We're also putting in a massive budget request for our beloved military. (Applause.) And we will be substantially upgrading all of our military -- all of our military. Offensive, defensive, everything. Bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And hopefully, we'll never have to use it. But nobody is going to mess with us, folks. Nobody. (Applause.)It will be one of the greatest military buildups in American history. No one will dare to question -- as they have been, because we're very depleted, very, very depleted. Sequester. Sequester. Nobody will dare question our military might again. We believe in peace through strength, and that's what we will have. (Applause.) As part of my pledge to restore safety for the American people, I have also directed the defense community to develop a plan to totally obliterate ISIS. (Applause.) Working with our allies, we will eradicate this evil from the face of the Earth. (Applause.)At the same time, we fully understand that national security begins with border security. Foreign terrorists will not be able to strike America if they cannot get into our country. (Applause.) And by the way, take a look at what's happening in Europe, folks. Take a look at what's happening in Europe. I took a lot of heat on Sweden. (Laughter.) And then a day later, I said, has anybody reported what's going on? And it turned out that they didn't -- not too many of them did. (Laughter.) Take a look at what happened in Sweden. I love Sweden. Great country. Great people. I love Sweden. But they understand I'm right. The people over there understand I'm right. Take a look at what's happening in Sweden. Take a look at what's happening in Germany. Take a look at what's happened in France. Take a look at Nice and Paris. I have a friend -- he's a very, very substantial guy. He loves the City of Lights. He loves Paris. For years, every year, during the summer, he would go to Paris -- it was automatic -- with his wife and his family. I hadnt seen him in a while. And I said, Jim, let me ask you a question: Hows Paris doing? ""Paris? I dont go there anymore. Paris is no longer Paris."" That was four years -- four, five years -- hasnt gone there. He wouldnt miss it for anything. Now he doesnt even think in terms of going there. Take a look at whats happening to our world, folks, and we have to be smart. We have to be smart. We cant let it happen to us. (Applause.)So let me state this as clearly as I can: We are going to keep radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. (Applause.) We will not be deterred from this course, and in a matter of days, we will be taking brand new action to protect out people and keep America safe. You will see the action. (Applause.)I will never, ever apologize for protecting the safety and security of the American people. I wont do it. (Applause.) If it means I get bad press, if it means people speak badly of me, its okay. It doesnt bother me. The security of our people is number one -- is number one. (Applause.) Our administration is running with great efficiency, even though I still dont have my Cabinet approved. Nobody mentions that. Do you know I still have people out there waiting to be approved? And everyone knows they're going to be approved. Its just a delay, delay, delay. Its really sad. Its really sad. And these are great people. These are some great people. We still dont have our Cabinet. I assume were setting records for that. Thats the only thing good about it is were setting records. I love setting records. (Applause.) But I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats. I said, Democrats, please, approve our Cabinet and get smart on health care too, if you dont mind. (Applause.)But were taking meetings every day with top leaders in business, in science, and industry. Yesterday, I had 29 of the biggest business leaders in the world in my office -- Caterpillar tractor, Campbells Soup. We had everybody. We had everybody. I like Campbells Soup. (Laughter and applause.) We had everybody, and we came to a lot of very good conclusions, and a lot of those folks that are in that room are going to be building big, big massive new plants, and lots of jobs. And you know what? Theyre going to be building them in this country, not in some other country. (Applause.)Were meeting with unions, meeting with law enforcement, and were meeting with leaders from all around the world, where the White House doors used to be totally closed -- they were closed, folks. You dont realize that. They were closed. Theyre now wide open. And theyre open for people doing business for our country and putting people to work. (Applause.)And when they come into the White House, were translating these meetings into action. One by one, were checking off the promises we made to the people of the United States. One by one -- a lot of promises. And we will not stop until the job is done. We will reduce your taxes. We will cut your regulations. We will support our police. We will defend our flag. (Applause.) We will rebuild our military. We will take care of our great, great veterans. Were taking care of our veterans. (Applause.)We will fix our broken and embarrassing trade deals that are no good -- none of them. You wonder, where did the people come from that negotiated these deals? Where did they come from?AUDIENCE MEMBER: Government.THE PRESIDENT: Well, they came also from campaign contributions, I must be honest with you. Theyre not as stupid as you think. (Laughter.)We will cut wasteful spending. We will promote our values. We will rebuild our inner cities. We will bring back our jobs and our dreams. So true. (Applause.) So true.And, by the way, we will protect our Second Amendment. (Applause.) You know, Wayne and Chris are here from the NRA, and they didnt have that on the list. Its lucky I thought about it. (Laughter.) But we will indeed. And theyre great people. And by the way, they love our country. They love our country. The NRA has been a great supporter. They love our country.The forgotten men and women of America will be forgotten no longer. That is the heart of this new movement and the future of the Republican Party. People came to vote, and these people -- the media -- they said, where are they coming from? Whats going on here? These are hardworking, great, great Americans. These are unbelievable people who have not been treated fairly. Hillary called them deplorable. Theyre not deplorable.AUDIENCE: Booo -- lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!THE PRESIDENT: Who would have thought that a word was going to play so badly. Thats the problem in politics. One wrong word and its over. She also said irredeemable, but we wont mention that. The GOP will be, from now on, the party also of the American worker. (Applause.) You know, we havent been, as a group, given credit for this, but if you look at how much bigger our party has gotten during this cycle. During the early days when we had 17 people running -- the primaries -- millions and millions of people were joining. Now, I wont say it was because of me, but it was, okay. (Applause.)And we have an amazing, strong, powerful party that truly does want to see America be great again, and it will see it. And its going to see it a lot sooner than you think, believe me. A lot sooner than you think. (Applause.)We will not answer to donors or lobbyists or special interests, but we will serve the citizens of the United States of America, believe me. Global cooperation -- dealing with other countries, getting along with other countries -- is good. Its very important. But there is no such thing as a global anthem, a global currency, or a global flag. This is the United States of America that Im representing. Im not representing the globe. Im representing your country. (Applause.)AUDIENCE: USA! USA! USA!THE PRESIDENT: There is one allegiance that unites us all, and that is to America. America -- its the allegiance to America.No matter our background, or income, or geography, we are all citizens of this blessed land. And no matter our color, or the blood, the color of the blood we bleed, its the same red blood of great, great patriots. Remember. Great patriots. (Applause.)We all salute, with pride, the same American Flag. And we are equal -- totally equal -- in the eyes of Almighty God. Were equal. (Applause.) Thank you.And I want to thank, by the way, the evangelical community, the Christian community. (Applause.) Communities of faith -- rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers -- because the support for me was a record, as you know, not only in terms of numbers of people, but percentages of those numbers that voted for Trump. So I want to thank you folks. It was amazing -- an amazing outpouring, and I will not disappoint you. As long as we have faith in each other, and trust in God, then there is no goal, at all, beyond our reach. There is no dream too large, no task too great. We are Americans, and the future belongs to us. The future belongs to all of you. (Applause.) And America is coming about, and its coming back, and its roaring and you can hear it. Its going to be bigger and better. It is going to be. It is going to be. Remember. And its roaring. Its going to be bigger, and better, and stronger than ever before. (Applause.)I want to thank you. And Matt and Mercedes, I want to thank the two of you, and all of the supporters that I have. I see them. Theyre all over the place. You are really great people. I want to thank you.And I want to say to you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. Thank you, folks. Thank you. (Applause.)END11:04 A.M.

208,2017-02-24,ICYMI: President Trump's Focus Brings Renewed Optimism to America's Manufacturers,"Trump's Focus Brings Renewed Optimism To America's ManufacturersWashington ExaminerBy Jay TimmonsConsumer confidence registered a 15-year high after the election. The stock market is shattering records. Job numbers are improving. These data points are evidence that the economic ""spirit of optimism"" about which President Trump has spoken frequently in recent days is real.As the National Association of Manufacturers kicks off its annual ""State of Manufacturing"" tour this week, we can declare that manufacturers in America are optimistic about the future because we now have a true advocate, partner and ally in the White House.But there is a new focus with this administration. From the very first day of business, Trump opened up the White House for listening sessions for manufacturers to share ideas and concerns with him and his staff. And the president personally visited Boeing  a major manufacturing exporter  to celebrate the unveiling of its impressive new Dreamliner.Recently, Intels CEO stood in the Oval Office to announce the company's plan to invest $7 billion in a U.S. factory that will create 10,000 American jobs. Lockheed-Martin pledged to add 1,800 jobs. Numerous automakers have announced major investments in U.S. facilities. And, similarly, other global companies are making major investments in the future of manufacturing in the United States. Take for example, Bayer's $8 billion acquisition of Monsanto. This is the largest deal ever in the agriculture industry and will keep the headquarters in St. Louis, Mo.To connect more people with solid manufacturing careers, we need to see more change from Washington. Trump pledged to slash bureaucratic red tape, cut taxes for our workers and businesses, and negotiate strong trade deals. He vowed to unleash American energy. Manufacturers look forward to Trump delivering on his promises, just as he has already delivered on promises to prioritize major infrastructure projects and reduce the burden of government regulations.Indeed, Trump is off to a great start, and we are excited about the pro-growth tax reform, healthcare and infrastructure investment plans that are expected to come in the near future.Manufacturers will continue engaging with the administration to craft policies that put Americans back to work. The only way to lift everyone up and leave no one behind is with a strong and growing manufacturing jobs base. We are proud to work alongside President Trump  and any leader who believes in manufacturing's promise  to make manufacturing and our nation greater than ever before.Jay Timmons is president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers.Read the entire article here.",20821.76,11.43999999999869,5845.31,9.800000000000182,2367.34,3.5300000000002

210,2017-02-24,President Donald J. Trump Cuts Through More Red Tape,"Since day one, President Donald J. Trump has been cutting regulatory red tape in Washington in order to help the American people and increase efficiency. Costly regulations and job-stifling bureaucratic red tape have held back the American economy for far too long, and the President is committed to addressing this challenge directly.On Friday, President Trump signed an Executive Order aimed at reforming Government regulation by requiring every agency to establish a Regulatory Reform Task Force to eliminate red tape.Each Regulatory Reform Task Force will evaluate existing regulations and identify candidatesfor repeal or modification.Each agencys Task Force will focus on eliminating costly and unnecessary regulations.To hold the Task Forces accountable, each agency will measure and report progress in achieving the Presidents directives.This action will address the unchecked regulations from past administrations that imposed a steep cost on the American economy. The regulations from the last Administration cost American taxpayers $873 billion. The Obama Administration alone finalized more than 3,000 regulations.President Trump has been steadfast in his commitment to reducing the regulatory burden on everyday Americans; their pocketbooks, and their businesses. This new Executive Order builds on the Presidents Actions, which include:Requiring that for every new Federal regulation, two existing regulations be eliminated.An Executive Order instructing Federal agencies to minimize the burden of the Affordable Care Act on Americans while he works to repeal and replace the law.House Joint Resolution 38, to prevent the burdensome Stream Protection Rule from causing further harm to the coal industry.House Joint Resolution 41, to eliminate a costly regulation that threatened to put American mining and energy companies and their employees at an unfair disadvantage.Directing the Secretary of Commerce to streamline Federal permitting processes for domestic manufacturers.An Executive Order expediting the environmental review and approval processes for domestic infrastructure projects.Directing the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct a full review of the burdensome regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Act.Ordering the re-examination of the Department of Labors ""fiduciary rule,"" to make certain that it does not harm Americans as they save for retirement.",20821.76,11.43999999999869,5845.31,9.800000000000182,2367.34,3.5300000000002

212,2017-02-27,Remarks by President Trump in Listening Session with Health Insurance Company CEOs,"Roosevelt Room11:03 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: You are the big ones. You are the biggest of the big, right? (Laughter.) Thats very impressive. Thank you for being here. We just had a great meeting with the governors on the horrible effects that Obamacare is having. Were going to change it and straighten it out, and make -- we have a plan thats going to be, I think, fantastic. It will be released fairly soon. Well be talking about it tomorrow night during the speech. But I think its going to be something special, and well talk it about right here. I think well get you on, and I think youre going to like what you hear.Again, thank you for being here. I want to thank also Secretary Tom Price whos with us, and whos doing a phenomenal job on a very complex subject, the subject of healthcare. Hes an advocate for the patients. Tom is all about the patients. Thats what he wants. He wants to have a great healthcare system.Obamacare has been a disaster, and its only getting worse. Last year alone, Obamacare premiums increased by double digits. Since it has gone into effect, premiums are up by almost 100 percent in many areas. And I think that this year its going to be really the year that Ive always predicted -- 17 is going to be a catastrophic year for Obamacare, for payments. And you just take a look at whats happening in various states like Arizona -- I believe it was up 116 percent; its going to be worse this year.Obamacare forced providers to limit the plan options they offered to patients and caused them to drive prices way up. Now, a third of United States counties are down to one insurer, and the insurers are fleeing. You people know that better than anybody.Since Obamacare went into effect, nearly half of the insurers are stopped and have stopped from participating in the Obamacare exchanges. It has gotten so bad that nearly 20 million Americans have chosen to pay the penalty, or received an exemption rather than buy insurance. Thats something that nobody has ever heard of or thought could happen, and theyre actually doing that rather than being forced to buy insurance. We must work together to save Americans from Obamacare -- you people know that, and everyone knows that at this point -- to create more competition and to bring down the prices substantially. The chaos that Obamacare has created, and for which congressional Democrats -- and you see that -- are alone and responsible for requires swift action. I actually told the Republicans that if we did nothing, just do nothing for a two-year period, let Obamacare totally implode -- which its doing right now anyway -- that would be, from a political standpoint, the best thing we could do is to let it implode, and then people will come begging -- the Democrats will come begging to do something to help them out of the jam.Once we start doing it, we sort of inherit the problem, we take over the problem, it becomes ours. But its the right thing to do for the American people. I think allowing this to go on -- this disaster to go on -- is a mistake. So Im asking Secretary Price to work with you to stabilize the insurance markets and to ensure a smooth transition to the new plan. And the new plan will be a great plan for the patients, for the people, and hopefully for the companies. It's going to be a very competitive plan. And costs will come down, and I think the healthcare will go up very, very substantially. I think people are going to like it a lot.Weve taken the best of everything we can take. Its our hope that Democrats will stop the obstruction and resistance. And thats what they have -- in fact, they have a sign, ""resist, resist."" They want to resist everything, including Cabinet members. I have many Cabinet members that havent been approved yet, people that are extraordinary -- all of whom are going to be approved, but they just take forever. Its called obstruct and resist. Hope I didnt give them a new phrase, because their real phrase is resist. I think I just gave them another word. I shouldnt have done that. Im good at branding. (Laughter.) Youre going to see them now come out, obstruct and resist. All right, well, at least I can take credit for it. And they worked with us, and we are going to hopefully work with the Democrats, because ultimately were all people that love this country and we want to do the right thing, including reforms like expanded healthcare savings accounts, state flexibility, and the ability to purchase across state lines. The state lines are so important for competition. Everybody has wanted to do it for years. Whats not to do? So thats going to be very important.I want to thank you all for being here. I want to know and I want you to know that its an honor to do business with you. Its a great honor to have you in the White House. And we look forward to providing healthcare that is that is extraordinary -- better than any other country anywhere in the world. And we can do that. We have the talent, we have the capacity, and we have the people.So well work on that together. And maybe before the press leaves, you can just introduce yourself and your company, and the public will get to see what you're about. And then if things arent working out, Im blaming you anyway. (Laughter.)So well start with Brad.MR. WILSON: Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the opportunity to be here.

We look forward to working with you, Vice President Pence, Secretary Price in making sure that we have a sustainable program for years to come. So thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. And the market, as you know, and we talk about stabilizing the market -- the market is disastrous. Its going to absolutely implode. That's why we're meeting today. And I think we're going to come up with something where not only will the market be great, but the people are going to be taken care of. So we will work that out I think quite easily, actually.Thank you very much. Thank you, everybody.END11:12 A.M. EST",20837.44,15.680000000000291,5861.9,16.589999999999236,2369.75,2.4099999999998545

214,2017-02-27,Remarks by President Trump in Meeting with the National Governors Association,"State Dining Room9:45 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) That is pretty good, I'll tell you. Coming from governors, I can't really -- I can't even believe it. That's so impressive. And I very much appreciate you being here. And thank you to Vice President Pence. He has been so wonderful to work with. He's a real talent, a real guy. And he is central casting, do we agree? Central casting. He's been great. (Applause.) Good morning, everybody, and welcome back to the White House. The First Lady and I were very, very happy last night to host you. We saw some real talent, military talent, musicians who were fantastic. And everybody enjoyed it. (Applause.) Im very proud to have so many former governors in my Cabinet. Vice President Pence, as you know, big governor from a very great state -- I state I like very much -- Indiana. Nikki Haley at the U.N. -- is Nikki here someplace? I think so -- yes. We have Rick Perry -- is going before. We're trying to get people approved, we can't get them out. But Rick is going to do a fantastic job. Sonny Purdue will be joining the Cabinet very soon. Terry Branstad will be our ambassador to China. And an interesting story on Terry -- every time I spoke in Iowa, he'd say, please dont say anything bad about China. (Laughter.) I said, what do you mean? What do you mean? He said, I like China and we do a lot of business with China. ""And really, just dont"" -- and I said, ""hmm."" So when it came down to picking an ambassador, I called him up, I said, you like China. And I can tell you, China is very, very happy with our choice. So we made everybody happy. (Applause.) Right? These governors -- thank you. And thank you, Terry.These governors have been bold reformers, and their success shows why we need to make states the laboratories of democracy once again. Many of you have shared past frustrations with waiting for permission from the federal government and agencies -- and I understand that, and I've had many people tell me about it, and it's been catastrophic for some of your states. You know your citizens and you know they want things done. But they dont get things done and it's not your fault. Sometimes it's your fault, but they understand that. But sometimes it's not your fault. We're going to speed it up. Because that's not how a partnership is supposed to work. The government should not stand in your way in delivering needed reforms and services -- and it won't. We're going to move very, very quickly, environmentally, with Scott and so many others that are involved in the process of regulation. We are going to be cutting -- we're going to be doing the right thing. We're going to be protecting people environmentally and safety-wise, but we're going to be moving it quickly, very quickly. (Applause.) And speaking of that, I know many of you -- and I've spoken to some of you last night about it -- have many projects that are -- I mean, just literally tied up because of environmental concerns, and it's been in for years and years and years the project your state wants, great for employment -- everybody wants them -- and they couldnt get them out of environmental protection. And we will get them out. Now, that doesnt mean theyre going to be approved, but they'll be rejected quickly one way or the other. They'll be either rejected quickly or they're going to get approved. I would say most will be approved, but you're going to know you're not going to wait nine years or eleven years -- some of the horror stories that I've heard.Under my administration, we're going to have a true partnership of collaboration and cooperation. We will get to the answers and we will get them quickly, and the flexibility you need to implement the reforms that you are going to have in order to make decision-making proper and decision-making fast. So we're going to do both those things -- proper and fast. One of the most important responsibilities for the federal government is the budget of the United States. My first budget will be submitted to the Congress next month. This budget will be a public safety and national security budget, very much based on those two with plenty of other things, but very strong. And it will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it. (Applause.)  And you'll be hearing about that tomorrow night in great detail. This is a landmark event, a message to the world, in these dangerous times, of American strength, security and resolve. We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they need to deter war, and when called upon to fight in our name only do one thing: Win. We have to win. We have to start winning wars again. I have to say, when I was young, in high school and college, everybody used to say ""we havent lost a war"" -- we never lost a war -- you remember. Some of you were right there with me, and you remember we never lost a war. America never lost. And now we never win a war. We never win. And we dont fight to win. We dont fight to win. So we either got to win, or dont fight it at all. But where we are -- 17 years -- almost 17 years of fighting in the Middle East. I saw a chart the other day -- as of about a month ago, $6 trillion we've spent in the Middle East -- $6 trillion. And I want to tell you, that's just unacceptable. And we're nowhere. Actually, if you think about it, we're less than nowhere. The Middle East is far worse than it was 16, 17 years ago. There's not even a contest. So we've spent $6 trillion. We have a hornet's nest. It's a mess like you've never seen before. We're nowhere. So we're going to straighten it out. This defense spending increase will be offset and paid for by finding greater savings and efficiencies across the federal government. Were going to do more with less. I got involved in an airplane contract, I got involved in some other contracts, and we cut the hell out of the prices. I mean, we saved a lot of money, tremendous amount of money, beyond anything that the generals that were involved -- they said theyd never seen anything like this before.On one plane, on a small order of one plane, I saved $725 million. And I would say I devoted about, if I added it up, all those calls, probably about an hour. So I think that might be my highest and best use. (Laughter.) Because if we can do that, our budget will be -- might be my highest and best. (Applause.) And there are many other places; its all the same. And in one way, that's a good thing because we have an answer. And David is going to do a fantastic job at the VA. I see David is sitting there, shaking his head. Stand up, David. (Applause.) So we can't get our people through Cabinet, but he went through -- was it 95 to nothing?SECRETARY SHULKIN: A hundred to zero. THE PRESIDENT: How the hell did you do that? (Laughter.) Boy, oh boy. He must be good. You were the one. One hundred to zero, wow. Chose you -- hey, we can do it. But we do -- we have still quite a few Cabinet members, and they're just in limbo waiting and waiting. Its like obstruction. Its obstruction. But eventually we'll get them, and they'll put their people in, and well get those agencies, et cetera, to work.Were going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable to the people. We can do so much more with the money we spend. With $20 trillion in debt -- can you imagine that -- the government must learn to tighten its belt, something families all across the country have had to learn to do, unfortunately. But they've had to learn to do it, and theyve done it well. My budget increases spending, and the increase in all spending, for federal law enforcement also. And activities having to do with law enforcement will be substantially increased. And we will fight violent crime. If you look at whats happening in our cities, you look at whats happening in Chicago, whats going on in Chicago -- we will fight violent crime, and we will win. And well win that one fairly quickly. Once we give the local police, the local law enforcement the right to go in and fight it, and we back them monetarily and also otherwise, were going to win that one. We're going to win it fairly quickly, I believe.My budget also puts America first by keeping tax dollars in America to help veterans and first responders. So important. This budget follows through on my promise to focus on keeping Americans safe, keeping out terrorists, keeping out criminals, and putting violent offenders behind bars, or removing them from our country altogether. And I must say that weve been treated very well -- very, very well -- on the job that General Kelly has done at the border. Its tough, its strong. I was talking last night to Terry McAuliffe, and he said, you have to mention this -- because he met with -- where is Terry? Hes around here someplace. Terry -- he met with General Kelly, and I think I can say you were impressed with General Kelly. And he said, you have to get the point out that theyre removing the bad ones. And thats where our focus is -- its the bad ones. Were getting some very, very bad players out of this country -- drug lords, gang members, heads of gangs, killers, murderers -- were getting them out. Thats what were focused on. The press isnt covering that, unfortunately, but its something that is very important. Were getting the bad ones out. And thats always where I said I was going to start. I was going to start with these bad players. And they are bad. They are rough and tough, and were getting them the hell out of our country, and were bringing them to where they started out. Let their country do what they have to do with them.So the budget, which is going to be a very big part of tomorrow nights speech, its going to be I think a budget of great rationality. But its going to have to do with military, safety, economic development, and things such as that. Great detail tomorrow night.Were also going to do whatever we can to restore the authority of the states when that is the appropriate thing to do. Were going to give you back a lot of the powers that have been taken away from states and great people and great governors. And you can control it better than the federal government because youre right on top of it. You have something thats controllable. So I think thats going to be very important. You see that already taking effect. We have to let the states compete and to see who has the best solutions. They know the best how to spend their dollars and how to take care of the people within each state. And the states are different, and people are different. So the governors are going to have a lot more decision-making ability than they have right now.All states will benefit from our economic agenda. We will reduce taxes very, very substantially, and simplify the tax code. Were also going to make taxes between countries much more fair. Were one of the only countries in the world that people can sell their product into us and have no tax, no nothing, and they get rich. And yet if you want to do business with them, youll have taxes, Ive seen, as high as 100 percent. So they sell into us, no problem; we sell into them -- because we dont sell them because the tax is so high that they dont want us to sell into them. So I know thats always been a point of contention, but to me its just fair. Its just fair. Its reciprocal. Its fair. And so were going to be doing a lot of work on that, and thats becoming a very, very important factor -- fairness. Because I believe in free trade. I want so much trade -- somebody said, oh, maybe hes a total nationalist -- which I am, in a true sense -- but I want trade. I want great trade between countries. But the word free is very deceiving, because its good for them, its not good for us. I want fair trade. And if were going to be taxed, they should be taxed at the same amount, the other countries. And one of two things is going to happen: Were going to make a lot of money or the other country is going to get rid of its tax. And thats good, too, because now the product, like Harley-Davidson -- I was talking to them -- the product will now flow into other countries where right now they cant do it.So were going to make it easier for states to invest in infrastructure, and I'm going to have a big statement tomorrow night on infrastructure. We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, and we have potholes all over our highways and our roads. I have a friend who is in the trucking business. He said, my trucks are destroyed going from New York to Los Angeles. Theyre destroyed. He said, Im not going to get the good trucks. He always prided himself on buying the best equipment. He said, the roads are so bad that, by the time we make the journey from New York to Los Angeles or back, he said the equipment is just beat to hell. I said, when has it been like that before? He said, its never -- hes been in the business for 40 years -- he said its never been like that. Forty years -- never been like that. So were going to take care of that. Infrastructure -- were going to start spending on infrastructure big. And it's not like we have a choice. Its not like, oh, gee, lets hold it off. Our highways, our bridges are unsafe. Our tunnels -- I mean, we have tunnels in New York where the tiles are on the ceiling, and you see many tiles missing. And you wonder, you know, youre driving at 40 miles an hour, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel. Take a look at the Lincoln Tunnel and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, and youre driving, and you see all this loose material thats heavy. And it was made many years ago, so its heavy. Today, its light. It used to be better. The problem is, you got to hold it up. And I say to myself -- every time I drive through, I say, I wonder how many people are hurt or injured when they are driving at 40, 50 miles an hour through a tunnel, and the tile falls off. And there are so many missing tiles and such loose concrete. So we have to fix our infrastructure. Its not like we have a choice. We have no choice, and were going to do it, and it also happens to mean jobs, which is a good thing. Were going to repeal and replace Obamacare, and get states the flexibility that they need to make the end result really, really good for them. A very complicated issue. We have Tom Price, just got confirmed -- sitting here. (Applause.) Stand up, Tom. And I spent a lot of time with Governor Walker and Governor Rick Scott the other day -- we were talking about it. Theyre really very expert on the subject, and I want to thank them. They spent a lot of time with me. Governor Christie who's here someplace. Where's Chris? Governor Christie, thank you. And so we have a lot of talent and a lot of expertise here, I will tell you. And we have come up with a solution thats really, really, I think, very good. Now, I have to tell you, its an unbelievably complex subject. Nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated. And statutorily and for budget purposes, as you know, we have to do healthcare before we do the tax cut. The tax cut is going to be major, its going to be simple, and the whole tax plan is wonderful. But I cant do it until we do healthcare because we have to know what the healthcare is going to cost. And, statutorily, thats the way it is. So for those people that say, oh, gee, I wish we could do the tax first -- it just doesnt work that way. I would like to do that first. Its actually -- tax cutting has never been that easy, but its a tiny, little ant compared to what were talking about with Obamacare. And you have to remember -- and I say this to Democrats in the room -- of which we have many -- Obamacare has failed. If you go to Minnesota, where they had a 66-percent increase, and the governor of Minnesota, who is with us today, said, Obamacare -- the Affordable Care Act -- is no longer affordable -- something to that effect. I think that might be it exactly. But the Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. Obamacare has failed. I say to the Republicans, if you really want to do politically something good, dont do anything. Sit back for a period of two years, because 17 is going to be a disaster -- a disaster -- for Obamacare if we dont do something. Let it be a disaster because we can blame that on the Dems that are in our room, and we can blame that on the Democrats and President Obama. Let it implode, and then let it implode in 18 even worse. Dont do anything, and they will come begging for us to do something. But thats not the fair thing to do for the people. Its not the fair thing. Politically, I think it would be a great solution, because as soon as we touch it, if we do the most minute thing -- just a tiny, little change -- whats going to happen? Theyre going to say, its the Republicans problem. Thats the way it is. But we have to do whats right because Obamacare is a failed disaster. And its interesting, its sort of like, when you see -- you see it with politicians, you see it with President Obama -- when you know he's getting out of office and the clock is ticking, and he's not going to be there, his approval rating goes way up, even though, you know, not that active in the last period of time. The approval rating goes up. Thats not him; that's like almost everybody. I see it happening with Obamacare. People hate it, but now they see that the end is coming, and they're saying, oh, maybe we love it. Theres nothing to love. Its a disaster, folks, okay? So you have to remember that.And, very importantly, we are going to work to restore local control to our nations education system. Betsy is here someplace, and she is going to be, I think, fantastic. (Applause.) I think she's going to be fantastic. Stand up, Betsy. Betsy feels so strongly, and she has had such support from so many people. You know, you dont see that too much because you see the anti, you never see the positive. But I can tell you, Ive had so many calls while she was going through that horrible process. That was a tough, tough, nasty process. And she hung in, she was as strong as you get. But so many people were calling Betsy, saying you will do such a fantastic job once you get it.Its like sometimes I'd say, its much tougher to get into Harvard than it is to stay there. Does that make sense? Its tougher to get into the Wharton School of Finance -- you cant get in. But if you get in, its fine, you get through, right? I think youre going to do a fantastic job, and were very proud of you. And you took a lot of heat, but youre going to do great. So she wants to bring decision-making powers back to parents, back to the families and back to the states, where they can really control education. And just finally, Im looking forward to working with you on these projects and so much more. Were going to do these projects and so many more. And I thank you all again for being here. Its going to be a really productive discussion -- so productive that Im going to ask the press to start leaving because I wouldnt want them to see any great, productive session. (Laughter.) But they'll be seeing it and hearing about it. Again, thank you very much all for being at the White House. Well do this many times. I want the opinions of the governors of the states of the United States. So I want to just thank you all for being here, and lets take some questions, okay? (Applause.) Thank you.END10:05 A.M.

217,2017-02-27,ICYMI: President Trump Seeks to Outdo Obama in Backing Black Colleges,"Trump Seeks To Outdo Obama In Backing Black Colleges McClatchyBy Anita Kumar and William DouglasPresident Donald Trump is expected to provide historically black colleges and universities a long-awaited boost as he looks to outdo his predecessors  including the nations first African-American president  on a surprising issue.Trump will sign an executive order as early as Monday, when the schools presidents arrive in Washington for a visit. Its expected to significantly strengthen the office that pushes the federal government to do business with the colleges by moving it to the White HouseIt would be truly, truly historic, said Leonard Haynes, a longtime educator who ran the office and is helping to write the executive order. Its part of a long time dream...none of (the other presidents) had the courage to do it.Though African-Americans overwhelmingly support Democrats at the polls, many education experts credit Republican leaders for helping to improve HBCUs, the common shorthand for historically black schools.Some black college administrators say they were disappointed in President Barack Obama for not making the schools a priority and, in some cases, harming their financial health and contributing to declining enrollment with the changes he made to loan programs.The president has a strong commitment to them and understands over the last eight years they've been woefully neglected, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said. And I think he wants to really show a commitment. ... And so youll see, I think, not just a push this month, but in his budget and going forward.During the transition and into the start of his presidency, Trumps advisers met with HBCU officials as they considered how to make good on Trumps New Deal For Black America, which he unveiled at a speech in Charlotte, N.C. that alluded to black colleges.Those meetings included Omarosa Manigault, a graduate of Central State University in Ohio and Washingtons Howard University, both HBCUs. She gained fame in the first season of The Apprentice and now serves as communications director for the Office of Public Liaison in the White House.Some are pushing him to commit to a goal that HBCUs be awarded 5 percent of total federal grant, internship and cooperative agreement funding; and 10 percent of total federal contract funding awarded to colleges and universities, which would nearly double federal support to HBCUs. They also hope he will boost funding in his budget to be released mid-March.The executive order will coincide with the visit of about 90 presidents of historically black colleges and universities, who will be in Washington for a daylong conference. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. are scheduled to attend.Read the entire article here.",20837.44,15.680000000000291,5861.9,16.589999999999236,2369.75,2.4099999999998545
218,2017-02-27,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 2/27/2017, #17","James S. Brady Briefing Room1:43 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Wow, that's a crowd. I hope everyone had a great weekend. Good afternoon. Before I begin, I wanted to introduce the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to talk to you a bit about the President's budget. When Director Mulvaney is finished, we will allow him to take a few questions and then resume the briefing and all the fun that goes with it.So without any further ado, Director Mulvaney.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks very much. I want to talk for a few minutes about the budget blueprint that most of you know the President started speaking about this morning with the governors. I'll talk a little bit about what it is and what it isn't, and then talk about where we are in the budget process and what it looks like from here.First of all, what this isn't: This is not a full-blown budget. That will not come until May. So you're not going to see anything in here that has to do with mandatory spending, entitlement reforms, tax policies, revenue projections, or the infrastructure plan. This blueprint was never going to be that, as I made clear during my Senate confirmation. It is a topline number only.As for what it is, these are the President's policies, as reflected in topline discretionary spending. To that end, it is a true America-first budget. It will show the President is keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do when he ran for office. It prioritizes rebuilding the military, including restoring our nuclear capabilities; protecting the nation and securing the border; enforcing the laws currently on the books; taking care of vets; and increasing school choice. And it does all of that without adding to the currently projected FY 2018 deficit.The top line defense discretionary number is $603 billion. That's a $54-billion increase -- it's one of the largest increases in history. It's also the number that allows the President to keep his promise to undo the military sequester. The topline nondefense number will be $462 billion. That's a $54-billion savings. It's the largest-proposed reduction since the early years of the Reagan administration.The reductions in nondefense spending follow the same model -- it's the President keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do. It reduces money that we give to other nations, it reduces duplicative programs, and it eliminates programs that simply don't work. The bottom line is this: The President is going to protect the country and do so in exactly the same way that every American family has had to do over the last couple years, and that's prioritize spending. The schedule from here -- these numbers will go out to the agencies today in a process that we describe as passback. Review from agencies are due back to OMB over the course of the next couple days, and we'll spend the next week or so working on a final budget blueprint. We expect to have that number to Congress by March 16th. That puts us on schedule for a full budget -- including all the things I mentioned, this one does not include -- with all the larger policy issues in the first part of May. So with that, I'll take a couple questions.Yes, sir.Q  Mr. Director, in order to get to your topline on the rest of the nondiscretionary -- or rest of the discretionary budget, if you're not going to touch veterans benefits, you need to slice about 12 percent off of the rest of government. Can't you do that without affecting the services the government provides for --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: And that's part of what this process is this week. The numbers go out, and the numbers -- each agency will get its topline number along with recommendations from OMB as to how we think they can hit that number. And they may come back to us and say, yeah, we think that's a good way to reach that number, or they may come back to us with other suggestions. That's what this process is.I think it's fairly unusual for us to be coming to you this early in the process, but we wanted to let everybody know exactly where we were.Q  But we're not talking about 2 or 3 percent -- we're talking about double-digit reductions, and that's a lot.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: There's going to be a lot of programs that -- again, you can expect to see exactly what the President said he was going to do. Foreign aid, for example -- the President said we're going to spend less money overseas and spend more of it here. That's going to be reflected in the number we send to the State Department.Q  Thank you very much. One quick follow on foreign aid. That accounts for less than 1 percent of overall spending. And I just spoke with an analyst who said even if you zero that out, it wouldn't pay for one year of the budget increases that are being proposed right now. So how do you square that amount? So why not tackle entitlements, which are the biggest driver, especially when a lot of Republicans over the years have said that they need to be taxed?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure. On your foreign aid, it's the same answer I just gave, which is, yes, it's a fairly part of the discretionary budget, but it's still consistent with what the President said. When you see these reductions, you'll be able to tie it back to a speech the President gave or something the President has said previously. He's simply going to -- we are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars. So we will be spending less overseas and spending more back home. I forgot your second question.Q  On entitlements, why not address entitlements, which is the biggest driver of spending?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: It's very unusual to -- this is a budget blueprint -- what some folks used to call a skinny budget -- and it would not be at all unusual for larger policy decisions, including tax reform, revenue projections not to be included in this budget. That will come in --Q  Down the line?Q  Sir --Q  Hold on. So down the line, could we see some type of budget that deals with entitlements?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: The full budget will contain the entire spectrum of the President's proposed policy changes.Q  Director, on rebuilding the military, can you talk a little bit about more of the breakdown of that? Can you go into a little bit more detail?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, I can't -- because, again, where we are in this process is that the numbers going to the DOD today and over the course of the next 10 days to two weeks, we'll be coming up with those types of details.I've got time for one more.Q  Will you be asking the military -- you're going to increase the military budget, but are you going to at least ask the people in the Defense Department to take a look at their budget and say, hey, where can we at least cut or at least look and make sure that we're spending the right amount of money? Is part of that is going to be part of the process?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, absolutely. That's part of what Secretary Mattis and I have already talked. He's interested in driving more efficiencies into the Defense Department. OMB is also going to be involved with him on the procurement process. All of that will be incorporated in our larger budget in May.Q  So it's not just like a blanket -- ""Here, we're going to throw money at you, do what you want""?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, sir. No, sir.Last one.Q  Does this account for spending for the President's wall, either in the $30 billion we've heard you're going to request for this year or the $54 billion increase? Does that include money for the wall, how to pay for the wall?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: It would be more likely -- excuse me, a little bit of both. We do expect to include some money in a future supplemental for 2017 for the wall, and a 2018 budget will also contain some longer-term dollars for that.Q  So it will be split up between the two.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I believe that to be the case.Thank you all very much.MR. SPICER: Thank you, Director.So let me get back to -- I'll be right there in a second, April. This morning, the President dropped by the National Governors Association meeting, where 49 governors from both states and territories joined Cabinet members and senior White House staff to discuss where they can work together to rebuild the country and restart the economy.While at the meeting, the President delivered a statement on his forthcoming budget proposal, which he'll submit March 16th, as you just heard the Director mention. The President's budget will, first and foremost, keep Americans safe. That means investing in both our nation's physical and financial security. We will rebuild the nation's military. An increase in defense spending, including increased funding for our veterans and our border, will be matched by equal reductions in nondefense programs. The savings in our budget will come from looking at outdated and duplicative programs. The reductions spending will be sensible and rational, but they will also be tough. With our nation's debt spiraling out of control, we simply must take a look at the way we're spending taxpayers' dollars. Families across the country are being forced to make difficult choices, because for too long the federal government has not treated their money with the respect they deserve. The national debt exploded under the last administration from $10.6 billion [trillion] on January 20th, 2009 to $19.9 trillion the day before -- sorry, those are both trillions -- the day before the President's -- President Trump's inaugural. Every child born in America this year will inherit an average of over $60,000 in debt. And that, frankly, is too much.Our budget will restore respect for taxpayers' dollars while funding all the necessary programs to keep our country safe and prospering. This meeting with the governors was a continuation of a weekend of engagement and discussion between the governors and the administration. The President and the First Lady welcomed the governors last night to the White House for the Annual Governors Ball. And yesterday, the Vice President had a very productive meeting with several governors.The administration is proud to be working with the governors on rebuilding our nation's infrastructure, reforming our healthcare system, and putting Americans back to work. I know that Obamacare, in particular, was put into place without a lot of input from governors. We're committed to consulting and including them on this and so many other subjects as we solve the nation's biggest issues together.Later this morning, the President had a listening session with some of our country's leading healthcare insurance companies. Interestingly, on yesterday's ABC ""This Week,"" Minority Leader Pelosi actually laid out a great outline of how to judge Obamacare's success based on what it was supposed to achieve. She said, ""It had three goals: One, to lower the cost, the other to expand benefits, and the third to improve and increase access.""So let's go through her criteria. Lowering costs: While this year all four tiers of Obamacare insurance plans are facing double-digit increases in average premiums. Just to take a look at one set of premiums, for standard silver plans in the states, 63 percent increase in Tennessee, 69 percent increase in Oklahoma, and a staggering 116 percent increase in Arizona.On expanding benefits: In reality, the new laws mandates have led to max cancellations of coverage, soaring out-of-pocket costs, and declining enrollment figures. Millions are choosing to pay a tax over buying the government-mandate insurance.Increased access: With insurance fleeing the marketplace, Americans are facing a dwindling number of insurance choices with 17 percent of Americans left with only one insurer option available in their exchange. Insurers will be indispensable partners in the transition period out of Obamacare into the Patients First plan the President will be working with Congress to put in its place. The Presidents plan will encourage innovation, modernize our healthcare system, and provide immediate relief, and ensure access to quality, truly affordable care.This afternoon, the President had lunch with Vice President Pence and Ambassador Haley. Afterwards, hes having a meeting with Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McConnell. And then following that, hes going to be meeting with Secretary of State Tillerson. The Secretary is coming off a very successful trip to Mexico that -- he was joined by Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly. Im sure the President is looking forward to discussing that trip with the Secretary.Also this afternoon, the Vice President will be speaking to an extraordinary group of 60 presidents of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. There will be a pool spray at the top of the event, and the Vice Presidents office will release his remarks and photos following the event. We can also expect a meeting with the President with them as well.This evening, the President will have dinner with regional press affiliates that are going to be in town for the joint session of Congress. While its tradition for representatives from the networks to meet with the President before his joint address, this is the first time, to my knowledge at least, that the opportunity has been expanded to include representation from 18 regional outlets from around the country.Tomorrow, the President will also have the traditional lunch with the network anchors. Beyond the so-called ""big five"" networks, weve also opened it up and invited outlets including Telemundo, Univision, CBN, EWTN, OANN, PBS, C-SPAN, and TV1. Tonight, the President looks forward to seeing his nominee for the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, confirmed by the Senate. Secretary-designate Ross has been an important champion for U.S.-struggling industries in the private sectors. And pending his confirmation this evening, hell now do in the same post on behalf of the American people what he has done in private sector. Assuming everything goes according to the plan in the Senate tonight, we expect to have his swearing-in tomorrow here at the White House. Also tomorrow, the President will deliver his first address to both houses of Congress. In his speech, the President will lay out an optimistic vision for the country, crossing traditional lines of party, race, socioeconomic status. As I said before, the theme will be the renewal of the American spirit. He will invite Americans of all backgrounds to come together in the service of a stronger and brighter future for our nation.In addition to laying out the concrete steps the President has already taken to make the American Dream possible for all of our people, he will talk about the bold agenda -- he wants to work with Congress. This includes tax and regulatory reform to provide relief to hardworking Americans and their businesses, making the workplace better for working parents, ensuring the families who have suffered under Obamacares skyrocketing rates see it replaced with a patient-centered alternative, making sure every child in America has access to a good education, a rebuilding of our military and fulfilling of our commitments to veterans to whom we obviously owe a great deal of gratitude.You can expect to see a speech grounded firmly in solving real problems for every American -- how can we make sure that every American who needs a better job get one, how can we get kids who are trapped in failing schools into better ones, how we can keep gangs and drug violence out of our neighborhoods and communities. The President will address the Americans who have been waiting for help from their leaders for too long, and let them know that help is finally on the way.With respect to the speech, we will be having a background briefing sometime this evening here in the briefing room. We will provide additional details later in the afternoon. As you might already know, the Department of Defense presented its preliminary plan to the White House today to defeat ISIS. This plan has been delivered by Secretary Mattis, who is currently briefing the principals on the option presented today in seeking their input and feedback.Finally, I wanted to note the President continues to be deeply disappointed and concerned by the reports of further vandalism at Jewish community -- Jewish cemeteries, rather. The cowardly destruction in Philadelphia this weekend comes on top of similar accounts from Missouri and threats made to Jewish community centers around the country. The President continues to condemn these and any other form of anti-Semitic and hateful acts in the strongest terms. From our countrys founding, weve been dedicated to protecting the freedom of our citizens' rights to worship. No one in America should feel afraid to follow the religion of their choosing freely and openly. The President is dedicated to preserving this originating principle of our nation.And while were at it, I dont want to get ahead of the law enforcement, but I was asked the other day about the story in Kansas -- the shooting in Kansas. And while the story is evolving, early reports out of Kansas are equally disturbing.So with that, Ill be glad to take your questions. Jon.Q  Sean, theres a report this morning that you reached out directly to CIA Director Pompeo. Did you directly contact Director Pompeo and ask him to knock down the New York Times story on the Russia connection?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Jon. Let me kind of, if I may, walk through the entire timeline. I think its important.As I mentioned I think a week ago, the New York Times published a story about what they called contacts between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials. The FBI deputy director was at a meeting here at the White House that morning. After the meeting concluded, he asked the chief of staff to stand back a second, he wanted to tell him that the report in the New York Times was BS. For viewers at home, I think you can pretty much figure what that means, but Ill leave it at that.At that time, the chief of staff said, thank you for sharing that with me, can we let other people know that the story is not accurate. Throughout the day, they went back and forth to see what they thought was appropriate. Finally, came to the conclusion that they did not want to get in the process of knocking down every story that they had issues with. They then -- we then were informed that other people had come to the same conclusions, including -- at that time, Chairman Devin Nunes had told us, hey, Ive been knocking this down, telling reporters. We shared a number with him of a reporter that had contacted us. And again, when the reporters contact us and we said, no, thats not -- to the best of our knowledge thats not true, they were asking us, can you point to -anybody else that can substantiate this? And I think we did a good job of saying, sure, we will share with reporters other people who have come to the same conclusion. So I won't go into the specifics. I will say that I think we did our job very effectively by making sure that reporters who had had questions about the accuracy and the claims made in The New York Times, that we were pointing them to subject-matter experts who understood whether or not that story was accurate or not. And I think just to continue to be very, very clear on this -- it was about the accuracy of the reporting and the claims that were made in there, plain and simple -- about whether or not a story that appeared in The New York Times was accurate. And individual after individual continued to say that, as far as they knew, they werent. I think most of you probably saw Chairman Nunes's comments this morning. He was very clear, number one, that he reached out to us to say, I've been telling people, reporters, that these allegations and descriptions in The New York Times are not accurate. And then we shared that information with him. But he came to us to share that he equally had that issue brought up to him, he was briefed and saw ""no evidence"" that the story was accurate.So the answer is, we have continued to give reporters information and sources that went to the accuracy, or lack thereof, of a report that was in a newspaper. And I think Chairman Nunes also equally said it's interesting how we literally were engaging with the press, saying, if you have a question about the sourcing on this -- obviously, when brought to our attention, we said, it's not accurate as we know, but then most of you and your colleagues who had inquired would say, well, that's great, I'm sure you're saying this, but who else can corroborate this? So our job was to continue to -- when informed -- share sources who had equally come to the same conclusion that the Times story was not accurate.Q  You dont think there's something strange about -- something odd about the White House Press Secretary getting the CIA director on the phone to knock down a story about an investigation?MR. SPICER: No, no, but see, respectfully, you're using words like ""knock down."" There was a story in a newspaper --Q  Was it disputed?MR. SPICER: Hold on. No, no -- there was reporters coming to us saying, there is a story out there, what's your take on it? And our answer was, we dont believe it's accurate, we dont* [do] believe it's false. But obviously that's our take on it. And reporters were saying to us, well, is there anybody that you can point to to substantiate this claim? Now, remember, this all started with the FBI coming to us, bringing to our attention, saying that the story in the Times was not accurate -- in fact, it was BS -- and all we did was simply say, that's great, could you tell other reporters the same thing you're telling us? And I would think that other reporters, yourself included, would think that that would be a helpful thing to get the story straight. All we sought to do was to actually get an accurate report out. And again, I think Chairman Nunes this morning, over and over and over and over again, made it very clear that no evidence that has been brought to his attention suggests that that reporting was accurate.So, respectfully, I think it's interesting that I'm being asked what's appropriate when what we're doing is actually urging reporters to engage with subject-matter experts who can corroborate whether or not something is accurate or not.Q  Should there be a special prosecutor? Darrell Issa has called for a special prosecutor to look into this.MR. SPICER: And I guess my question would be, a special prosecutor for what?Q  To look into the whole Russia connection, the whole Russia influencing --MR. SPICER: And here's my -- right. And I guess my --Q  I mean, he was part of the campaign, so -- I mean, Sessions was part of the campaign, the Attorney General.MR. SPICER: I understand. But here's my question, Jonathan: We have now for six months heard story after story come out about unnamed sources say the same thing over and over again, and nothing has come of it, right? We've heard the same people, the same anecdotes, and we've heard reports over and over again. And as Chairman Nunes made very clear today, he has seen nothing that corroborates that. So at what point -- you got to ask yourself, what are you investigating?Q  Well, Russian interference -- I mean, beyond the context.MR. SPICER: No, and I think that both the House and the Senate have looked at it. You know as well as I do that the intelligence community has looked at it as well. There's a big difference. I think that Russia's involvement in activity has been investigated up and down. So the question becomes at some point, if there's nothing to further investigate, what are you asking people to investigate? I mean, Chairman Nunes spoke very clearly today when asked over and over and over again about all of this, and said that he has seen nothing that leads him to believe that there's there. The President has spoken forcefully time and time again that he has no interests in Russia, he hasnt talked to people in Russia in years, and yet you keep asking -- and when I say ""you,"" collectively -- to try to find something that seemingly, at least the reporting that I'm seeing in different organizations, suggests that there's nothing new that's being reported. It's the same stuff over and over again that we've heard for literally six months. And so the question becomes at some point, what do you need to further investigate if there is nothing that has come out?Q  Can you not categorically deny there were no contacts between the Russians and anybody on the campaign?MR. SPICER: I can't deny -- I can't -- I guess my question is --Q  That's what the investigation would look at.MR. SPICER: Right. And I guess my point is, is that you've had the intelligence community look at Russia's involvement in the election. You had the House and Senate both do the same. And so what I'm trying to ascertain is that at what point -- how many people have to say that there's nothing there before you realize there's nothing there? I can't say unequivocally -- all I'm saying is, the people who have done the investigating about Russia overall and its activities in the United States, specifically now with respect to our election, havent provided anything that leads me to believe or should lead you to believe -- and I continue to see reports coming from -- there were media sources saying when they checked in with law enforcement, or intelligence community sources, there's nothing more than has been previously reported over and over again.So, at some point, you do have to ask yourself, what are you actually looking for? How many times do you have to come to the same conclusion before you take the answer? And that's where I -- Mara.Q  Just to be clear, did you -- just to follow up on that, did you personally reach out to Pompeo? MR. SPICER: I'm not going to discuss what we did internally. I'm just going to say that when we shared -- we did our job about making sure that when people had -- reporters had questions, we let them know what subject-matter experts were available to discuss the accuracy of the newspaper story.Mara.Q  Yeah, I'm sure people will come back to this, but I actually have a budget question, which is: During the campaign, the President said he was not going to touch Medicare or Social Security. His Treasury Secretary repeated that. It sounded like the OMB Director was leaving that as an open question, TBD. I'm just wondering, what's the state of the promise? That we won't touch it for current retirees --MR. SPICER: What the OMB Director made clear is how it works. The budget is dealing with the topline discretionary numbers. Policy decisions are not part of the budget. That was what he was being asked and what he -- so I just want to be clear in terms of what it was. And again, I think --Q  -- the state of the promise. In other words what is the promise. MR. SPICER: Right. And I think the state of the promise is clear. And I think, as you point out, he had made the promise, he stands by the promise. The Treasury Secretary --Q  But what is the promise? Current retirees? People near retirement? Anybody paying into --MR. SPICER: I will follow up specifically on that. But I think the President has made very clear that it's not his intent to do -- he wants to focus on the discretionary side; that entitlement reform is not -- that, with respect to those programs that he mentioned, he stands by his word.Fred.Q  I wanted to ask a couple issues. An executive order on religious freedom had previously been in the works. Will that still come? And if it does, will it extend beyond religious freedom?MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, Fred, what?Q  Will it extend beyond the Johnson Amendment?MR. SPICER: I think we've discussed executive orders in the past, and for the most part we're not going to get into discussing what may or may not come until we're ready to announce it. So I'm sure as we move forward we'll have something.Olivier.Q  Thanks, Sean. Q  I'm sorry, just one more. The issue of types of reforms. Will there be -- how committed is the administration to a border adjustment tax? And is there any concern that there won't be enough conservative support for that; that it could block any meaningful tax reform long-term?MR. SPICER: Well, I'm not going to get into the specifics of tax reform today. The President has made clear that we'll have an outline of the plan very soon. But what I will say is that I think he has talked about the concerns that he has with current regulatory and tax policy that benefit people from moving out of the country and shipping jobs -- or products back in while shedding American workers. He will continue to fight for policies that promote manufacturing and job creation in the United States, and supports American workers. So I dont want to get ahead of the exact nature of the policy. He has been seeking a lot of input. As I mentioned earlier, he's going to talk today with Speaker Ryan and Senator McConnell. I know that both the joint session, the status of repeal and replace, and I'm sure some discussion of tax reform will probably come up. But there's a lot -- we're continuing to move forward and work with them.Olivier.Q  Thanks. A couple on the ISIS strategy. Can you just get to the timetable from now, now that you received it -- what happens? And there's a report that you're asking for $30 billion in emergency defense spending on top of the $54 [billion] in the budget. Is that true? Does that cover the new ISIS strategy? Can you explain what's different between the two?MR. SPICER: Thank you. Right now, literally, that principals meeting -- or principals meeting that I mentioned at the beginning is happening as we speak. So Secretary Mattis was coming over to brief the principals as far as the ISIS plan. And again, part of it was to make sure that he fully discusses the recommendations that he's making and seek the input and feedback of the other principals downstairs. That can help guide where we go from here, how we go. With respect to the funding, I think Director Mulvaney noted that there will be a supplemental at some point. Right now the focus is on the budget, and then we'll go from there.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. Two brief questions. First, I read your statement at the Thursday briefing to Governor Malloy of Connecticut during the NGA meeting. And he responded -- and I quote -- ""Sean didnt read a thing that I said."" He said that he -- in Connecticut, they are already working to get criminals who are in the country illegally out. His objection was to going into warming centers or schools where officials might frighten children. Your response to the Governor on that?MR. SPICER: Well, again, I was asked specifically what his stance -- what the comments were with respect to sanctuary cities. And again, I would reiterate, with all due respect to the Governor, I'm not here to pick a fight with the Governor. I enjoyed my time going to school in the state of Connecticut. I have a kind affection of the Nutmeg State. But the reality is, I think that there's a difference. Whether or not what he wants to do is state funds, maybe -- without knowing the exact nature of how he's funding, what he's funding, it's difficult. The question I was asked at the time was on how we would be handling it. And I think the answer, whether it's Connecticut or California, is that the President's executive order and the President's commitment is to make sure that tax dollars are not used to support programs that are helping people who are not in the country legally and who are not citizens entitled to them.Q  One more question, Sean.MR. SPICER: Okay. Starting early. (Laughter.) Q  For 58 years, when Presidents have gone to Rome, they've always met the Pope, going back to when President Eisenhower met Pope John XXIII. Now, one year ago this week, candidate Trump had a disagreement with this Pope and an exchange of words. When he goes to Rome in May for his first European trip, will he meet with this Pope?MR. SPICER: That's a great question. Obviously, I would be a huge fan of that. But I'm not going to -- I dont think we're at that place in the planning process to make an announcement on any visits with the Pope.Blake.Q  Sean, thank you. Two budget questions, if you dont mind. Mr. Mulvaney, I believe, just said that what the administration plans on putting forward doesnt add to the current deficit projection, which the CBO says is about $560 billion. But he didn't say that it would significantly draw from that either. So my first question is, is the administration comfortable putting something forward that might rack up deficits of potentially hundreds of billions of dollars?MR. SPICER: Well, I think -- I'm trying to understand the question a little, if you can help me with this. Because he --Q  He said it wasnt going to add to it.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  So my question is, he didn't necessarily say it was going to cut from it, either. If it doesn't cut from it, potentially it could be hundreds of billions in deficit. And I'm curious --MR. SPICER: Right, no, but I think -- correct me if I'm wrong -- I mean, he basically made it very clear it doesn't add to the projected baseline deficit. So that continues to be the goal. And I think as we continue to work through this process, the passback, you know, it can work both ways. We could identify further savings and reductions through working with the agencies and departments, but we're going to make sure that the topline number we maintain is as close to that as possible.And as we go through this -- I mean, this is the beginning of the process as the director noted. We send the number to the department or the agency, give them some ideas, how we came up with this, and then they come back to us and either justify why a particular program or office, or what have you, needs to stay in existence or why maybe not the reduction that is offered. But it's a back-and-forth process that will occur over the next few weeks. So to get ahead of it is the problem.Q  Let me ask you what Nancy Pelosi -- to just get a quick reaction to Nancy Pelosi. She put out a statement and said the following: ""Five weeks into his administration, President Trump has not introduced a single jobs bill."" Your reaction to that would be what?MR. SPICER: He's created a lot of jobs. I think that's -- he's continuing to work with Congress on both repealing and replacing Obamacare, tax reform. And, fundamentally, both of those two items alone I think can help spur a lot of economic growth. The meetings that we've had with the CEOs, the health insurers -- there are so many things that are both job-killing and that can be done to help promote a better regulatory and tax climate that lead to job creation.I think that's one of the biggest problems right now is that people in Washington aren't necessarily talking to job creators and saying, what is the impediment that you have to hiring more American workers? What are the impediments that you have to manufacturing more, to building here?The meetings and the actions that the President has taken on both regulatory and other matters have helped spur job creation. You've heard these companies come in over and over again -- the automakers, airlines, Sprint -- I mean, the list goes on and on and on of people saying to the President, because of your agenda, because of your vision, we're willing to commit to hiring additional people to manufacturing more. That's how jobs are created -- it's not through the government. And too often, it's the government regulations that stifle and prevent job creation. And I think the President, as a businessman, fully appreciates and understands how this works and what some of those impediments do to creating jobs and to growing the economy.And so I would just say that you haven't seen anything yet. It's going to continue to be the case.Trey.Q  Thanks, Sean. Is there concern in the administration that a large-scale military buildup will appear threatening to other countries around the world and lead to some sort of arms race with other countries?MR. SPICER: No, I think when you look at the state of some of the infrastructure in our military, whether it's the age of our ships or our planes or some of the other hardware that exists, you recognize that we need to rebuild a lot of these things. The size of our Navy has gone down significantly. And there are new needs and new -- and when you look at the commitment that you have to make not just in one year but in several years, for a lot of these programs -- ships and tanks, even weapons systems -- they don't get built in a month or a day. You have to make a commitment early on to make the investment because of the time that it takes to procure them, to build them, the research and development that goes into it.And so I would just suggest to you that this is the first step in making sure we make the commitment to a military that through, especially through the sequester the last few years, has not gotten the funding it needs to get off life support. There are a lot of things that are being taken care of for the military where they're just continuing to -- they're not putting the systems and the projects in place to allow the military to keep up with the times, and that's a problem.Major.Q  Sean, one investigation question and one budget question. As you may be aware, Bill Owens, the father of William ""Ryan"" Owens, gave an interview with the Miami Herald over the weekend and he said, ""The government owes my son an investigation."" On behalf of the President of the United States, is the President open to an investigation to the raid in Yemen? And the father of Ryan Owens called that a ""stupid"" mission. Is there something that you'd like to communicate to him about that mission that might persuade him otherwise?MR. SPICER: Yeah, thank you. That's multi-part, so let me kind of walk through it slowly.First of all, I can't possibly imagine what he's going through in terms of the loss of his son. I can tell him that on behalf of the President, his son died a hero and the information that he was able to help obtain through that raid, as I've said before, is going to safe American lives. It's going to protect our country more.So he made a sacrifice to this country. He was on his 12th deployment. And I know that his wife, when she spoke to the President, knows that he did this because he loved it, he cared about our nation. And the mission was successful in helping prevent a future attack or attacks on this nation. It obtained a lot of information that will help us keep safe.With respect to his request, it is standard operating procedure for the Department of Defense to undergo what they call a 15-6 review. That review, in this case, is three-pronged. Because there was a fatality and a loss of life, there's that. Because there were civilians involved, that's another. And then third is because there was hardware -- a helicopter that was damaged. That is a separate. So, in fact, there will be three reviews done by the Department of Defense because of the nature of this. But, again, I can't stress enough that on behalf of the President, on behalf of this nation, we express our condolences, extend our prayers to him during this time.Q  As you said, that is standard procedure. Is there anything the President is particularly curious about with this mission, in that it was brought to him, he authorized it quickly? Does he believe in the main it was carried out well and there's nothing that he's particularly curious about in the way either the helicopter was damaged, fatality, the civilian casualties -- anything of the like?MR. SPICER: Well, number one, I've walked through the timetable previously in terms of how long this had been planned for, dating well back into the previous administration. And as you know, their recommendation at the time was to wait for a moonless night. That night wasn't going to occur during President Obama's administration. And so when General Mattis got into the Department of Defense, he was briefed up on the status of the thing, made aware of when the next time was go. We went through the process to ensure that we continued to believe that the mission -- the way it was going to be conducted and the results of the mission would be worthy of action. The conclusion continued to be, as it was prior, that we should move forward. As I mentioned before, I think you can't ever say that, when there's most importantly loss of life and people injured, that it's 100 percent successful. But I think when you look at what the stated goal of that mission was -- it was an information- and intelligence-gathering mission. And it achieved its objectives.So, again, I would express our thoughts and our prayers and our condolences to all of the people in Chief Owens's family and his friends, his shipmates. But it's something that, as a SEAL and as somebody who deployed 12 times, he knew that this was part of the job and he knew what he was doing. And so we're very comfortable with how the mission was executed, and we'll let the Department of Defense go through that review process and then see where that leads us.But I think to get ahead of the three separate reviews that are being done by the Department of Defense would be probably a little irresponsible at this time.Q  Sean --MR. SPICER: Major gets two, too. Q  Just real quick on the budget. As you're aware, to undo the defense sequester, you have to get 60 votes in the Senate because you have a separate domestic sequester number and defense. Are you confident with these numbers and with this kind of heavy discretionary spending cut proposed, you can get the 60 votes to change the law? Because without that change in law, the proposal is just that -- it doesn't become operational.MR. SPICER: I think that when it comes to our nation's security, specifically our nation's military, I don't think that it's a partisan issue. I think that senators from across the country -- whether you're talking about Florida or whether you've got an Army installation or a Navy base, you understand the state of repair that many of our planes, ships and other hardware is in. And I think that there is a bipartisan commitment to give the military and its members the equipment and the tools it needs to succeed and protect this country. So I do feel confident.April.Q  Sean, I have a couple of budgetary questions for you. One, at the press conference, President Trump talked about the fix for inner cities. What is the investment in this budget when it comes to a fix for inner cities?MR. SPICER: It's a good try. I think the Director was very clear --Q  That's one --MR. SPICER: I mean, part of the process today was to start that passback process that he talked about, where we're going to the various departments, whether it's HUD or DOT, and giving them that topline number and then hearing back. So I don't want to get into a specific number with you before we get too far down the process. I think that's a conversation that we're going to have with the agencies and then we will have subsequently with Congress when they start drafting their resolutions.Q  Okay, a follow-up on this, but I do have a question on HBCUs. See, he talked about healthcare. He talked about education and he talked about crime. He needs to talk about Chicago and law enforcement. So you don't have any kind of budgetary numbers when it comes to it? And healthcare is a piece that is one of the line items for this budget.MR. SPICER: That's right. And I'm not saying that we don't have numbers. I'm saying that we're not giving them out. That's a big difference.Q  (Inaudible.)MR. SPICER: I know. (Laughter.) You're going to do a good job trying. (Laughter.)But as the Director noted on this, that they have come up with topline numbers based on their going through each of these agencies budget, and saying, hey, theres a duplicative program here. In some cases, maybe they give them more, maybe they give them less. Part of it is to begin that conversation, that process, with the departments and agencies to figure out what those investments are. Maybe its repurposing existing funds in a different way. So its not necessarily a zero-sum game. There is a way that a department can reallocate money to a program that might end up benefitting because there is a duplicative or out-of-date program or office that that savings could be applied to something. But I dont want to get ahead of the process right now, only to say that we are at the very beginning of it.Q  And one on HBCUs.MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  The President is going to see the 80-plus presence of HBCUs with the Vice President today. Some of them are very concerned as to what this executive order looks like, and they are waiting to hear the commitment before they say, ""Im all in."" What is the commitment that this President is trying to make when it comes to HBCUs to ensure, I guess, their future, or deal with funding for research projects, what have you, or moving it out of the Department of Education to the purview of the White House? What is the commitment that hes going to give to them?MR. SPICER: So, look, I dont generally speak about executive orders until theyre finalized. I will just say that one of the things that I think theres commitment from this White House to do is to look at the various resources throughout the federal government that support HBCUs.So, for example, the Department of Defense has ROTC and NROTC programs. Are they being properly -- is that funding being properly executed and spent. Theres programs within each of the departments -- the Department of Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development -- that affect grants or programs or direct funding that go to HBCUs for various different things, whether its construction projects, or teaching programs, or mentorship programs. Whatever it is, they span throughout the entire government. And I think that what we are committed to doing is ensuring that there is a high level of understanding and commitment, that goes straight to the President, of how we harness those resource within the government, and make sure that theyre doing what theyre supposed to be doing.So its one thing to have them, right, spread throughout the different departments. Its another thing to make sure that theres a direct pipeline to the President of the United States that those programs are being executed in a way thats benefitting the future of HBCUs and the various projects and teaching that goes on there.Q  And so what are you saying -- theres going to be a piece that is going to basically go throughout all the agencies to make sure that there is some kind of commitment to HBCUs and contract of like, let's say engineering for some schools, or in research for other schools?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I would say -- I think Im going to stick to waiting until we announce it to get out a lot more. Q  Is that today or tomorrow?MR. SPICER: I anticipate it very soon. How is that? I want to give myself a little wiggle room.Phil Rucker.Q  Yeah, Sean, thanks. A budget-related question, but on infrastructure. The President has repeatedly, including today, again, called for a major infrastructure plan to the tune a trillion dollars -- roads, bridges, tunnels, you name it. Can you explain where that money is going to come from, how it fits into the budget that's under review right now, and what the timeline for that project would be?MR. SPICER: So I think that would be part of a longer-term discussion that were having with Congress. As you know, the President got in office 30-some-odd days ago. The idea of getting a budget is -- you know, its commonly referred to as a skinny budget -- is to get the government to continue to be funding and it will be something that well work with Congress.I understand your point. The President continues to talk about the status --Q  -- a priority for him.MR. SPICER: It is. Absolutely. But I think that weve got to make sure that its done right and that we work with Congress. I think, as you correctly mention, theres obviously a funding mechanism to this. And weve already talked about things like comprehensive tax reform that could add to that discussion. And so I just -- I understand what youre asking in terms of how this would be funded and when it will be coming, and the pay-fors, but were working with Congress to have that discussion. I think that comes probably outside of the budget discussion.Q  And so how does he square that with the need to tighten the belt, which he also talked about today -- weve been spending too much as a government and we need to cut our spending?MR. SPICER: Right, but I think -- but in the same manner that were presenting the budget. So were talking about adding $54 million -- $54 trillion, rather -- a billion dollars to -- thank you. Appreciate the help here. (Laughter.)But were looking to add that to defense. And so what it means is that we have to look through other programs to find reductions in savings. I think that same kind of discussion would happen with respect to infrastructure, not necessarily the savings piece, but the funding piece; that theres several ways -- and I know that theres a lot of discussion, private-public partnerships that he is started to have a discussion with in terms of the funding mechanism.And so all Im trying to get at is that there are various ways to do this funding without just relying on the American taxpayer in terms of additional taxes. There are spending reductions, there are other funding mechanisms, and I think, in due course, we will get around to that discussion.Q  And just related to that, he mentioned in his remarks about infrastructure today that as he drives through the Queens-Midtown tunnel and the Lincoln tunnel, he worries about ceiling tiles falling. Is there a specific incident he was talking about where people have been injured, or is that just a fear of his?MR. SPICER: I dont know. Ill ask. (Laughter.) But Im sure Secret Service will take care of the -- alleviating the medium concerns.Hold on. Alexis.Q  Sean, I have two questions. First, one on healthcare. Because the OMB director was signaling that the complete budget would be made ready early May, and the President today described how complicated he had discovered that the healthcare repeal and replace has become, can you describe when it is that the President would present his framework for an overhaul of healthcare? Is it going to be included in the budget so we would see it before May?MR. SPICER: I dont think youre going to see it in the budget, no. Thats not the appropriate vehicle for it. I think Ive mentioned it before. I think you would drive -- or at least the leading option, before I get locked into something, is to add Obamacare to the FY17 budget process and put it through reconciliation. So that would happen outside of the current budget structure.But I think he has also been very clear that he wants this outline within a matter of weeks, and that we continue to have these discussions with House and Senate leadership, with Ways and Means, and Energy and Commerce, and then similar on Senate finance on the Senate side. So when he talks to Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell today, Im sure that conversation will continue. Q  Just to follow up on healthcare, because not every ingredient in the Affordable Care Act can be handled in reconciliation. Thats why I was asking about the elements of it that we see in the budget.MR. SPICER: Thats right.Q  So we will see some of those?MR. SPICER: Well, theres several pieces of Obamacare. Some can be done by executive order, some get done with 50 votes, some have to be done specifically in reconciliation. I think counter to Majors point on a previous question, that there are certain things that have to be done in certain ways legislatively, and to create a comprehensive and holistic approach to both repealing it and replacing it. And were aware of that. Were working with the House and the Senate to make that happen.Q  And my second topic.MR. SPICER: Of course.Q  All right. The immigration executive order, the travel ban -- is the President going to address the American people and Congress in his speech tomorrow night and specifically describe and defend the immigration ban? And when will we see the revised executive order?MR. SPICER: So were not going to -- I would not anticipate the speech being a defense of legislation and executive orders. I dont think many previous Presidents have gotten through and used that as a legislative walkthrough. But you will hear about his commitment to immigration and his desire for border security, and what it means not just about keeping the nation safe, but what impact its having on the economy. So you will hear a lot about immigration tomorrow night, and he will talk about why it matters and the goal that we have and why we should come together on areas like this.Q  Can I follow up on that, Sean?MR. SPICER: Hold on. Katelyn.Q  Wheres the next order?MR. SPICER: Oh, Im sorry. The next order I think we should have it out probably middle of this week. Looking towards the middle of the week. And well have further updates as we get through the schedule. I think obviously our priority right now today was the really get the budget process kicked off, and then continue to prepare for the joint session.Katelyn.Q  Thank you.Q  Sean, can I follow on that?MR. SPICER: You will in a second.Q  An internal report in 2015 identified $125 billion in wasteful Pentagon spending. So how can you justify adding $54 billion to the defense budget? Is that going to go to hiring soldiers or bureaucrats or contractors? And is the President concerned with wasteful spending at the DOD?MR. SPICER: Of course hes concerned. Hes concerned with wasteful spending throughout the government. But I think theres also a big difference between rooting out waste and fraud in various programs and offices, and understanding that when youre talking about adding to the fleet or increasing airplane costs, that that cant be driven just through those. And the commitment that you have to make to purchase some of those very-needed upgrades to our infrastructure and to our arsenal and to planes and ships doesnt just come through that. Because even if you could start to really identify, you really wouldnt be able to make the financial commitment that needs to be done to rebuild some of the ships and planes in particular that need a substantial investment on the front end.John.Q  If I could just follow on Alexiss question. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has just denied your request to suspend proceedings in regard to the initial executive order. That order came out just within the last few minutes. So do you plan to continue defending your first executive order in court? And whats the purpose of doing that as opposed to simply rescinding it and then rendering that case moot?MR. SPICER: Well, I havent been able to read my phone while this has happened. So I --Q  That's why I read --MR. SPICER: (Laughter.) Thank you, I appreciate it. So with all due respect, I would ask that I be able to get back to you tomorrow on that after we consult with the Counsels Office and go through the briefing and the -- excuse me, the reading of what the court has said. But give me a little time, let me get off the podium --Q  I mean, the rescinding it question still stands, regardless of the --MR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think that the President has made a commitment right now to continue to defend what we did.Q  For what reason?MR. SPICER: Hold on. Because this is the strategy that -- he believes that we have the authority vested in U.S. code. Ive talked about this extensively in the past. And I think that if youll allow me, once we get done with the briefing, I will follow up with the Counsels Office.Q  But the point that some of us are trying to understand is, if you have a new executive order that you believe addresses the concerns of the many courts who have weighed in on this, why continue to defend an executive order that -- MR. SPICER: Because hes -- I mean, because we were right the first time. And I think that --Q  Are you trying to prove a point?MR. SPICER: Hold on -- no, but I think that its not a question of proving a point. Its that the manner in which it was done in the first place was what we believe and continue to believe was the right way to address this problem.And while the second executive order attempts to address the courts concerns that they made, the goal is obviously to maintain the way that we did it the first time because we believe that the law is very clear about giving the President the authority that he needs to protect the country.So just dropping that is not necessarily the most prudent thing. And I think part of it is for us to recoup right now, figure out what the court has said, and then reassess the strategy. But I don't want to get ahead, as you point out, you're reading it to me now -- I would like the opportunity to maybe go read it and actually have a lawyer read it -- since that wont do very much.Go ahead.Q  Sean, thank you. On anti-Semitism, that was a good, strong statement. Is there anything that the federal government can do to protect Jewish institutions? Are there any leads who is doing this? And also on sequester, when can sequester be lifted?MR. SPICER: When can it be lifted?Q  Yes.MR. SPICER: I think we've got to go through the process to lift the sequester, and so well deal with that.With respect to some of the activity that we've seen at Jewish cemeteries in particular -- look, I think we have to work with law enforcement at a local and state level. Ill leave it to the Department of Justice to comment further on what additional steps can be made. But I think -- as has been pointed out multiple times, I think one of the things that we can do is speak from this podium, in particular, and other places to make sure that every American understands what our values are, and that that kind of behavior and activity is wrong and wont be tolerated, and the highest levels of government denounce it.So I think it starts at that. And then I think theres a law enforcement component that I would ask you to touch base with.Q  Sean, two on the budget. MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  I understand this is a blueprint. I understand the President has previously said he doesn't want to touch entitlements. But why does he think its the right move to break with years of Republican orthodoxy, House Speaker Paul Ryan, who have said that any sensible long-term budget needs to include entitlement reform?MR. SPICER: Look, Im just going to -- I think the President understands the commitment that was made to seniors in particular and that it's a sacred bond and a trust.And I think -- look, Mara asked this earlier -- I think let me get back to you on the specifics. But I think he made a commitment to the American people. And one of the things that I think the President continues to get high marks on is that regardless of whether you voted for him or not, or you agree with his policies, hes a man of his word. And he has followed up on the promises that he made to the American people. And I think that's important.Now, again, I think that we will continue to work with Congress. But the President understands that we have commitments that we've made on the entitlement side, in particular, and especially on the senior side with respect to Social Security that need to be maintained. And so hes going to keep this word to the American people. Q  But if you talk to some economic analysts, they say Social Security, Medicare wont be there in a number of years if we don't address the fundamental problems.MR. SPICER: And I think that -- right. And so for right now, I think the budget that we're laying out deals on the discretionary side. You've heard the Presidents priorities and commitment, especially when it comes to protecting this country. And if we have anything further, Ill let you know.Q  And one more -- Sean, one more. Is there an internal leak inquiry right now?MR. SPICER: Not that Im aware of.Q  Thank you very much, Sean. I have two questions on U.S.-China relationship, if I may.MR. SPICER: You may.Q  Thank you.MR. SPICER: Everyone else gets two.Q  First of all, since President Trump took office, China sends it very first senior official, State Counselor Yang Jiechi, to visit Washington, D.C. today. Will there will be a meeting with in the White House, and whats the White Houses expectation of his visit?MR. SPICER: So the State Counselor, and for those of you not schooled in the Chinese government, is basically the equivalent of our NSA Director -- NSC Director, correct? Q  Yes.MR. SPICER: So the Ambassador and the State Counselor came today. They had a meeting with H.R. McMaster, Jared Kushner, and I think some others sat in on the meeting. They had a delegation of six people here. After the meeting ended, I believe the State Counselor was taken and had an opportunity to say hi to the President before he left. This is an opportunity to begin that conversation and talk to them on shared interests of national security.Q  Sean --MR. SPICER: Sorry, hold on. He gets one more. Everybody else did. Q  Can I have a follow up?MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me just -- everybody else got two.Q  Yes, just this morning, President Trump mentioned about his pick for ambassador to China, Governor --MR. SPICER: Branstad.Q  Branstad. Governor Branstad apparently has a really positive view on China. MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q  So how confident the President is on the Governors confirmation to get all the support in the Senate?MR. SPICER: Oh, I think hell receive tremendous support -- bipartisan support. Governor Branstad has been -- is a true -- he has huge ties on both sides. I think hes one of the longest serving governors ever, definitely in Iowa. And I think that he has tremendous respect from both sides of the aisle not just for how hes handled himself as a governor in Iowa, but his deep understanding and ties to China and to Chinas economy and to Chinese officials. And I think hes going to do a phenomenal job representing our nation.He starts with a deep understanding of the Chinese economy, the Chinese government, and that is going to really serve our nation well.Mara.Q  Can I just have a follow-up on China? Thank you. Because I know I got one before.MR. SPICER: You did. Q  I appreciate that. A lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they felt -- they agreed with him that the U.S. was getting ripped off by China. And after the election, he made the call to Taiwan, which he was praised for. Then he told Fox News -- he said, ""I don't know why we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade."" Then he reaffirmed the one-China policy. So what did he get in return from China for doing that?MR. SPICER: Well, he had a conversation with President Xi. Im not going to get into the details of it. But at the Presidents -- President Xis request and after a discussion, the President reaffirmed the one-China policy. The President is not one to discuss his negotiating tactics. So I --Q  But did he get something? Can he assure the American people he got something?MR. SPICER: The President always gets something. Ryan.Q  Well, what was it? What was it? Q  Sean, two quick follow-ups. First of all, I noticed earlier today there were a lot of Republican governors out here but not very many Democratic governors. Is this administration actively attempting to reach out to the other side of the aisle for compromise?MR. SPICER: Yeah. I think if you saw the remarks during this pool opportunity, the President talked about some of the conversations he had with Governor McAuliffe in Virginia in particular. But they were here last night, they had dinner with their wives and husbands. It was an opportunity to really talk to the Cabinet and get to know each other and talk about priorities.I will say that -- its interesting, I mentioned Obamacare. When one of the things that was brought up by the governors -- and Ive got to be honest, I wasnt picking which governors and thinking of party -- but it came up over and over again that they actually -- several of them commented on how appreciative they have been in terms of seeking their input on not just healthcare but infrastructure and Medicaid, in particular, and other areas that fall into their thing -- to their wheelhouse.So I think -- just so were clear, the dialogue that exists between this administration and this President and governors I think is a very refreshing move forward.Q  And then my point -- a follow-up, a quick follow-up. I want to clarify a little bit of something that happened Thursday and Friday about the public enemy statement. Are you saying that all of the press is the public enemy? People who didnt vote for the President? Just the people in this room, or -- is it just Bill Maher and maybe Warren Beatty? Can you clarify what were talking about?MR. SPICER: I think the President made clear in his tweet that he was referring to the fake news and people who ascribe to pushing fake stories is where his target was.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. As you know, more than 60 Democrats either boycotted or skipped the Presidents inauguration. What kind of reception do you think the President will get tomorrow evening from Democrats in the House and Senate when he gives his joint address?MR. SPICER: Well, I hope a very robust and applause-filled reception. The speech, as I mentioned, breaks down a lot of barriers that have traditionally been political barriers in terms of areas where I think we should find agreement that reaffirm the Presidents desire to unite the country and unite our parties in areas of shared common ground.And I think the things that hes talking about -- increasing the support to our military, our veterans; helping children get an education -- those are things that hopefully we can all come together and think are shared American values, regardless of party. I hope that we see a tremendous amount of support for the President and his policies and his vision tomorrow night. He recognizes the problems that our nation faces, but he also charts a vision forward. And I think its one that if people are honest, that they will agree that it really isnt a political agenda as much as an agenda for this country and one to move us forward.So I think that well have to wait and see, but I can tell you that I think it will be a positive move forward.Zeke.Q  Thanks, Sean. Couple follow-ups to Oliviers question earlier about the ISIS review. Its day 30. The memorandum the President signed 30 days ago said that he was supposed to be briefed. Can you give us a more -- a timeline on when specifically President Trump will be involved -- I know you mentioned theres a principals meeting earlier today -- what the timeline of the review is? And then separately, you mentioned that Secretary Mattis was the one whos presenting it to the principals committee. The memorandum included things other than just the military; it included public diplomacy efforts to cut off financial ties to ISIS. What were the other Cabinet secretaries involved? What is sort of -- what got us here and where do we go from here?MR. SPICER: Thank you. Let me, if I may, get briefed on who and what occurred in the principals meeting to the extent that its available, and Id be glad to get back to you tomorrow on that. I just dont have that information available.Gabi.Q  Thanks, Sean. Palm Beach County has said that its costing $60,000 a day in overtime pay every time the President comes to visit West Palm Beach. Hes slated to go there again this weekend according to some reports. Is the President taking any steps to ensure that taxpayers arent saddled with tremendous costs in his travel habits, considering he was so critical of his predecessor on that matter?MR. SPICER: Well, Gabi, the security for the President and the First Family is set by the Secret Service. As you know, they determine the security measures that need to be taken to protect the President -- frankly, any President. So Im going to leave it up to the Secret Service to decide what security measures and steps are taken to protect the President.And, as you know, I mean, this -- depending on -- it transcends administrations. Wherever the President goes, they need to make sure that the President and the First Family is safe. Thats something that I think -- we rely on the Secret Service to make those determinations. They continue to do a phenomenal job making sure that the First Family and the President and the Vice President are protected, and we have full confidence in the decisions that they make.So thank you guys very much. Well have a briefing tomorrow -- later today on the state.Q  Approximate time?MR. SPICER: Whats that?Q  Approximate time?MR. SPICER: I would look in the 6 o'clock hour. Q  Here?MR. SPICER: Yes, here.Q  After 6:00?MR. SPICER: I get to see you here again. I would plan on around 6:00. Well have further guidance. And I dont anticipate it being long. I think were just going to walk through the -- off camera. Well walk through the themes of the speech, take any questions, and then try to get some additional information, depending on where the President is in his read-through.Q  No briefing tomorrow, right?MR. SPICER: No briefing tomorrow. If you dont want one, you dont have to have one.Q  You said youd get back to us on a couple of issues tomorrow.MR. SPICER: Well, Im -- its April that brought up no briefing. If you guys want to vote --Q  No, no, no, but tradition is theres no briefing on -- thats why Im asking.MR. SPICER: I know. We will do something for you, I promise. We will make sure we get back --Q  Is it going to be a gaggle like last Friday, or is it going to be --MR. SPICER: No, no, we will get back to you. Im sure youll see my face here tomorrow. Thank you very much. Ill see you guys tomorrow.END2:46 P.M. EST",20837.44,15.680000000000291,5861.9,16.589999999999236,2369.75,2.4099999999998545

221,2017-02-27,Remarks by the Vice President at a Listening Session with Historically Black Colleges and Universities,"Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Room 3505:36 P.M. ESTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you. Thank you to Secretary DeVos, the Secretary of Education. Secretary Betsy DeVos. I can't tell you how wonderful it is to be able to say that. You can give her another round of applause. Shes going to be working closely with all of you. To the presidents of our Historically Black Colleges and Universities, representatives of the United Negro College Fund, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, distinguished guests, welcome to the White House.It is my great privilege to serve as Vice President of the United States with the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump. And I know -- I know that you all just came from a brief meeting in the Oval Office. (Laughter.) So I know you've already experienced the Presidents warm hospitality and heard his expressions of appreciation for your leadership and for your willingness to come together to discuss the important work that each of you, and the desire of this administration to continue to partner -- partner with you on behalf of education all across this country.My note said that the President wanted me to send greetings to you, but he already did. (Laughter.) Which happens to me a lot. The President is a very hospitable person. And when he hears that there are wonderful people like yourselves in the White House, you see what happens. And Im so pleased that you had a chance to share a few minutes with him today.Earlier this month, President Trump signed a proclamation marking Black History Month. In that proclamation, it read that, the history of African Americans exemplifies the resilience and the spirit that continue to make our Nation great.And those words are true and we celebrate them with you today. Over the past month he visited the African American History Museum, and just last week he dedicated his weekly radio address to Black History Month. The President understands, as you saw firsthand today, the importance of recognizing the African American communitys amazing contributions to the life of this nation.And that's why I wanted to come over here today on the Presidents behalf. And the schools represented here really have made an indelible mark for generations on the life of this nation.Its amazing to think about it, for more than 150 years, historically black colleges and universities have educated African American leaders, often when no other opportunity was available to them.The first school -- Cheyney University, in Pennsylvania, founded in 1837, more than 20 years before the Civil War. It and the schools that followed have furnished the type of learning that the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., would describe over a century later as Intelligence plus character -- the goal of true education.The path has not been an easy one throughout the long 150-year history for your institutions. And your students, your faculty, your professors have stood firm through a transformational time in the life of the nation and been a part of that transformation in countless ways. You've transformed lives through education. You've helped lead our country toward a more perfect union. And just know the President and I and all the members of our administration appreciate and admire the contribution of our historically black colleges and universities. Would you just give yourselves a round of applause? It is a history to be proud of. (Applause.)Today, with over 100 historically black colleges and universities in 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, hundreds of thousands of African American students have turned to you for quality education, including, Im told, more than 300,000 students as we speak today. (Applause.)Even more inspiring than that, I am told that many of those students were the first in their family to go to college. My dad was in that category and went off to college and raised each one of us kids with that finger pointed in the middle of our chest. (Laughter.) You know what Im talking about? I just don't ever remember a day that Dad didn't look at me and say, I don't care what you else you do with your life, but you're going to college. (Laughter.) And those first generation college students transform families and they transform a nation. And we celebrate them and their role on your campuses even through this day. And throughout the history of your institutions when those first-time students graduated, they departed, degree in hand, prepared and determined to add their own unique brush stroke to the beautiful American tapestry and the legacy of African Americans.And so many have in some many countless ways. They've done just that. If you think about it, nearly one in four African Americans with a bachelors degree graduated from your schools. (Applause.) This includes leaders in every industry in this country and in every walk of life. Forty percent of African American members of Congress -- as a former member of Congress, Im happy to report 40 percent of African American members of Congress graduated from a historically black college and university. (Applause.)The indisputable conclusion is that your schools have played a major role, not only in the African American community, but in the life of nation, and the life of the nations economy. And we really gather today to reflect on that and to celebrate that. And those gathered here from across our administration look forward to a dialogue with each one of you about how we can continue to strengthen the role that historically black colleges and universities play in the lives of families across this country and in the life of this nation.America is unquestionably stronger because of the institutions that are represented here. And this evening, President Trump and I just wanted to express our thanks. As the President said in his recent radio address, your schools do a fantastic job.  His words. (Laughter.) And you deserve far more credit than you get, and know that beginning today, this administration is committed to making sure that our historically black colleges and universities get the credit and the attention they deserve. (Applause.)Our administration at the Presidents direction is working to find new ways to expand your impact so that more students, especially in the underserved communities in this country, have the chance at a quality education. We want to partner with you. We want to partner with you to help train the students of today to face the challenges and to lead in America tomorrow.This also requires us to help students at an even earlier age -- make no mistake about it. Secretary DeVos is dedicated to expanding opportunities through educational choice all across this country, ensuring that whether its a public school, a public charter school, or even a private school -- that parents on an increasing basis will have the ability to choose where their young children go to school regardless of their income and area code. And we're going to work with each one of you to make that a reality. We're also going to be working on economic development, not only increasing educational opportunities but doing all we can to revitalize communities across this country -- large and small -- and create opportunities for students that will be joining you on your campuses. Were committed to this mission. As you've heard the President over the course of his campaign, and now you've seen him firsthand today, this President has a passion for equality of opportunity. He has a passion for expanding opportunities and the hopes and dreams of every American, including those in the African American community who are not yet experiencing the full range of benefits of the American Dream.So get ready for a great and energetic partnership in the days ahead. As Frederick Douglass reminds us, education is the means -- or education means the lifting up of the soul of man into the glorious light of truth. Powerful words -- uplifting of the soul of man into the glorious light of truth. That's what your institutions have been about for now a century and a half in America.And so I came to say thank you on behalf of the President of the United States. Thank you for all you do. Beyond the profound words that I quoted before, when I look at the role of historically black colleges and universities, I can't help but think of even more ancient words that: If you train up a child in the way they should go, then after theyre old, theyll not depart from it.The contributions of historically black colleges and universities for a century and a half in our nations history have trained up young men and women who have gone on to lead this nation and to lead us to a more prosperous and more perfect union. And our commitment to all of you and our hope and our prayer is that we're going to partner with you that that will be even more true; and your contribution and your influence in America will only grow in the years ahead.Thank you very much. God bless you for your work. And thank you for coming today. (Applause.)END5:47 P.M. EST",20837.44,15.680000000000291,5861.9,16.589999999999236,2369.75,2.4099999999998545

230,2017-02-28,Excerpts from President Donald J. Trump's Address to a Joint Session of Congress,"Excerpts from remarks as prepared for deliveryEach American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice  in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.And weve spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a 5-year ban on lobbying by Executive Branch Officials  and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone.As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS  a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, women, and children of all faiths and beliefs.We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim World, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy  making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much harder for companies to leave.My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone.At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and at the same time, provide better Healthcare.Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for America.The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.Obamacare is collapsing  and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. Action is not a choice  it is a necessity.So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster.My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest inwomens health, and to promote clean air and clear water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a brighter future.Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a Rare Disease Survivor, Megan Crowley. Megan was diagnosed with Pompe Disease, a rare and serious illness when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past 5.On receiving this news, Megans dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megans life. Today she is 20 years oldand a sophomore at Notre Dame. Megans story is about the unbounded power of a fathers love for a daughter.Finally, to keep America safe we must provide the men and women of the United States Military with the tools they need to prevent war and  if they must  TO FIGHT AND TO WIN.I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester, and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history.My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our Veterans have delivered for this nation  and now we must deliver for them.The challenges we face as a nation are great.But our people are even greater.And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform.But we know that America is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.We must learn from the mistakes of the past  we have seen the war and destruction that have raged across our world.The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people.Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect.And streets where mothers are safe from fearschools where children learn in peaceand jobs where Americans prosper and groware not too much to ask.When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before.The time for small thinking is over.The time for trivial fights is behind us.We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.The bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls.And the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations  not burdened by our fears.",20812.24,-25.19999999999709,5825.44,-36.460000000000036,2363.64,-6.110000000000127

232,2017-02-28,"Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sander, 2/28/2017","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room3:07 P.M. ESTMS. SANDERS: Good Afternoon. Sorry for the delay. Obviously, I never want to step on anything the President is doing, so I wanted to wait until he finished. The President has obviously got a full day and night planned, so Im going to try to keep this short so that you guys can get focused on his speech coming up later.First off, and I know Sean briefly spoke about this yesterday -- and, by the way, just for clarification, he is not here, clearly, because he is up on the Hill briefing House and Senate communicators about the speech and previewing that for them right now. But Sean mentioned this yesterday, and Im sure that it stuck with me, but the story has developed further. I wanted to address the tragic shooting in Kansas. The President is keeping the family of the victim, who was senselessly, killed in his thoughts, and were praying for the full and speedy recovery of those who were wounded.As more facts come to light, and it begins to look like this was an act of racially-motivated hatred, we want to reiterate that the President condemns these and any other racially- or religiously-motivated attacks in the strongest terms. They have no place in our country, and we will continue to make that clear.In regards to the rest of the events today, this morning the Vice President swore in Secretary Ross as the Secretary of Commerce in his ceremonial office, and the President knows Secretary Ross is eager to get started building the country back up again, and were glad to finally have him in place at the Commerce Department to do just that.Moving on to the Presidents day, this morning, after receiving his national daily intelligence briefing, the President met with the National Association of Attorneys General, and then had lunch with members of the press, as is tradition for the day of the joint address to Congress. This afternoon, the President, as most of you saw, just signed two bills and executive orders. The first bill, H.R. 321, also known as the INSPIRE Act, encourages NASA to have women and girls participate in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and to pursue careers in aerospace using extreme programs and resources. H.R. 255, or the Promoting Women and Entrepreneurship Act, is a similar bill targeted to the National Science Foundation. The bill encourages NSF to also use existing programs to recruit and support the employment of women in the sciences. These bills are the next step in the Presidents continued focus on empowering women of all ages and all interests to pursue their chosen careers. As you saw, the President and Prime Minister Trudeau spent an afternoon speaking with female business leaders about the unique challenges facing women in the workplace earlier this month. And just last week, during his listening session with manufacturing CEOs, the President heard from a breakout group focused specifically on policies that could help lessen or remove some of those same barriers.The President also signed two executive orders. The first instructs the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to review and reconsider the Obama administrations Clean Water Rule, as well as providing instruction to the Attorney General for current legal action on the rule. The Obama administrations rule vastly expands federal jurisdiction into state and local areas, and the decisions that directly affects them, and thats something that this administration does not take lightly. The second executive order will make Historically Black Colleges and Universities a priority again in the White House. This order provides a framework for repositioning the HBCU initiative in the White House, allowing it to function across all executive departments and agencies in consultation with the Department of Education.As you might have seen yesterday, the President welcomed the over 60 presidents of HBCUs and representatives from leading HBCU organizations to the Oval Office before their listening session with the Vice President and Secretary DeVos. The President is extremely committed to keeping the promises he made regarding HBCUs on the campaign trail, and looks forward to working with these leaders and organizations to provide HBCUs with the resources that they need.Later this afternoon, probably right about now, the President is meeting with the guests who will be seated with the First Lady at his first address to the Joint Congress. We provided a list and shorts bios of each of the guests via email last night. Now, Im also able to confirm two additional guests for the First Lady: Jessica Gregory and her proud mother, Sheila Gregory. Jessica was diagnosed at birth with spina bifida, and has undergone 11 surgeries at Childrens National Health System. Today, she is a dynamic 18-year-old honor student in Maryland, planning for college and a career as a public interest reporter, which was sparked by her experiences at Childrens National Seacrest Studios.Later this evening, the President will proceed to the U.S. Capitol where he will address the Joint Session of Congress at 9:10 p.m. And, of course, I dont want to spoil anything, but its safe to say that the President will be presenting a forward-looking vision to the American people. Hes already proven that he can bring results and relief to this country, and a wave of optimism is surging across the country in response. In terms of an outline of some of the policy areas the President will address during his speech, the President will specifically ask Congress to join him in coming up with and implementing solutions to restart the engine of our economy, provide more access to quality, affordable healthcare, expand educational opportunities to every child no matter their zip code, and unite with law enforcement and the military to protect our communities and our homeland.Together, with the help of Congress, state and local governments, the President will set our country back on the path to a bright future. Speaking of future, looking ahead in the schedule, I have some updates on the Presidents upcoming travel. On Thursday, he will travel to Virginia to give remarks aboard the USS Gerald Ford, and participate in a roundtable with military officials, shipbuilders, and community leaders. Initial guidance for that has already been sent out, and well have updates for credentialed media coming soon.On Friday, the President will attend a listening session on school choice at St. Andrews Catholic School in Florida, and well have guidance for that out soon. And with that, Ill take you questions.Phil.Q  Yeah, Sarah, thanks. Two things: First, can you --MS. SANDERS: Of course, lets not mess with tradition here.Q  Very -- theyre simple things. Can you confirm a discussion that happened with the network anchors about immigration, where apparently the President is now open to a compromise bill on immigration reform, and something he might include in the speech tonight? And the second point is regarding the State Department budget. There are some reports out there about possibly a 37 or 38 percent cut to the State Department budget. MS. SANDERS: So Ill start with the first question. I was not a participant in the lunch today, so not part of the specific conversation, so I cant speak to the exact conversation that took place. But I do know that the President has been very clear in his process that the immigration system is broken and needs massive reform, and he has made clear that he is open to having conversations about that and moving forward.Right now, his primary focus, as he had made over and over again, is border control and security at the border, and deporting criminals from our country, and keeping our country safe. And those priorities have not changed.Q  And the State Department?MS. SANDERS: And the State Department -- as we said before, I think -- not congressman anymore --- but OMB Director Mulvaney made it pretty clear that the budget priorities that we laid out were just that -- they were priorities. And right now, were in a discussion process. This is the same historically today that it always works: We put out our priorities, we lay those out to the departments, they offer feedback to us, and so right now were just in a discussion process. So theres nothing firm and exact on any numbers that may be coming out of that.Kristen.Q  Two subjects for you. Kansas -- you started off your remarks talking about it. Can we expect the President to address that tonight? And forgetting about what may or may not have been discussed, is the President open to an immigration bill that would include a pathway to citizenship without undocumented immigrants leaving the country?MS. SANDERS: On your first question, I wouldnt be surprised if that was mentioned in the speech tonight. In terms of the immigration, again, I havent had further conversations with him about that today, but I do know that his priorities have been very clear on immigration, and thats the number one focus right now.Q  One follow on that. Is it safe to say he wouldnt --MS. SANDERS: Thats three now.Q  -- rule out -- its a follow. Its a follow-up.MS. SANDERS: Just so you know, Im not like Sean. Im not going to let her set precedents and take three questions from everybody.Q  Very quick follow. Is it safe to say he wouldnt rule out the possibility of an immigration bill that would not deport people who dont have criminal records? In other words, is the focus still on those with criminal records? And is he very seriously considering some type to carve-out for those who dont have criminal records?MS. SANDERS: Again, the focus is certainly on those with a criminal background and criminal record. But until Ive had a chance to have a conversation with the President, Im not going to speak to that any further.Sure, go ahead.Q  Thank you. Two questions, of course. First off, the budget and possible reductions to the State Department. Would that indicate -- would those reductions indicate any desire to run foreign policy more directly out of the White House as opposed to through the State Department and career diplomats? MS. SANDERS: Im sorry, Im not following what youre asking here.Q  Cuts to the State Department. There have been reports saying that Secretary Tillerson has been sort of marginalized in a lot of foreign policy discussions going on. And do these cuts indicate any desire to run foreign policy more directly from the White House and not through the State Department?MS. SANDERS: Well, I would disagree that Secretary Tillerson has been marginalized. I think nothing could be further from the truth. And so I wouldnt rely on sources outside of the White House in terms of who will be making decisions. And at this point, the Secretary of State is very much empowered to do that. Nothing has changed on that front.Q  Second question.MS. SANDERS: Go ahead.Q  Not to belabor a point, but to follow up on Kristens question. The reports that are out there are still coming in about this conversation that was had today, but is it fair then to say that the President supports at least a compromise immigration bill? And then just give us a few details on how hes spending the afternoon in terms of this speech. Like, is it done? Is he still tweaking? Things like that.MS. SANDERS: I love that if we keep asking the same question we think we might get a different answer. I know. I appreciate the effort; I think you guys get As for effort. But again, Im going to continue to say: Until Ive had a chance to have that conversation with the President, Im not going to speculate on what that would look like.In terms of the afternoon, I know right now he is currently meeting with the people that will be seated with the First Lady. And this afternoon, he has plans to work through the speech and practice and make any last-minute changes to that. Go ahead.Q  So those people that hes meeting with right now, is he going to be directly referencing them in his speech tonight?MS. SANDERS: I think you can rest assured that most of those names will come up in the speech tonight.Q  And any idea when the excerpts will be coming out?MS. SANDERS: I think we may have some later this afternoon. I dont know that well have the full text of the speech before, but I do believe well have at least some nuggets of the speech that we will release later today.Shaileagh (ph). Q  Thank you. So first, on the JCC threats, apparently Pennsylvania Attorney General Shapiro is saying that in part of his conversation with the President, the President indicated that these threats may have come from the reverse"" or ""to make others look bad. Do you dispute that characterization of -- what did the President mean by that? Was he saying that these anti-Semitic threats are coming from -- I dont know, you tell us.MS. SANDERS: Look, I wasnt part of a private conversation. What I do know is the conversations that I have had with the President, hes been extremely clear and extremely consistent on this topic. Any act of violence towards people of the Jewish faith is condemned by this administration. Full stop.Q  And then one on healthcare, as well. There have been -- some Republicans have now come out publicly against the draft plan that is being circulated in Congress on repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. Is the President concerned about the fact that more conservatives are now saying they couldnt support that plan? And what is his message to those Republicans?MS. SANDERS: Not at all, because the draft plan is exactly that -- a draft. Its meant to open up the conversation. The last several days the President has spent time with governors, hes meeting with attorney generals, hes met with CEOs of major healthcare companies to talk about how they can improve that plan.The big things that hes made a priority is that we will repeal Obamacare but replace it with something better. And thats a lot of what these conversations that hes had over the last several days are helping to do, is to make that plan better. And the one thats been floated out there is nothing more than a draft.April.Q  Sarah -- and I want to ask two questions on two different things. When it comes to inclusion, what is the President talking about tonight when it's inclusion? Is it about race? Is it about politics? What does this inclusion vision or unity vision include?MS. SANDERS: I think its very clear, the President has made no secret from the campaign trail through the first month in office that his priority is putting Americans first. And when he says Americans, he means all Americans. Hes not specifying breaking it out by demographic. Hes talking about every single American, and I dont think you can be any more clear when it comes to unity than that -- and inclusion.Q  And last question, on HBCUs. Theres no new money in it, but the people who came to the stakeout, who were in the room for the signing, were talking about a promise of more money. Theyve been looking forward to more money from (inaudible) Commerce. What is this next step for them, I guess, to do when it comes to getting more money and this promise beyond what youre already doing trying to bring the agencies together to pinpoint things (inaudible)? What is this promise of hope for money?MS. SANDERS: Im not sure on the specific resources, but I do know that the Presidents priority here is making sure that the HBCUs have a direct line within the White House and not layers of bureaucracy to have to go through. And so that conversation has opened up so that he can be part of that directly. And thats a big part of moving this group back into the White House outside of the Department of Education.Q  So you dont know anything else about --MS. SANDERS: I do know that there have been a lot of different discussions on how that could happen. Some of that is through -- all of the different departments have -- there are quite a few departments -- you would be surprised, not just Department of Education, that actually have funding streams for HBCUs, and figuring out how best to streamline that so that more money goes back to the actual colleges and universities.Jennifer.Q  The Pentagon -- that 30-day report yesterday on defeating ISIS. Can you give us any sort of update on the options presented in that and what the Presidents reaction was?MS. SANDERS: I think the President has been very clear, he never lays out a strategy to defeat an enemy. And thats exactly what he was asked to get back was a strategy and options. And I know that that was presented yesterday.Jim.Q  Did the White House reach out to the Pentagon to see what kind of information could be made public about what intelligence was gathered in that Yemen raid? Do you know if thats something that occurred?MS. SANDERS: I know weve had conversations with people at DOD. I havent been given specifics, but I do know that very clearly it was stated that there was substantial information gathered that was offered. And Im trying to figure -- remember exactly how they phrased it -- but actionable items within that information.Sure, go ahead.Q  Just to follow up on immigration, I know you said the focus is still on border security and deporting criminals. But can we expect the President to actually talk about a call for a broader immigration bill at all in the speech? Or is that just something youre saying hes open to but were not going to hear about it tonight?MS. SANDERS: Again, Im not going to get in front of the Presidents speech tonight, but I do think that you can expect immigration to be mentioned. But Ill let him fill you in on the details of what that actually looks like.Q  Two questions. So first, with regard to the anti-ISIS plan, how much of that can we expect to hear from him tonight? Youre saying that he doesnt want to kind of reveal the game plan, but it could involve boosting troop numbers perhaps. I mean, the American people probably would want to know something like that. So is there anything thats going to hint to that?The second part is, General McMaster has been reported to say that he didnt think that the phrase radical Islamic extremism is helpful, is a useful term. So is the President going to try to kind of tone that down in his speech tonight? Or can we expect to still hear that kind of language used?MS. SANDERS: I know that national security will be a big part of the speech tonight. And again, I dont want to get ahead of that, but I think you can certainly anticipate him addressing national security in depth tonight.Zeke.Q  Thanks, Sarah. A follow-up question about the ISIS review. Sean yesterday promised a -- I guess more information today on the process, who was involved in drafting this review -- not specifics of what was in it. And yesterday, the principals committee, when as it actually brought the President? That's the first one. The second one is, you've spent a lot of time talking about (inaudible) following up on a question earlier. Does the administration hope that the State Department keeps the special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism? Or will the White House sort of commit to keeping that position?MS. SANDERS: Yeah, on the first question in terms of the plan and the specifics, luckily we're not all the way through with today. And its going to be a long day, so we've still got plenty of time to get that information to you. In terms of the second part, Im not clear on the plan for that, but well check and get back to you on it.Q  Just two small, short questions. Do you have anything on this immigration -- about the skilled laborers? For example, H-1B visa. Because there is a group of lawmakers who were in Delhi, and they spoke to Prime Minister Modi who gave -- there is a lot of fear about the H-1B visa being slashed. So do you have anything on that?MS. SANDERS: I don't have any announcements on that right now.Q  And the Indian foreign secretary is in town from today until March 4th. Any meetings scheduled here?MS. SANDERS: Not that Im aware of right now, but Ill check and well get back to you and let you know for sure.Q  Sarah, I was wondering if you have any details on the strike that may have killed Abu al-Khayr al-Masri, the al Qaeda number two?MS. SANDERS: I don't have any comments at all. Not at this time.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sarah. Two brief questions for you. One, in at least two of the televised debates during the Republican presidential nomination, candidate Trump made it clear he was for abolishing the Department of Education. Now he is President, and are there going to be major cutbacks in the Department of Education that have been approved by Secretary DeVos?MS. SANDERS: Im not sure about specific cutbacks. But I do know that there is a heavy emphasis and priority on moving power away from the federal government to the state and local government. And I know that that was one of the topics that was discussed yesterday with a lot of the governors that were in town. Specifically that topic came up. And I think you can look for ways that well start moving power from the federal government to state and local governments where they're closer to education decisions. But as far as specific plans, I couldnt speak to that today.Q  So its phasing out the department rather than abolishing?MS. SANDERS: I did not say that we were phasing out the department. I said we were moving power away from the federal government to state and local governments. But as far as specifics go, Im sure well be getting to those over the next couple of months.Q  My other question is --MS. SANDERS: Sean set me up for the take two here. (Laughter.)Q  The Islamic Resistance Council, one of the best-known groups in opposition to the government in Tehran, recently released documents saying the Quds Force, the Elite Revolutionary Guards in Iran have an extra-territorial division now that is fomenting violence in other countries, including Yemen, Iraq, and Syria. Is the administration aware of this? And does it have any comment on it?MS. SANDERS: That's a question I would refer to the NSC, instead of through us.Q  In his Fox interview, the President said this morning, ""We will be putting out a replacement plan for Obamacare. Who is ""we""?MS. SANDERS: Well, I think its no secret hes been spending a lot of time working with members of Congress, his HHS Secretary, Secretary Price, himself. And again, hes had countless meetings over the first few weeks in office with a lot of people that have major influence and major impact, and that a repeal-and-replace plan would impact a lot. So I think its a collective thing. But primarily the President, the Department of HHS, and Congress.Q  Will that be one plan? Or is it going to be a White House plan and a congressional plan?MS. SANDERS: I don't think we're ready to make that full announcement today, but I definitely know that its a collective process that we've been working through.Jim.Q  Just to follow up on that question: Has there been some warmth shown to the Speakers office and to the House Republican proposal? That's what we're hearing from sources up on the Hill, that they're feeling a little bit better about the way the President is receiving their proposals for repealing and replacing Obamacare.MS. SANDERS: Look, we -- absolutely, this President is very clear he wants to work with Congress. And we want to make sure that we have the best plan possible. And I think that requires that all of us come together and work together to make sure we get that. And that's exactly what we've been doing.Q  Can I just follow on that, Sarah? There are a variety of House Republicans who know that the working draft is dead in the House -- among Republicans for ACA repeal and replace. And their question is whether they're going to hear from the President something more specific that will help give them cover and lead them forward on ACA, publicly. So my question to you is: What is he going to say that might be in the vein that they're talking about -- leading, giving them cover, and describing something in more detail than Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced?MS. SANDERS: Again, Im not going to get ahead of the Presidents speech tonight. But I do know that he will address Obamacare. Hell talk about some of his priorities for the plan, and Ill let him speak to that later this evening.Q  Can I also ask -- Sean said yesterday we could expect a new immigration, travel EO by midweek. Is that still operable?MS. SANDERS: I would say that's pretty likely. Francesca.Q  Thank you, Sarah. The White House, Im wondering, if you have a strategy for who is sitting with the President -- or rather with the First Lady in the box -- for instance, Democrats are purposefully bringing DREAMers, they're purposefully brining Muslims to show their opposition to some of the Presidents strategy. So what is the White Houses message with the people that are sitting in the Presidents box?MS. SANDERS: I think the primary reason that a lot of times you have people in the box are they're -- that highlight specific parts of the speech and specific parts of the agenda. And I think you can see the people sitting with him. Its pretty obvious the reason that most of them are there. And hes laid out those priorities since day one of his administration. And so I think its pretty self-explanatory there, Francesca.Jordan.Q  Thanks, Sarah. The Presidents budget -- even though its not complete yet -- has already been running into some significant resistance among Senate Republicans. Senator McConnell is out there criticizing the State Department cuts. Senator Graham said it was dead on arrival. So I just want to know what the White House is doing to talk to these members, maybe assuage their concerns. Can you give us a picture whats going on behind the scenes to get support for that document before it comes out?MS. SANDERS: Sure. I mean, the President met with Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell earlier this week to talk about some of those priorities. But again, this isnt a final budget. Its a draft, and the whole point of it is to receive feedback, work together, and put the best budget forward possible.And that's exactly what process we're in right now. Director Mulvaney is focused on doing that. And I know hes got a lot of colleagues in the House and Senate, and hell be speaking with a lot of those people over the coming weeks as we lead up to rolling out our budget.Q  Sarah, the President said he believes that former President Barack Obama is secretly behind these waves of protests that have been coming up these last few weeks. What tangible evidence is President Trump basing this on? And when was the last time the two spoke?MS. SANDERS: Ill let the Presidents comments on that stand for itself. And Im not sure on the last time they spoke. Id have to check on that and get back to you.Q  But does the White House believe that President Obama and his people -- like the President is suggesting -- are behind these protests?MS. SANDERS: Look, I think the bottom line here is that we've all condemned the protests. I think that that's the bigger story here. And the focus that we should be talking about is that this isnt something that helps and moves us forward. And that's what we're focused on right now.Q  Two questions -- one is on immigration. MS. SANDERS: The topic of the day.Q  In 2014, President Trump, then-citizen Trump, spoke to CPAC and said that he thought immigration in the long term, if there was an immigration reform bill, that it would be a loser for the Republican Party; that the people who could be naturalized through the process would only vote for Democrats. Has the President come to a different political calculation that if there is a pathway to citizenship for people here illegally, that they could eventually vote for Republicans?MS. SANDERS: Again, I havent had the chance to talk with the President about this specific policy that we've now asked about multiple times. But well try to do that and get something to you guys in the next -- Q  Does the President think that human exploration is something that is important for the -- human space exploration is something thats important for the country to invest in, in the future?MS. SANDERS: Im not sure if I would say that its a top priority. But I know its something that's certainly been discussed.Thanks, guys. We look forward to the speech tonight, and well get you some more details.Q  (Inaudible) tonight?Hopefully well have some more information to lay out for you guys later this afternoon. Thanks.END3:33 P.M. EST",20812.24,-25.19999999999709,5825.44,-36.460000000000036,2363.64,-6.110000000000127
233,2017-02-28,Remarks by President Trump in Joint Address to Congress,"U.S. CapitolWashington, D.C.9:09 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States -- (applause) -- and citizens of America:Tonight, as we mark the conclusion of our celebration of Black History Month, we are reminded of our nation's path towards civil rights and the work that still remains to be done. (Applause.) Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. (Applause.)Each American generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present. That torch is now in our hands. And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. A new chapter -- (applause) -- of American Greatness is now beginning. A new national pride is sweeping across our nation. And a new surge of optimism is placing impossible dreams firmly within our grasp.What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit. Our allies will find that America is once again ready to lead. (Applause.) All the nations of the world -- friend or foe -- will find that America is strong, America is proud, and America is free.In nine years, the United States will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding -- 250 years since the day we declared our independence. It will be one of the great milestones in the history of the world. But what will America look like as we reach our 250th year? What kind of country will we leave for our children?I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades past to define the course of our future. For too long, we've watched our middle class shrink as we've exported our jobs and wealth to foreign countries. We've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, and so many other places throughout our land.We've defended the borders of other nations while leaving our own borders wide open for anyone to cross and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate. And we've spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.Then, in 2016, the Earth shifted beneath our feet. The rebellion started as a quiet protest, spoken by families of all colors and creeds -- families who just wanted a fair shot for their children and a fair hearing for their concerns.But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country. Finally, the chorus became an earthquake, and the people turned out by the tens of millions, and they were all united by one very simple, but crucial demand: that America must put its own citizens first. Because only then can we truly make America great again. (Applause.)Dying industries will come roaring back to life. Heroic veterans will get the care they so desperately need. Our military will be given the resources its brave warriors so richly deserve. Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and railways gleaming across our very, very beautiful land. Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and, ultimately, stop. And our neglected inner cities will see a rebirth of hope, safety and opportunity. Above all else, we will keep our promises to the American people. (Applause.)It's been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I've made in keeping those promises.Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions and billions of dollars in the United States, and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs. (Applause.)The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion in value since the election on November 8th, a record. We've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of a fantastic -- and it is a fantastic -- new F-35 jet fighter, and we'll be saving billions more on contracts all across our government. We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.We have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials and a lifetime ban -- (applause) -- thank you -- and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.We have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency. (Applause.) And were imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. (Applause.) Were going to stop the regulations that threaten the future and livelihood of our great coal miners. (Applause.)We have cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines -- (applause) -- thereby creating tens of thousands of jobs. And I've issued a new directive that new American pipelines be made with American steel. (Applause.)We have withdrawn the United States from the job-killing Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Applause.) And with the help of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams. (Applause.)To protect our citizens, I have directed the Department of Justice to form a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime. I have further ordered the Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, along with the Department of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread all across our nation. (Applause.) We will stop the drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth, and we will expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted. (Applause.)At the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the American people for immigration enforcement and border security. (Applause.) By finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions and billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. (Applause.) We want all Americans to succeed, but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. We must restore integrity and the rule of law at our borders. (Applause.)For that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border. (Applause.) As we speak tonight, we are removing gang members, drug dealers, and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our very innocent citizens. Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as I promised throughout the campaign.To any in Congress who do not believe we should enforce our laws, I would ask you this one question: What would you say to the American family that loses their jobs, their income, or their loved one because America refused to uphold its laws and defend its borders? (Applause.)Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States. We are also taking strong measures to protect our nation from radical Islamic terrorism. (Applause.) According to data provided by the Department of Justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. We have seen the attacks at home -- from Boston to San Bernardino to the Pentagon, and, yes, even the World Trade Center.We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium, in Germany, and all over the world. It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. (Applause.) Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America. We cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. (Applause.)That is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe and to keep out those out who will do us harm. (Applause.)As promised, I directed the Department of Defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy ISIS -- a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians, and men, and women, and children of all faiths and all beliefs. We will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the Muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet. (Applause.)I have also imposed new sanctions on entities and individuals who support Iran's ballistic missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable alliance with the State of Israel. (Applause.)Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the United States Supreme Court, from my list of 20 judges, who will defend our Constitution. (Applause.) I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia with us in the gallery tonight. (Applause.) Thank you, Maureen. Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will forever be a symbol of American justice. To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep devotion to the law. He was confirmed unanimously by the Court of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to swiftly approve his nomination. (Applause.)Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge the circumstances we inherited. Ninety-four million Americans are out of the labor force. Over 43 million people are now living in poverty, and over 43 million Americans are on food stamps. More than one in five people in their prime working years are not working. We have the worst financial recovery in 65 years. In the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all of the other Presidents combined.We've lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we've lost 60,000 factories since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion dollars. And overseas we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.Solving these and so many other pressing problems will require us to work past the differences of party. It will require us to tap into the American spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history. But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the American economy -- making it easier for companies to do business in the United States, and much, much harder for companies to leave our country. (Applause.)Right now, American companies are taxed at one of the highest rates anywhere in the world. My economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. (Applause.) It will be a big, big cut. At the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class. We must create a level playing field for American companies and our workers. We have to do it. (Applause.) Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes. But when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing, or almost nothing.I just met with officials and workers from a great American company, Harley-Davidson. In fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA, on the front lawn of the White House. ((Laughter and applause.) And they wanted me to ride one and I said, ""No, thank you."" (Laughter.)At our meeting, I asked them, how are you doing, how is business? They said that it's good. I asked them further, how are you doing with other countries, mainly international sales? They told me -- without even complaining, because they have been so mistreated for so long that they've become used to it -- that it's very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. They said that in the case of another country, they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent. They weren't even asking for a change. But I am. (Applause.)I believe strongly in free trade but it also has to be fair trade. It's been a long time since we had fair trade. The first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned that the ""abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people."" Lincoln was right -- and it's time we heeded his advice and his words. (Applause.) I am not going to let America and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of us any longer. They have taken advantage of our country. No longer. (Applause.)I am going to bring back millions of jobs. Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. (Applause.) The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers. Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia and many others, have a merit-based immigration system. (Applause.) It's a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. According to the National Academy of Sciences, our current immigration system costs American taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.Switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, we will have so many more benefits. It will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families -- including immigrant families -- enter the middle class. And they will do it quickly, and they will be very, very happy, indeed. (Applause.)I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: To improve jobs and wages for Americans; to strengthen our nation's security; and to restore respect for our laws. If we are guided by the wellbeing of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades. (Applause.)Another Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, initiated the last truly great national infrastructure program -- the building of the Interstate Highway System. The time has come for a new program of national rebuilding. (Applause.)America has spent approximately $6 trillion in the Middle East -- all the while our infrastructure at home is crumbling. With this $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice, and maybe even three times if we had people who had the ability to negotiate. (Applause.)To launch our national rebuilding, I will be asking Congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in infrastructure of the United States -- financed through both public and private capital -- creating millions of new jobs. (Applause.) This effort will be guided by two core principles: buy American and hire American. (Applause.)Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare -- (applause) -- with reforms that expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time, provide better healthcare. (Applause.)Mandating every American to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for our country. (Applause.) The way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we are going do. (Applause.)Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said Obamacare is failing in his state -- the state of Kentucky -- and it's unsustainable and collapsing.One-third of counties have only one insurer, and they are losing them fast. They are losing them so fast. They are leaving, and many Americans have no choice at all. Theres no choice left. Remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor and keep your plan? We now know that all of those promises have been totally broken.  Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisively to protect all Americans. (Applause.)Action is not a choice, it is a necessity. So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans in Congress to work with us to save Americans from this imploding Obamacare disaster. (Applause.)Here are the principles that should guide the Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans:First, we should ensure that Americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. (Applause.)Secondly, we should help Americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded Health Savings Accounts -- but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by our government. (Applause.)Thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out. (Applause.)Fourth, we should implement legal reforms that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary costs that drive up the price of insurance, and work to bring down the artificially high price of drugs, and bring them down immediately. (Applause.)And finally, the time has come to give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines -- (applause) -- which will create a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring costs way down and provide far better care. So important.Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed. Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope.Our citizens deserve this, and so much more -- so why not join forces and finally get the job done, and get it done right? (Applause.) On this and so many other things, Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country and for the good of the American people. (Applause.)My administration wants to work with members of both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents that they have paid family leave -- (applause) -- to invest in women's health, and to promote clean air and clean water, and to rebuild our military and our infrastructure. (Applause.)True love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every American child who deserves a much brighter future.An incredible young woman is with us this evening, who should serve as an inspiration to us all. Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us in the gallery is a rare disease survivor, Megan Crowley. (Applause.) Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a rare and serious illness, when she was 15 months old. She was not expected to live past five. On receiving this news, Megan's dad, John, fought with everything he had to save the life of his precious child. He founded a company to look for a cure, and helped develop the drug that saved Megan's life. Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore at Notre Dame. (Applause.)Megan's story is about the unbounded power of a father's love for a daughter. But our slow and burdensome approval process at the Food and Drug Administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved Megan's life, from reaching those in need. If we slash the restraints, not just at the FDA but across our government, then we will be blessed with far more miracles just like Megan. (Applause.) In fact, our children will grow up in a nation of miracles.But to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind and the souls of every American child. Education is the civil rights issue of our time. (Applause.) I am calling upon members of both parties to pass an education bill that funds school choice for disadvantaged youth, including millions of African American and Latino children. (Applause.) These families should be free to choose the public, private, charter, magnet, religious, or home school that is right for them. (Applause.)Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, Denisha Merriweather. As a young girl, Denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. But then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning -- a great learning center -- with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship program. Today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. Later this year she will get her masters degree in social work. We want all children to be able to break the cycle of poverty just like Denisha. (Applause.)But to break the cycle of poverty, we must also break the cycle of violence. The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest single-year increase in nearly half a century. In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone, and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher. This is not acceptable in our society. (Applause.)Every American child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job. (Applause.) But to create this future, we must work with, not against -- not against -- the men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.) We must build bridges of cooperation and trust -- not drive the wedge of disunity and, really, it's what it is, division. It's pure, unadulterated division. We have to unify. Police and sheriffs are members of our community. They're friends and neighbors, they're mothers and fathers, sons and daughters -- and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry about whether or not they'll come home safe and sound. We must support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. (Applause.)And we must support the victims of crime. I have ordered the Department of Homeland Security to create an office to serve American victims. The office is called VOICE -- Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our media and silenced by special interests. (Applause.) Joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave Americans whose government failed them. Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver, Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.Jamiel's 17-year-old son was viciously murdered by an illegal immigrant gang member who had just been released from prison. Jamiel Shaw, Jr. was an incredible young man, with unlimited potential who was getting ready to go to college where he would have excelled as a great college quarterback. But he never got the chance. His father, who is in the audience tonight, has become a very good friend of mine. Jamiel, thank you. Thank you. (Applause.)Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica Davis. Their husbands, Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver and Detective Michael Davis, were slain in the line of duty in California. They were pillars of their community. These brave men were viciously gunned down by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. Should have never been in our country.Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna. Jenna, I want you to know that your father was a hero, and that tonight you have the love of an entire country supporting you and praying for you. (Applause.)To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want you to know that we will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten. We will always honor their memory. (Applause.)Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide the men and women of the United States military with the tools they need to prevent war -- if they must -- they have to fight and they only have to win. (Applause.)I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds the military, eliminates the defense sequester -- (applause) -- and calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history. My budget will also increase funding for our veterans. Our veterans have delivered for this nation, and now we must deliver for them. (Applause.)The challenges we face as a nation are great, but our people are even greater. And none are greater or braver than those who fight for America in uniform. (Applause.) We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy Special Operator, Senior Chief William ""Ryan"" Owens. Ryan died as he lived: a warrior and a hero, battling against terrorism and securing our nation. (Applause.) I just spoke to our great General Mattis, just now, who reconfirmed that -- and I quote -- ""Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies."" Ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. Thank you. (Applause.) And Ryan is looking down, right now -- you know that -- and he is very happy because I think he just broke a record. (Laughter and applause.)For as the Bible teaches us, ""There is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends."" Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan. (Applause.)To those allies who wonder what kind of a friend America will be, look no further than the heroes who wear our uniform. Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies all across the globe.We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a Cold War, and defeated communism. (Applause.)But our partners must meet their financial obligations. And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that. In fact, I can tell you, the money is pouring in. Very nice. (Applause.) We expect our partners -- whether in NATO, the Middle East, or in the Pacific -- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost. Have to do that.We will respect historic institutions, but we will respect the foreign rights of all nations, and they have to respect our rights as a nation also. (Applause.) Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people, and America respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. My job is not to represent the world. My job is to represent the United States of America. (Applause.) But we know that America is better off when there is less conflict, not more. We must learn from the mistakes of the past. We have seen the war and the destruction that have ravaged and raged throughout the world -- all across the world. The only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters, in many cases, is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long, long process of rebuilding. (Applause.)America is willing to find new friends, and to forge new partnerships, where shared interests align. We want harmony and stability, not war and conflict. We want peace, wherever peace can be found. America is friends today with former enemies. Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible wars. This history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world. Hopefully, the 250th year for America will see a world that is more peaceful, more just, and more free.On our 100th anniversary, in 1876, citizens from across our nation came to Philadelphia to celebrate America's centennial. At that celebration, the country's builders and artists and inventors showed off their wonderful creations. Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone for the first time. Remington unveiled the first typewriter. An early attempt was made at electric light. Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen. Imagine the wonders our country could know in America's 250th year. (Applause.)Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people. Cures to the illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope. American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear, schools where children learn in peace, and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask. (Applause.)When we have all of this, we will have made America greater than ever before -- for all Americans. This is our vision. This is our mission. But we can only get there together. We are one people, with one destiny. We all bleed the same blood. We all salute the same great American flag. And we all are made by the same God. (Applause.)When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will look back on tonight as when this new chapter of American Greatness began. The time for small thinking is over. The time for trivial fights is behind us. We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence to turn those hopes and those dreams into action.From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears; inspired by the future, not bound by the failures of the past; and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts. I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal of the American spirit. I am asking all members of Congress to join me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things for our country. I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize this moment.

The Nation's more than 100 HBCUs are located in 20 States, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and serve more than 300,000 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. These institutions are important engines of economic growth and public service, and they are proven ladders of intergenerational advancement.A White House Initiative on HBCUs would: advance America's full human potential; foster more and better opportunities in higher education; strengthen the capacity of HBCUs to provide the highest-quality education; provide equitable opportunities for HBCUs to participate in Federal programs; and increase the number of college-educated Americans who feel empowered and able to advance the common good at home and abroad.Sec. 2.

So thank you all for being here today.President Trump used to say on the campaign trail that he had a three-part agenda for the American economy: Jobs, jobs, and jobs. And with Wilbur Ross as our new Secretary of Commerce, the President and I are confident that the Department of Commerce is going to take its right and leading role in fostering the growth that will create good-paying jobs for every American.And, Wilbur, youre well-suited for this task. You established yourself as a leading American businessman in a career that spans over 40 years -- incredible number of fields and industries. You understand the American economy because you've participated in so many different parts of it with such great success. From steel to textiles, from energy to manufacturing, you have firsthand experience with the building blocks of the American economy. You've also seen for yourself the struggles that American workers can face in difficult times. And your stewardship of companies -- one after another -- have time and again saved thousands of jobs and put those companies and firms in a position to survive and thrive in the years ahead. It is a credit to your ability and to your dedication to the American worker.Now President Trump has called on you to serve your country as Secretary of Commerce. And given your decades of experience, your record of leadership, your integrity, and your commitment to protecting Americas economic future, President Trump and I have full confidence that you will succeed.

240,2017-02-28,Remarks by President Trump at Signing of Waters of the United States (WOTUS) Executive Order,"Roosevelt Room2:23 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, everybody. We appreciate you being here. Thank you very much. First of all, I want to congratulate Scott Pruitt, who's here someplace. Where's Scott? (Applause.) So important. We're going to free up our country, and it's going be done in a very environmental and positive environmental way, I will tell you that, but create millions of jobs. So many jobs are delayed for so many years, and it's unfair to everybody. So I want congratulate Scott.I want to thank everyone for being here today. We have a great group of farmers, homebuilders, and county commissioners. They're all represented. They're standing alongside of me. Id also like to thank Jim Inhofe, who's been so terrific in so many different ways, beyond even this. So I want thank Jim and also the leadership in the Senate on the issue, a friend of mine -- a great friend of mine -- John Barrasso.The EPAs so-called Waters of the United States rule is one of the worst examples of federal regulation, and it has truly run amok, and is one of the rules most strongly opposed by farmers, ranchers and agricultural workers all across our land. It's prohibiting them from being allowed to do what they're supposed to be doing. It's been a disaster.The Clean Water Act says that the EPA can regulate navigable waters -- meaning waters that truly affect interstate commerce. But a few years ago, the EPA decided that navigable waters can mean nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmer's land, or anyplace else that they decide -- right? It was a massive power grab. The EPAs regulators were putting people out of jobs by the hundreds of thousands, and regulations and permits started treating our wonderful small farmers and small businesses as if they were a major industrial polluter. They treated them horribly. Horribly.If you want to build a new home, for example, you have to worry about getting hit with a huge fine if you fill in as much as a puddle -- just a puddle -- on your lot. I've seen it. In fact, when it was first shown to me, I said, no, you're kidding arent you? But they werent kidding.In one case in a Wyoming, a rancher was fined $37,000 a day by the EPA for digging a small watering hole for his cattle. His land. These abuses were, and are, why such incredible opposition to this rule from the hundreds of organizations took place in all 50 states. It's a horrible, horrible rule. Has sort of a nice name, but everything else is bad. (Laughter.) I've been hearing about it for years and years. I didnt know I'd necessarily be in this position to do something about it, but we've been hearing about it for years.With todays executive order, Im directing the EPA to take action, paving the way for the elimination of this very destructive and horrible rule.So I want to thank everybody for being here.

Please share this with policy officials in your agency.Adherence to the requirements ofthe clearance process serves the needs ofthe President by ensuring that agency legislative proposals and recommendations, as well as testimony, are consistent with his policies and programs. We request that agency legislative proposals, letters, and testimony discussing or involving legislation be submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as far in advance ofa needed clearance as feasible.OMB runs a clearance process on these items, which requires sufficient time to review and coordinate with all relevant agencies, and offices in the Executive Office ofthe President.OMB Circular No. A-19 details the requirements and procedures for legislative coordination and clearance. The attachment summarizes the major elements and the essential purposes ofthe clearance process.We will be working with you to ensure the timely transmittal to Congress of legislative proposals necessary to support the President's legislative agenda and the Fiscal Year 2018 Budget. As decisions are made on these matters, we will be in contact about details related to the drafting, review, and clearance ofthese proposals.Thank you for your cooperation.THE LEGISLATIVE CLEARANCE FUNCTIONThis paper summarizes the major elements of the legislative clearance function that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), working with other offices in the Executive Office ofthe President (EOP) and with the agencies, carries out on behalf of the President.BackgroundThe President's legislative responsibilities are founded in his constitutional duties and powers. In executing his executive duties, the President generally outlines legislative recommendations through the Inaugural address, State ofthe Union address, Budget, Economic Report, and other communications. The compilation ofthese recommendations constitutes the President's Program. In supporting the President's Program, agencies within the Administration: (1) submit to the Congress legislative proposals needed to carry out the President's Program; (2) convey the Administration's views on legislation that the Congress has under consideration; and(3) recommend approval or disapproval ofbills passed by the Congress.OMB's legislative clearance function allows for all affected agencies to engage and reconcile differences on legislative proposals and communications that are cleared and transmitted to the Congress. The primary goals of the clearance process are to ensure that: (1) agencies' legislative communications with Congress are consistent with the President's policies and objectives; and(2) the Administration ""speaks with one voice"" regarding legislation. During clearance, OMB circulates items to affected agencies and EOP offices for their review, and ensures that all issues are resolved before providing final clearance to the transmitting agency.Items that are Subject to the Clearance ProcessLegislative Proposals -All draft legislation that Executive branch agencies wish to transmit to the Congress must be sent to OMB for clearance. OMB circulates the draft bills, along with any other supporting documents, to affected agencies and appropriate EOP offices.Any agency reviewing a draft bill may respond that it: (1) supports or has no objection to the draft bill; or (2) proposes substantive or technical amendments, or even a complete substitute. OMB facilitates reconciliation ofdivergent views. Most disagreements are resolved through discussions at the staff level by OMB, other EOP offices, and the agencies.After obtaining appropriate policy guidance on a draft bill and resolving all issues, OMB advises the proposing agency ofclearance. OMB directs the originating agency to convey the draft bill, a transmittal letter, and a sectional analysis to the Congress. Ifthe draft bill is contrary to or conflicts with the Administration's objectives, clearance is withheld and OMB advises the proposing agency that it may not transmit the bill.Testimony and Letters on Pending Legislation -Congressional committees often invite agency officials to testify on pending legislation on behalf ofthe Administration, or request that agencies submit their views through a letter. Agencies may also choose to submit a letter on pending legislation without a congressional request. Such testimonies and letters must be submitted toOMB for clearance. OMB circulates legislative testimonies and letters to affected agencies fortheir review and resolves of any issues.Other Legislative Communications -All transmittals to Congress communicating legislative views or recommendations must be submitted to OMB for clearance. In addition to testimonies and letters, an agency may communicate in another form, such as submitting talking points to convey comments (often informally) on a bill under consideration by Congress, or responding to questions for the record following a congressional hearing. Also, agencies have numerous requirements to submit certain reports to Congress, and reports that contain any legislative views or recommendations must be submitted to OMB for clearance.Statements ofAdministration Policy (SAPs) -SAPs allow the Administration to state publicly its views on legislation for the record. Generally, the House releases a weekly schedule that provides notice ofbills that will be considered the following week. The Senate schedule is ascertained informally. OMB coordinates with lead agencies and other EOP entities to prepare SAPs. Once drafted, SAPs are circulated to agencies for review and comment. Once cleared, a SAP is sent to the Congress by OMB's Legislative Affairs Office, and OMB publishes the SAP on its public website. Due to the timing between the notice and congressional action, SAPs are often cleared under tight time constraints. Agencies should anticipate hard deadlines on SAP review requests.Enrolled Bills -Once a bill passes the House and Senate it is then enrolled and sent to the President for action --either approval or disapproval. With regard to the timing ofpresidential action, the Constitution permits the President ten days from receipt ofthe enrolled bill to take action (including holidays but excluding Sundays). This ten-day clock begins on the day after the bill is received.To assist the President in deciding his course of action on a bill, OMB requests that each stakeholder agency submit its recommendation for the President's action on the bill. OMB requests a formal views letter from the lead agency or agencies. This letter must be signed by the head ofthe agency or another Presidential appointee. All formal enrolled bill views letters must specifically provide a recommendation as to whether the President should approve/sign or disapprove/veto the enrolled bill. OMB also requests views from other affected agencies, which may be provided informally.

244,2017-02-28,Remarks by President Trump at Signing of H.R. 321 and H.R. 255,"Oval Office2:11 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you all very much. I appreciate you being here. We have a number of bills that we're signing and things that we're doing today. It's a busy day. And then I guess tonight will be a rather busy night. We look forward to it.I want to thank Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has been a tremendous friend to a lot of people. He's done an amazing job. And, Kevin, I want to thank you for being here. I very much appreciate it. You had so much to do with this.I also want to thank everyone else who's with us today. In fact, I have some names, and I'll read some of them off, because not everybody knows everybody. But we have Leader McCarthy. Representative Barbara Comstock. Lamar Smith -- thank you, Lamar, very much. I appreciate it. Joni Ernst, who's been a terrific, terrific senator. A very talented woman, and a very good military person. A very good military person. And, Deb Fischer, thank you very much. Thanks. We also have Senator Barrasso and Senator Boozman. Joni, we said hello. Deb, we said hello. Heidi Heitkamp -- thank you, Heidi. Senator Jim Inhofe. Senator Pat Roberts. Senator Dan Sullivan. Representative Bob Gibbs. Bill Shuster. And Representative Lamar Smith. We really appreciate you being here.Of course, we have our new SBA Director, Linda McMahon, and Secretary DeVos. (Applause.) So we have a lot of great talent. Today I'm signing two bills that promote women entering and leading the STEM fields -- science, technology, engineering, and math. Currently, only 1 in every 4 women who gets a STEM degree is working in a STEM job, which is not fair and it's not even smart for the people that arent taking advantage of it. It's unacceptable that we have so many American women who have these degrees but yet are not being employed in these fields. So I think that's going to change. That's going to change very rapidly. Protecting women with STEM degrees, and all Americans withSTEM degrees is very important, but it also means you have to crack down on offshoring, because the offshoring is a tremendous problem that displaces many of our best American workers and brains -- the brain power. So I just want to thank you all for being here. Vice President Pence always felt very, very strongly about this issue and many others. And I appreciate -- Mike, I appreciate that very much.And I'm going to sign this right now, and I want congratulate everybody in the room. And we have to sign it today. I know we have a lot of things coming on later on, but if we dont sign this one and the next one today, we have to start the process all over again, Joni, right? (Laughter.) So that's why we're here.Okay, thank you very much. (Applause.)  Q  Big speech tonight?THE PRESIDENT: We look forward to it. Okay, I think we all know what this is. Even though somebody took my notes, it makes no difference. (Laughter.) AIDE: It's the second bill you just read.THE PRESIDENT: It really makes no difference. But this is the second bill that was signed, and that's the H.R. 321, the INSPIRE Women Act. It ensures that the existing NASA programs recruit women to STEM-related jobs and aerospace careers. Great news. Really the way to go. Very heavy into the whole NASA situation. So women will be a big, big part of it. H.R. 255, the Promoting Women in Entrepreneurship Act, enables the National Science Foundation to support women inventors -- which there are many -- researchers, and scientists in bringing their discoveries to the business world, championing science and entrepreneurship, and creating new ways to improve peoples lives. So important.We need policies that help support women in the workforce, and that's really very much going to be addressed by my administration over the years, and to get more and more of these bills coming out, and address the barriers faced by female and those in STEM fields. We want American women who graduate from college with STEM degrees to be able to get STEM jobs that can support their families and help these American women to live out the American Dream, which they are so qualified to live out. So again, I want to thank you all for being here. Fantastic. This is so important. Thank you all for being here.END2:17 P.M.

246,2017-03-01,"Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 3/1/2017","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room11:40 A.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Hi, guys. I'm going to try to keep this relatively short. We got a few things going on today, and I know that the pool has got to get out to do a spray at some point soon with the lunch. So, obviously, last night was a big night for the President and for everyone here at the White House. The President delivered a powerful statement to Congress, to Americans, and the world last night. It was an optimistic, forward-looking message of unity, strength, straight from his heart. The President was proud to stand before the American people last night and present his roadmap for a renewal of the American spirit. He honestly and -- he honestly acknowledged the undeniable challenges that we face, but continually reminded us there's no challenge facing this country that we can't meet if we join together.The American spirit has already proven itself against seemingly insurmountable odds, and we'll do it again under the leadership of this President.Republicans and Democrats may be divided on policies, but we're also united in our mission to achieve peace and prosperity for every American citizen. The President has obviously been humbled by the great reception that the -- the reception that his address received. Today, the President is holding a series of meetings with White House staff, congressional leaders, and others to drive the goals that he laid out last night.He'll host shortly a leadership lunch with House and Senate Republican leadership. The attendees will include the Vice President, Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Senator Cornyn, Leader McCarthy, Congressman Scalise, Senator Gardiner and Senator Perdue.Last night's address clearly generated a lot of momentum, and the President is anxious to continue working on an ambitious legislative agenda. During his speech last night, the President mentioned policies in key areas, from urban renewal to trade reform, where too many leading agencies and departments in charge of implementing are still waiting on their confirmed leaders. The President was pleased, obviously, to see that Ryan Zinke was confirmed as the Secretary of the Interior by the Senate just a short time ago. So the confirmation process is now coming to an end for him, and start to get the work going. As the President mentioned in last night's remarks -- and, by the way, one quick note, we'll have an update on his swearing-in hopefully soon. As the President mentioned in last night's remarks, he's calling on Congress to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a patient-focused system that expands options, lowers costs, and improves healthcare outcomes for all Americans. He's ready to restart the honest engine -- to restart the engine of the American economy, which means tax reform that brings down rates for the middle class and simplifies the tax code, a robust infrastructure program and a budget that puts the interests of American people first. The President and congressional leaders will work together today to continue to chart a path forward on those issues and more. Also, today, Judge Neil Gorsuch will be back up on the Hill meeting with seven senators, including Senators Booker, Sanders, Barrasso and Kaine. And lastly, this evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary Tillerson.Looking ahead, I know Sarah was kind enough to come brief you yesterday about the President's trip to Hampton Roads tomorrow. I'll have a few more details for you on that. The President is looking forward to meeting with the members of the Navy and some of the sailors down there, the shipbuilders, including the lead shipbuilder of the USS Gerald Ford and the ship's commander, before giving remarks on deck to a group of shipbuilders and sailors.On Friday, the President will be in Orlando, Florida for a series of important events highlighting his educational agenda. He'll be visiting St. Andrews Catholic School, where I think you can expect him to drop in on a few lucky classrooms, as well as meeting with parents, teachers, and administrators. Education, as was noted last night from the President, is a top priority. He has said many times before that education has the ability to level the playing field for the next generation. Obviously, last night he noted that he believes this is the civil rights issue of this generation. He is determined to provide choice for every parent, and opportunities for every child, regardless of their zip code. I expect he will be speaking with the parents and teachers and administrators at St. Andrews on his upcoming plans for reaching that goal.And finally, I want to note that the President is monitoring the situation in the Midwest, where a string of tornadoes is devastating several states with more severe weather predicted for the coming states -- for the coming days. Three lives have already been tragically cut short. The families of those victims and also those who have had their homes and property destroyed are in the President's thoughts and prayers. The millions of people in the path of severe weather will be at the top of his mind over the next few days. He implores everyone to follow the directions of emergency services and stay inside, and obviously will continue to be in contact with state and local officials to provide the necessary federal support that is required.With that, I'm glad to take some questions.Q  On the lunch today, was it always --MR. SPICER: John Roberts. (Laughter.) Q  -- was it always just going to be Republican leadership? Were the Democrats ever invited? Will he meet with the Democrats?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I'm sure he will. And you've seen he's met with a bipartisan group of Senate leaders last week. He met with a bipartisan group of attorney general yesterday. He met with the bipartisan group of governors. I mean, just to be factual here, at some point, the people who set the agenda and the timetable to enact his agenda are Republican, and so there's a difference between meeting with both sides of the aisle, and I think he has pretty well shown a desire to reach across the aisle in the last month. But this is about actually charting out the agenda and the timeline, and thats why its both groups. But yeah, I think you'll continue to see not just -- in the next week, not just leadership but rank-and-file members of the House and the Senate with that aim.Q  Sean, the Dow Jones crossed 21,000 for the first time today.MR. SPICER: It did.Q  Does the White House believe that thats a reaction to the Presidents speech last night?MR. SPICER: (Laughter.) Look, Im not an economist. I dont want to -- I know the Dow goes up and down, as well as the other indexes, and I dont want to get in the habit of commenting every time the Dow hits. But I think that youve seen a sustained economic boon since the President was elected. He commented on it last night. I think youre seeing not just the Dow react, but manufacturers, business leaders, folks from small and large companies talk about it. And I think that there is a renewed sense of wanting to business, and of economic growth and optimism. Youve seen it in not just in the indexes on a day-to-day basis as they go up and down, but also in the confidence numbers that show that there is a continued growth in the confidence in our economy and our market and our policies. Look, I dont want to tie a direct link. I think that thats -- you know, we could go back and forth every day about where the market stands at any given time in a day. But I would have to believe that when you talk to a lot of economists, they -- and frankly, not just the economists who look at it academically and try to parse it, but when you talk to these company CEOs and leaders that hes talking to, there is a renewed sense of confidence in their country, in the agenda, in the desire to hire and grow and expand in the United States, and I can only see that as a positive sign, not just for the market, but for our entire economy.Q  How long -- to follow up on that -- how long does the President think he can wait in order to provide specifics on tax reform and Obamacare and the others before we start to lose that sense of momentum and confidence that youre talking about in the markets?MR. SPICER: Well, I think its not just those pieces. Obviously, its bigger than just that. But I think that, with respect to Obamacare, he's talked about the next few weeks having something out there, and then same with tax reform. And I think both of those things that we'll be working with the Hill. Secretary Mnuchin mentioned the other day that hopefully having a tax plan done by (inaudible).But both of those, specifically, are massive undertakings. And the idea that they are going to be done in two seconds is a little bit of a fallacy, and I think that weve given folks updates and guidelines as far as when we see this thing moving. And I think that thats a pretty good guide of where we go.Jim Stinson.Q  Sean, Governor Beshear said on Morning Joe today -- Im paraphrasing -- that people are going to die if GOP healthcare plans more forward. What does the administration say to Democrats suggesting Obamacare repeal will cost American lives?MR. SPICER: Well, I would suggest to the former governor that, when you look at where Obamacare stands right now -- I think Ive mentioned this before, Jim -- but more and more people are facing higher and higher premiums. People are choosing to opt out of the exchange and pay the penalty. It is collapsing on its own.And I dont -- I think that thats a bit extreme. The reality is that more people are having problems right now. Theyre losing their doctor. Theyre losing the plan that they liked. Id like him to defend -- I mean, I read to you guys two days ago Nancy Pelosis own definition of success for Obamacare. They had three prongs for that, and they failed on all three of them.So Governor Beshear -- you know, the President last night extended an olive branch to Democrats and Republicans to work with him on a plan that actually achieves the goals that were laid out. Thats what he should -- if he wants to be focused, its not just former governors, but I think current governors were here to talk about what they want. And so I know Governor Bevin, the current governor of Kentucky, has noted the concerns that Obamacare has in Kentucky now. And I think those are the challenges and problems that the President is seeking to fix on this.The reality is, is that we have to have a healthcare system that Americans can afford, that give them choice, that have doctors that can deal with the problems they have. And that's what we're working with Congress on right now is to get that kind of a plan in place.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. One brief question.MR. SPICER: Wow. (Laughter.)Q  Senator Schumer, the Minority Leader, has said that the President is stalling on one of the pivotal points of his agenda -- infrastructure -- where he could work with Democrats. What's the administration's response to Senator Schumer?MR. SPICER: Well, I think first and foremost, I'm glad to see that he has finally found one area that he's willing to work with the President on. I know that multiple times this morning he was offered an opportunity on various shows to talk about things that he thought they could work with on the -- with the President. And I think it took -- in particular, I saw the exchange on NBC and it was somewhat disappointing that when you look at all the things that the President said that I think offered an olive branch to both parties and seemingly should unify the country on issues and on goals, that it's nice to finally hear that we found one. Because I think there were a lot of areas in that speech last night that transcended party lines and ideology, and that united us all as Americans.With respect to infrastructure, I think the President noted last night that we're going to continue to see a plan evolve that's really structured in a private partner financing mechanism that will continue to move forward. But whether it's our roads or bridges, our airports, air traffic control, there is an infrastructure piece of our nation that is so vital to the way we do life. And not just that, but -- not just the building itself and the construction of it, but those roads are what -- are the byway and the pathway to so much of our economic commerce today. And doing them not only is good for the jobs that they will create on the projects, but allowing us to have -- allowing products to get to market and consumers to get to business, et cetera, is actually a magnifying event for that.Q  Sean, I'm just looking for some clarification on your comments from the last week about the administration's stance on recreational marijuana. During the campaign, the President had said that this is a states' rights issue. Is this still where he believes this issue should flow, or does he believe it's a federal --MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think, Trey, there is a specific carve-out in the appropriations for medical marijuana. And I think the President understands that that can be a vital part of treatment, especially for terminally ill patients and people facing certain kinds of medical things. But there is a -- I think I was very -- I'm sorry if I wasn't, but I think I was clear that there is a big difference between the medical and the non-medical.Margaret.Q  Sean, two things on the speech. The President talked about robust engagement when he was talking about foreign policy. But at the same time, the White House is talking about cutting foreign aid by a large amount. How do you track those two things?MR. SPICER: Well, because you can have engagement -- I mean, I don't know that --Q  Like, who is going to be doing the diplomacy if you're cutting the State Department funding?MR. SPICER: I mean, who is going to be doing it? There's people that do -- Q  Who is the lead on foreign policy? Is it the White House or the State Department?  MR. SPICER: Secretary of State.Q  It is the Secretary of State?MR. SPICER: Of course, it is. I mean, look, the President obviously guides our foreign policy in terms of who implements it, whether it's -- if you talk about healthcare, it's going to be the Secretary of Health and Human Services. If it's on trade, it's going to be the USTR. I mean, so it's pretty clear that the Secretary of State implements the President's foreign policy agenda.Q  Right, but more robust versus cutting. They sound contradictory --MR. SPICER: But, again, I think this is a very Washington trap. Just because dollars do not decide engagement -- I think one of the things that's fascinating is that as the President has talked to all of these foreign leaders -- I don't know in a single case -- and, again, I can't say I've been on every call -- but I can't think of -- maybe one or two or something, because again, I don't want to get in a trap of trying to -- but I cannot say in most cases, at least, that I've heard direct aid being a discussion that has come up.In fact, what I hear more often is: ""Gosh, we havent heard from the United States in a long time. We havent had you engage in issues of concern with us. We havent talked about trade. We havent talked about other issues of bilateral concern."" I think that's what a robust, healthy, bilateral relationship with a country is about.I think it is a very Washington-centered argument to literally tie dollars to any program or any type of engagement -- to say something is robust by the dollar figure is something that is a very Washington answer. But I think that you can look at dollars that have gotten to a lot of countries. And when we ask them, what's your relationship been with the United States? Theyll say, we havent had much engagement at all with the United States in a while.Anita.Q  Sorry, I had a second question --MR. SPICER: John tried to start something; it just didn't continue. (Laughter.)Q  In the speech last night, while the President talked about support for vets and support for military, he didn't talk about the 9,000 troops in Afghanistan, the 5,000 in Iraq, the hundreds of operators on the ground in Syria. Was there a reason that he didn't lay out his vision for foreign policy in those active war zones?MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think you could probably go through and say, he also didn't talk about this or that. He talked about his --Q  The world is watching, and those are clear --MR. SPICER: I understand that. But you can go through a lot of hotspots that we have in a country. I think when it comes to the military itself, he was very clear about his commitment to the military, his desire to fund the military, give them the infrastructure that it needs. Its why hes going to go to Hampton Roads tomorrow to talk about the investment that needs to get made. He talked about veterans and caring for the folks. So I understand your question. But I think at some point you can literally go through all of the other areas that may not have come up on domestic and foreign policy, other nations that didn't get a mention, or a hotspot that didn't get up.But I think in terms of his commitment to the country, his commitment to defeating ISIS, he did bring that up. He talked about the plan that he wants to have, the engagement that hes having with the Joint Chiefs in the military, the funding that he wants to lend them. So I get that you can parse out something and say, ""but he didn't bring up this exact thing."" Theres a lot of things that may or may not have come up last night, and that doesn't necessarily mean he didn't have the commitment to it.Q  He wasnt deemphasizing foreign policy?MR. SPICER: No, I think he talked about ISIS. He talked about the military. He talked about it. So I don't have --Anita.Q  It will not surprise you that I have two questions. The first one is quick. MR. SPICER: I think for Lent everyone needs to give up two questions. (Laughter.) Or maybe I could at least give up answering two questions. (Laughter.)Q  Ill make the first one quick, so how about that? Can you update us on where we are on the executive order regarding vetting?MR. SPICER: Yeah, as I said, we would have an announcement at some point scheduling-wise. When we have one, well announce it. I think the President, as I mentioned a couple days ago, the issue for us has been a continued desire to share with the departments and agencies the ability to implement this, and we continue to do that. When we have a schedule to announce --Q  When do you think --MR. SPICER: Ive not -- Ive learned not to put days on things, because until we announce it, its much like we've talked about all the executive orders, with all the personnel announcements. When the President is ready to make a decision, he lets us know and we let you know. So we're not there yet.Q  The second question -- can you tell us a little bit about the back story with Carryn Owens being there yesterday? She wasnt on the list you all sent out. When did the President talk to her? When did that happen? When was she invited? Why wasnt she on the official list? And did they have a chance to visit beforehand?MR. SPICER: Okay, I'll take these in order. She was invited on January 30th. In the condolence call to her, the President invited her and her three children to the White House. And during that call, said, ""You know, by the way, I'm going to be giving this speech in February. If you would feel comfortable, I would love to have you as a guest."" He asked if she'd like to bring the kids at that time. It was obviously a very raw and emotional time for her, and she said that's -- she appreciated the invitation, she would love to take him up on it, would get back to us. The President asked the military aide in the room at the time to follow up with her. She accepted the invitation. So she and her three children came to the White House yesterday, met with the President prior to the speech, and they had a time to visit before and then after, obviously. Why she wasnt on the guidance: We had a conversation with her prior, and just said, you know, I know this is an emotional time for you. Respectfully to you guys, we knew that if we had released her name, that there would be a lot of media attention to her and her family. And we spoke to her before we put out the guest guidance and just said, would you rather us wait and hold? So we made a decision at the time that this was a very raw and emotional time for her, and we didnt -- we worked with her to decide what would be in her best interest and her family's best interest at this time. Q  Were the children there?MR. SPICER: No, they were not there.Q  But her parents were there, correct?MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  But the children were in town --MR. SPICER: The children were in town. They visited the White House. They had an opportunity to visit the Navy Mess, have lunch, go up and see -- and so the President got to see them. And they got a tour of the White House.Q  Was there some special interaction with Ivanka, because she was sitting next to her? Or it just happened to be where she sat?MR. SPICER: They met obviously over -- and obviously after -- at the end of the evening, the President brought them into the room where he was holding, and everybody, including the First Lady, had a chance to talk to her and her family, and mother and father. But, as I said, this was something that was extended -- the invitation was extended to her on the 30th of January when the President made that first call to her. And again, just respectfully in terms of the follow-up, I know there's been a lot of interest in her, in Carryn. And we have -- our goal was to make sure that we respected her wishes and her privacy. And again, even with referencing her in the speech, that was her decision. We asked her -- the President would like to raise this. And she said, I'd like that. And so that was coordinated with her in terms of how public she wanted to be and how acknowledged she wanted her and Ryan to be as well. Q  I just thought I'd bring this up so you could respond to it. You must have seen the criticism of her being there and the President mentioning her. And people are saying it's a photo-op. So since you're talking about it, do you want to respond to that, that it's a way to --MR. SPICER: I think that that's -- I mean, again, he invited her on January 30th and extended an invitation. I dont -- it was she who accepted the invitation. I think she has a right to honor the legacy and sacrifice of her husband. And I think -- I've been in this town 25 years, probably watched State of the Unions for 30 -- which doesnt say a lot -- (laughter) -- for my viewing habits -- but I've never seen a sustained applause like that. And I think that you can say what you want about a lot of the policies, but I hope to God that everybody in America could literally say that that's the country that we live in, that you honor and support, not just Ryan's sacrifice, but her -- what she's going to go through and what those children are going to go through.It was amazing -- I got a chance to talk to the kids yesterday and see them so -- you know, they're kids, they were happy, they were running around. I dont know that they fully appreciate the sacrifice that their father has made. But I just -- I'm not going to -- if that's the criticism that people that, they have a right to in this country. But I would also suggest that we have the right to honor the people who have served this nation and the sacrifice that the families make of those who serve.Q  Thanks, Sean. There were some quotes floating around last night from anonymous administration officials saying --MR. SPICER: What? (Laughter.) Q  What a surprise, right? (Laughter.) That part of the reason for the postponement of the announcement of the new travel ban was the positive reception of the speech, and that the administration wants the new executive order to ""have its own moment."" Was the speech perception part of the reason --MR. SPICER: I will just refer you back to what I said to Anita's first question. We hadnt made an announcement. And I think that -- again, this gets back to personnel announcements, executive order announcements, other things. Until they're on the schedule, that doesnt make them official. And that's the point of making the announcement, is that we say this is where we're going and this is what we're doing. We try to provide you guys guidance. Obviously, there's a reason that we dont -- because sometimes things arent ready, sometimes we want to make -- the President hasnt made up his final mind about executing something, or he wants to add something in. It's the same thing with the speech yesterday. I mean, we worked up until game time because the President wanted to continue to work on it.But when we have announcements to make, we'll make them. Until we do, then it's not final. Mara.Q  Thank you. I have two really short questions. The first one on the travel ban. The first request was for 90 days so that you could develop the new vetting regime. Thirty days have passed. I assume that means you're 30 days into this process. Does that mean that the next travel ban will ask for just the remaining time of the 90 days?MR. SPICER: Respectfully, I'm not -- this goes back to the last couple. I'm not going to start getting into discussions of an executive order that hasnt been announced yet. So to start talking about the specifics of something that I'm not even going to talk about the schedule of -- I'll give you credit for the try.Q  Okay, that's fair. My next question is on taxes. He talked about massive tax cuts for the middle class. Your Treasury Secretary at one point said there would be no absolute cut for the wealthy. What does that mean?MR. SPICER: It means that I think the focus is on the middle class. I think there's two things that are going to be highlighted in the tax reform. One is to make our companies and corporations and businesses more competitive so that they stay in this country and hire more people. I mean, that's --Q  Right, I'm talking individuals.MR. SPICER: I know, I know. But what I'm saying is that there's two big components are going to drive tax reform -- that being one to help companies hire more people. And then two is the focus on the individual side of the ledger is going to be on middle-income tax relief. And so I think that's what Secretary Mnuchin was referring to.Q  But are you saying that a wealthy person will not get a larger -- in terms of percentage -- tax cut than a middle-class person? I mean, is that how you're measuring it?MR. SPICER: Again, all I'm going to do is stick at the high level now and say that the principle that's guiding this is middle-class tax relief. So I'm not going to get into deciding all this yet.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. A lot has been made about the President's tone, his demeanor last night in his address to Congress in the sense that some people are describing it as very presidential; we haven't seen this side of President Trump in the early days of his presidency. Was this a one-off? Is this something we can expect from the President more often? For instance, tomorrow he is traveling down to the Newport News, Virginia area. Will we see the President Trump that we saw last night in his address to Congress, or more like the campaign-style rally that we saw down in Florida, which took place a few weeks ago?MR. SPICER: I think the Vice President said it best this morning. I mean, this is the President Trump, the candidate Trump, the President-elect Trump that I've known. And I think sometimes -- so I respectfully disagree in the sense that I think that the folks around him who have known him, who have gotten to know him, this is something that you see on a regular basis. And I think we're going to continue to see this. I think more and more -- one of the programs this morning noted that people who have been around him for a long time, this is who he is. I think he's talked about this a lot, and I know sometimes you pull random clips, but this is who he is. And I don't necessarily subscribe to are we going to see more or less of this. He cares about this country, he's got a big heart, he wants America to succeed, he wants America to be safe, he wants more Americans to get back to work. And I think you're going to hear him talk about that over and over again.Blake.Q  Sean, the trade document that's out there, which suggests that the administration may take a position that would potentially ignore or look past WTO rulings. Is there any truth to this? MR. SPICER: No.Q  What is the position?MR. SPICER: Again, I would just argue, look, we're a member of the WTO, we don't have a USTR in place yet. So to suggest that we're going to take any kind of trade policies -- I think, obviously, we've got some concerns with the percentage of dispute resolutions that are brought to the WTO versus other nations. But I would just -- that's sort of a fact in terms of the percentage of cases that get brought to dispute resolution at the USTR -- or, excuse me, at the WTO against the United States. But we don't have a U.S. Trade Representative, so I would say that that's not --Q  Like a working --MR. SPICER: No, no, no. I mean, it's not even a working. That's not -- full stop -- that is not our policy and that's not where we're going.Yes.Q  Sean, this is a follow-up on the -- from the heart. Was the President's softening of his immigration stand one from the heart or one from the political handbook? Let's put it that way. And did you get ashes this morning?MR. SPICER: Well, as soon as -- I mean, not that Im a big fan of sharing, but I will be going to get my ashes later in a little bit. So --Q  (Inaudible.)MR. SPICER: I appreciate that. I will (inaudible) in mass, and Ill let my mom know that you appreciate that, and my parish priest. (Laughter.)Q  -- might be able to see you --MR. SPICER: I try to keep a little bit of the church and state out of this.Q  Do you have a confession?MR. SPICER: Huh?Q  Do you a have a confession while you're up there? (Laughter.)MR. SPICER: Theres three parts to Lent: alms giving, penance, and prayer. And I will make sure that I spend all 40 --Q  Can you answer the first part of the question?MR. SPICER: No, Im good with -- Im sorry I got lost in my faith. (Laughter.)Q  The Presidents softening --MR. SPICER: Yeah, thank you. Look, I dont know that I would agree. Look, the Presidents comments yesterday that were that, if we can get a bill, he would like to get that done. I think he -- in the conversation that he was having with network anchors, he talked about the fact -- and, frankly, one of the anchors said, if anyone can get a deal, it would be you. Obviously, he was pleased with that because its true. And I think he recognizes that a solution, a comprehensive solution has eluded our nation for a long time, and its a big problem. And if he can get it, consistent with his principles, he will. And I think he made that clear, and the full context of those comments are just that, and in the speech he commented on as well.And I think theres a difference between sacrificing your principles to get a deal, and working with others, consistent with your principles to get a deal. And I think his principles remain consistent, and he understands that the benefit of actually enacting a comprehensive solution to a big problem that we face in the country, I think thats kind of where his head is at.Zeke.Q  Thank you, Sean.MR. SPICER: Im sorry. Go ahead, Zeke.Q  Okay. Two for you. First, following up on Monday, the ISIS review -- the status of the review process -- who was involved and what is being (inaudible)? The President -- who else is being looped into the process?MR. SPICER: Im sorry, I owed you that, and I will get back to you. The principals committee did meet. General Mattis shared his outline and ideas and comments, and he got a lot of feedback from the principals committee. And remember, thats -- and Id need to get Michael to get back with you on that. I owe you that, and my apologies. Ill add it to my confession. (Laughter.)Q  And then the second is, just following the President's line of speech last night about the time for trivial fights is behind us -- does the President believe that he has also sometimes engaged in some of these trivial fights? And going forward, should we be expecting less of these fights from him with all sorts of people?MR. SPICER: Im going to let -- the Presidents vision and words last night should stand for themselves. I think he was very clear in terms of what he expects from the country. Jessica.Q  The President talked about merit-based immigration last night. Can you talk a little bit more about what that means, and whether that indicates a desire to change legal immigration from a focus on family reunification to some sort of making sure they have a job in the United States? And was he also trying to imply that we dont have a merit-based immigration system?MR. SPICER: Well, I think he was -- look, I would just refer you back to what he said. I mean, youve got countries like Canada and Australia, in particular, that have a true merit-based system, and I think he was making it clear that we currently dont necessarily -- the results of our immigration system dont yield, necessarily, one that reflects a merit-based one.But I will say that there was, I think, a very substantial case that he made in terms of merit-based -- what he wants and how he wants to get there.Jeremy.Q  Can I have a second? I was going to have a second question.MR. SPICER: Im sorry.Q  The President also had a comment about how many factories have left the United States since China joined the WTO. Last night his number was 60,000. A week ago, on February 23rd, he used the figure of 70,000. Just wondering what the genesis of the figure is, and what the White House believes to be the number of factories. And also whether it is truly attributable to China joining the WTO or other factors, as well.MR. SPICER: Im going to -- well get somebody to follow up with you on the cite for that, as well.I went to Jeremy.Q  Is the President considering the Pentagon and his Defense Secretary more authority to greenlight raids like the kind that we saw in Yemen? And is that, in part, driven by the political blowback that that raid had initially?And secondly, could you talk about -- the initial executive order on the travel ban called for a 30-day review period to see if they would -- you would add additional countries to the list of banned --MR. SPICER: Ill take the second one first. I can refer you back to Mara Liassons question. (Laughter.) On the first part, I think that he has been very clear from the get-go. He talked about some of the tactics used a while ago, and he said, Im going to rely on General Mattis and his expertise. And I think when it comes to national security, hes got an amazing team by all standards -- whether its Secretary Mattis, Secretary Kelly, General McMaster. Theres a whole host of these -- with General Kellogg. And I think hes always talked about hes going to rely on his advisors to give him advice.I think at the end of the day there are certain decisions that have to be signed off by the President. And I would respectfully dispute the characterization of that, and I think we've pushed back and discussed this several times. There is -- this raid and action and mission was one that I think we have detailed very, very closely -- or carefully -- about the timeline for this, and when it was signed off on, and by whom. And it was initiated, signed off on by the previous administration in writing, with a signature to greenlight it. And it was further reviewed and concurred under this administration that the same basis for greenlighting it back then stood. So, respectfully, the actual timeline and documentation does not support the accusation or the question that you're trying to ask.Q  And just as far as this was -- is nothing going to change as far as who greenlights certain raids?MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think legally -- Jeremy, I don't want to get into specifics because I think there is certain action that requires presidential sign-off. And theres certain action in terms of echelon -- the way the military works, you have different echelons that can be signed off on certain things. And I think there are certain things that have to be signed off by the President of the United States.Q  (Inaudible) protocol.MR. SPICER: So the protocol is not changing in terms of what has to be signed off, but I think that the President has made clear -- all that being said, he relies heavily on their input, their decision-making, their opinions, and their analysis and conclusions. That's different. And I think one of the issues that you saw -- or some of the criticism that you saw last administration was that you had a lot of the combatant commanders in particular who would say, we came to a conclusion, we made the case, and we weren't allowed to move forward.That's where I think the nuance that you're asking actually lies, which is --Q  Right, so is he making a change to address that criticism?MR. SPICER: No, no, no. I think his point -- it's a philosophy more than a sort of a change in policy, which is he believes that these are the experts in this field -- as he does with all of his Cabinet. I mean, I think if you ask -- in terms of foreign policy interaction, he would say, okay, I chose Secretary Tillerson because I believe he's the right guy for this job; if Betsy DeVos has an educational matter that's going to come up. He chose these highly qualified individuals because he believes in their expertise and understanding of the issues.I think his point and his philosophy is, generally, if they come to him with a case and lay it out, then he is -- that is going to weigh heavily on his decision-making, whereas I think in the last administration, one of the major critiques was that they would come to them and then there was a preponderance -- the preponderance of time. It would be, no, we're not going to move forward with this. So I just want to be --Phil.Q  Sean, a lot of lawmakers were heartened by the speech last night and drew a contrast from the inaugural address 40 days prior, and said that the tone was very different, the substance was different, the olive branches and outreach. Does the White House agree with that characterization? Was it on purpose? And if it was on purpose, what, over the course of those 40 days, inspired the course correction?MR. SPICER: It was not on purpose. There is no -- I mean, one was an inaugural. One was a joint address. They're two different speeches, and I think that they serve two different purposes in terms of what you're trying to lay out. I think the joint address serves as sort of a place hold for the State of the Union for first term -- or first year, first term.Q  The way he communicated.MR. SPICER: I understand -- you're right. And I think he wanted to lay out -- it's a much different and longer speech. He had different sort of messaging objectives at each. But I also dispute the notion on the inaugural. Like, I mean, I think that when you actually look at the critique, people will look at four or five different lines. But for the most part, for much -- the most part -- the high majority of that speech, he talked about the American people, the American worker, and the challenges that they face and where he thinks the country has kind of gotten off-track prioritizing them and his desire to put, what he called, the forgotten people back number one in line. And then so one was sort of -- that was laying out his sort of vision for the presidency. This time I think it was much more of a laying out the policies of how he's going to achieve that. And that's the purpose of a joint address. So I just -- it's two different speeches, but I just don't agree with the characterization of the inaugural in the first place.Q  Was there some conclusion, though, in the White House or by the President himself that that rhetorical approach early on in the presidency, that the tweets, that the speeches -- like he did at CPAC the other day, the fighting with the media -- that that was not helping and he needed to do something different?MR. SPICER: No. No, no, there wasn't. I just -- again, I think he -- and this particular speech was a very personal -- again, like, each speech, each speech has a different audience, a different objective. And I think for this speech, he was very personal, he was very, very much him. It was his work, it was his voice, it was his words, it was his edits, it was his suggestions. And then he had a team surrounded by him, including the Vice President, the chief of staff, Steve Miller, Steve Bannon, Jared, Ivanka was part of it. There was a -- Kellyanne, Hope -- who he would bounce ideas and objectives off of. But this was a Trump speech from his heart, as he said, that evolved over the course of the last 10 days or so. And in the last 48 to 72 hours, really accelerated, got very crisp. And it was up until about 12:15 -- excuse me, that's when I got home. (Laughter.) About 6:15 yesterday when we really started to get that real final point on it, because it was something that was very, very personal to him. But I wouldn't conflate the two and try to compare one speech with another. He looked at them as very different objectives in terms of how the speech.I need to run.Q  But, Sean, was this a reset? Was it a reset speech?MR. SPICER: No, it wasn't a reset speech. I need to get on. I've got some things I have to take care of. But thank you. We will, as I mentioned, expect a gaggle on the way down to Hampton Roads tomorrow, and we will see you later.Thank you all.END12:25 P.M.

Trump welcomed Republican Congressional leaders to the Roosevelt Room today to continue their close working relationship.The Congressional leaders praised the President for delivering a powerful address in the House Chamber last night, and said the momentum it has created could be a catalyst for producing extraordinary change for the American people.The President expressed his appreciation for the special group of leaders before hosting a discussion about working closely together to advance a legislative agenda that puts the interests of the American people first.Topics of discussion included the budget and tax reform, and the final portion of the meeting revolved around the groups plan to improve the Nations healthcare system by repealing Obamacare and replacing it with a patient-focused system that expands access, brings down costs, and improves healthcare outcomes.The group agreed on a path forward where White House and Congressional leaders work in cooperation to deliver the reforms the American people need.",21115.55,303.3099999999977,5904.03,78.59000000000015,2395.96,32.320000000000164
248,2017-03-01,President Donald J. Trump Proclaims March 2017 as American Red Cross Month,"AMERICAN RED CROSS MONTH, 2017- - - - - - -BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATIONFor more than 135years, the American Red Cross has stepped into the breach, providing shelter, food, and emotional support to victims of natural disaster, war, conflict, and unexpected hardship. Today, the Red Cross is responsible for a remarkable 40percent of our Nation's blood supply, teaches life-saving techniques to volunteer citizen-rescuers, and leads the world in international humanitarian aid. The Red Cross has proudly and ardently supported our military, our veterans, and their families for more than a century, delivering over 352,000 services to members of the military and veterans each year.The American Red Cross is a miracle-working organization, rooted in the legacy of its gallant founder, Clara Barton, who tore down every convention at the time regarding women in battle, giving history one of the most incredible examples of courage and devotion to duty that it has ever known. Her tremendous legacy lives on through the Red Cross's assistance to hundreds of thousands of Americans affected by disasters each year. In 2016, volunteers responded to 180 significant incidents, including wildfires, storms, flooding, Hurricane Matthew, and other emergencies at all times of the day and night. They opened nearly 800 emergency shelters, served more than 4.1million meals and snacks, and distributed more than 2.1million relief items. Last year, the Red Cross helped 79,000 families recover from home fires that left them with no place to go.The comfort, care, and relief provided by the American Red Cross serves a great mission. When those in need see that recognizable symbol of hope, the Red Cross, they see the hearts of the American people at work an incredibly powerful thing. When they see that beacon, they know that true help is on the way, and they feel our people's mighty generosity, love, and support for their fellow human beings.To perform its vital national and international roles, the Red Cross relies on volunteers and the support of the American people. The RedCross needs our continued commitment of time, resources, and funds to be successful, and our country and the world need the Red Cross.NOW, THEREFORE, I, Donald J. Trump, President of the UnitedStates of America and Honorary Chairman of the American Red Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the UnitedStates, do hereby proclaim March2017 as American Red Cross Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and by supporting the work of service and relief organizations.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this firstday of March, in the year of our Lord twothousandseventeen, and of the Independence of the UnitedStates ofAmerica the twohundred and forty-first.DONALD J.

Trump Proclaims March 2017 as Women's History Month,"WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH, 2017- - - - - - -BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATIONWe are proud of our Nation's achievements in promoting women's full participation in all aspects of American life and are resolute in our commitment to supporting women's continued advancement in America and around the world.America honors the celebrated women pioneers and leaders in our history, as well as those unsung women heroes of our daily lives. We honor those outstanding women, whose contributions toour Nation's life, culture, history, economy, and families have shaped us and helped us fulfill America's promise.We cherish the incredible accomplishments of early American women, who helped found our Nation and explore the great western frontier. Women have been steadfast throughout our battles to end slavery, as well as our battles abroad. And American women fought for the civil rights of women and others in the suffrage and civil rights movements. Millions of bold, fearless women have succeeded as entrepreneurs and in the workplace, all the while remaining the backbone of our families, our communities, and our country.During Women's History Month, we pause to pay tribute to the remarkable women who prevailed over enormous barriers, paving the way for women of today to not only participate in butto lead and shape every facet of American life. Since our beginning, we have been blessed with courageous women like Henrietta Johnson, the first woman known to work as an artist inthe colonies; Margaret Corbin, who bravely fought in the American Revolution; and Abigail Adams, First Lady of the UnitedStates and trusted advisor to President John Adams.We also remember incredible women like Mary Walker, the first woman to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor; Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery in 1849 and went on to free hundreds of others through the Underground Railroad; Susan B. Anthony, the publisher and editor of The Revolution and her friend, Dr.Charlotte Lozier, one of the first women medical doctors inthe UnitedStates, both of whom advocated for the dignity andequality of women, pregnant mothers, and their children; RosaParks, whose refusal to give up her seat accelerated the modern civil rights movement; Shirley Temple Black, the famous actress turned diplomat and first chief of protocol for the President of the UnitedStates; Anna Bissell, the first woman CEO in American history; Amelia Earhart, the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean; Ella Fitzgerald, the First Lady of Song and the Queen of Jazz; and Sally Ride, the first American woman astronaut.America will continue to fight for women's rights and equality across the country and around the world. Though poverty holds back many women, America cannot and will not allow this to persist. We will empower all women to pursue their American dreams, to live, work and thrive in safe communities that allow them to protect and provide for themselves and their families.America is also mindful of the fight that continues for so many women around the world, where women are often not protected and treated disgracefully as second-class citizens. America will fight for these women too, and it will fight to protect young girls who are robbed of their rights, trafficked around the world, and exploited.NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the UnitedStates of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the UnitedStates, do hereby proclaim March2017 as Women's History Month.

Trump Proclaims March 2017 as Irish-American Heritage Month,"IRISH-AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH, 2017- - - - - - -BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATIONIrish Americans have made an indelible mark on the UnitedStates. From Dublin, California, to Limerick, Maine, from Emerald Isle, North Carolina, to Shamrock, Texas, we are reminded of the more than 35 million Americans of Irish descent who contribute every day to all facets of life in the UnitedStates. Over generations, millions of Irish have crossedthe ocean in search of the American Dream, and their contributions continue to enrich our country today.From our four Irish-born Founding Fathers to Thomas Francis Meagher, the Irish revolutionary who became an American hero after leading the Irish Brigade during the Civil War, Irish immigrants have shaped our history in enduring ways. Throughout the centuries, hard-working Irish Americans have contributed to America's innovation and prosperity -- tilling the farms of Appalachia, working the looms of New England textile mills, and building transcontinental railroads -- often overcoming poverty and discrimination and inspiring Americans from all walks of life with their indomitable and entrepreneurial spirit in the process. From these early beginnings rose generations of Irish Americans who continue to lead our cities, drive our economy, and protect and defend the land they embrace as their own.American culture carries an unmistakably Irish-American imprint. Our literature, cinema, music, dance, sports, and visual arts are filled with the names and influence of great Irish Americans.Irish Americans should be proud of the deep cultural, historical, and familial ties that have contributed to the strength of our vibrant transatlantic relationship with Ireland. As we honor the past during Irish-American Heritage Month, we also celebrate a bright future of friendship and cooperation for generations to come.NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the UnitedStates of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2017 as Irish-American Heritage Month.

252,2017-03-02,"Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer en route Joint Base Andrews, 3/2/2017","Aboard Air Force OneEn Route Joint Base Andrews3:44 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: I hope you guys had a great visit. I'm going to try to keep this short, obviously. We've got a short flight time home.This morning, the President was glad to see Ben Carson confirmed as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and former governor of Texas confirmed as the Secretary of Energy. He looks forward to working with them to enact his bold agenda. The Secretaries will be sworn in this evening -- Secretary Carson at 5:00 p.m. and then Secretary Perry at 5:30 p.m.The President was honored to visit our next aircraft carrier of the United States Navy, the Gerald R. Ford, today. As he emphasized on the campaign trail and again Tuesday in his address, expansion of the United States Armed Forces is a major priority for him, and the naval fleet is a significant portion of that. Expanding our current fleet of ships requires a collaborative partnership between the military and industry leaders to ensure maximum efficiency for taxpayers. The Navy is a vital part of the President's strategy to defeat terrorism with aircraft carriers, especially important in areas where we don't have a base, from which to launch missions, project power and protect American interest. Hand-in-hand with military leaders and the shipbuilding community, the Trump administration will continue to build extraordinary crafts like the Gerald R. Ford, protect taxpayer dollars, and support the jobs the shipbuilding industry provides, and, most importantly, keep our nation safe. While onboard today, the President received a briefing from military leaders. He then took a tour of the ship, after which he gave remarks on the hangar bay to several thousand workers and crew members and shipyard workers, which I think you all saw.The Vice President was in Ohio this afternoon with Secretary Price to discuss the President's economic agenda and especially repealing and replacing the Obamacare disaster. The Vice President then participated in a listening session with small business owners and a tour of Frame USA, an American-owned and operated small business, and delivered remarks at Frame USA.With that, you have a couple questions before we --Q  Did Sessions lie during his testimony in January, saying he didn't have any communication with the Russians?MR. SPICER: No, I think the senator's comments were clearly with respect to his -- he was asked about his role as a surrogate and whether he understood the campaign -- whether the campaign had contacts, and he said no. It was in his -- I think clearly with respect to his role as a campaign surrogate.Q  Has the President spoken with the Attorney General about any of this?MR. SPICER: No.Q  Was the President told that General Sessions should recuse himself from the Russian --MR. SPICER: I think that the President -- you guys got that question answered from him directly.Q  Should he provide more information to the committee, perhaps, to try to clarify his comments?MR. SPICER: I know the Attorney General is going to speak very shortly, so let's just -- I'll leave it at that. But I think the President made his views clear with you guys just a short time ago.Q  He doesn't have any concerns about whether he should have given a more clear response at the time?MR. SPICER: Well, obviously -- I mean, I'll let the Attorney General speak for himself. But I think that clearly if you listen to what he was responding to, he's clearly referring to his role as a campaign surrogate. That's what the question was about. And I think there's no --Q  So in that role as a campaign surrogate, does that mean, like, if he was asked at a campaign rally, he's a campaign surrogate? If he's at his office, he's a senator? Like, where does one role begin and the other one stop?MR. SPICER: We're moments away from him addressing this. And it was really silly for me to try to talk about what he may or may not think. But I think most people -- almost a clear -- I don't think there's very few other ways to read it when you look at the transcript and see the back and forth that he was clearly referring to himself. He was very -- he was clear in referring to himself as a campaign surrogate and believed that that's what the question was about. But I will let -- I mean, we're literally moments away from him addressing this, and I think the President made his view clear.Q  Sean, I had a big question of what he told the Senate. Is the White House annoyed that he wasn't completely forthcoming with you guys?MR. SPICER: Forthcoming about what? I mean, he's a United States --Q  (Inaudible) with the Russian ambassador.MR. SPICER: Wait, hold on, he's a United States senator who speaks to countless -- I mean, that's -- I mean, he was a campaign surrogate and gave the candidate at that time some ideas and advice in very important -- he had the value -- the President values his opinion tremendously, as you can tell by the fact that he wanted him in his Cabinet.But the fact of the matter is, how can you do something -- I mean, he was literally conducting himself as a United States senator.Q  Yes, of course.MR. SPICER: But hold on, and let's be clear, you look at all these other senators who have had contact, and this is what senators do in the course of conducting themselves in their job. And as you've seen, whether it's some of these folks that initially came out of the gate and said that they had never done it, the list gets larger and larger.Q  But why wouldn't he go ahead and talk -- there was already this flap about the ambassador and Flynn. Why wouldn't Sessions put it out there?MR. SPICER: Again, Im going to let him answer it, but I think that it was pretty clear. The question was about the campaign, and I think the -- literally, correct me if Im wrong, I dont have the question in front of me, but I think something to the effect of the campaign comments regarding the election of -- the 2016 election. So if you havent had anything then theres nothing -- I mean, again --Q  But (inaudible) saying he should recuse himself, and what about Nancy Pelosi and others saying he should resign?MR. SPICER: I would suggest to you that I think its interesting that a lot of these guys -- this continues to seem to be much more of a partisan thing that weve seen over and over again. As I think Ive mentioned from the -- this continues to be a question of theres no there there. And its the same over and over and over. Q  You think theres no there there.MR. SPICER: Its not that I dont think --Q  (Inaudible) a Republican.MR. SPICER: I know who he is. I know its -- but Im just suggesting that I think the point is that -- again, Im going to let the Attorney General speak for himself, but the bottom line is, is that for six months now weve heard the same thing over and over again, unnamed sources talking about nebulous, unnamed things, and keep having to say the same thing. At some point, you have to ask yourself where the there is.Q  Sean, were hearing rumblings that there may not be a new travel ban coming anymore. Can you confirm that? When do you expect it then?MR. SPICER: Again, Ive made this very clear to you guys. Ill say again what Ive said before. Im not -- and when the President has made a decision about something that hes ready for us to announce, well announce it, but were not there yet.But again, I think that the --Q  So youre taking your time a little bit more with it?MR. SPICER: I think that we continue to have a guiding principle doing whats right to keep the nation safe, and hes doing everything he can to consult with agencies and departments and key stakeholders.Q  And hes still committed to revising this travel ban that was blocked in court?MR. SPICER: Im going to tell you that theres nothing that has changed from what Ive said in the past.Q  General Sessions was talking about the Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting in the summer. He said at the time that there should be --MR. SPICER: What are you talking about?Q  When General Sessions talked about the Loretta Lynch-Bill Clinton meeting in the summer, he said a special prosecutor was warranted. Why isnt a special prosecutor necessary in this case?MR. SPICER: Again, I think that the question goes back to what -- he didnt -- he was in the course of his Senate duties, did what senators do. Theres no discussion -- theres nothing that would lead anyone to believe that he didnt do anything that was part of his job.Q  What was that meeting in regards to?MR. SPICER: I dont know. But, I mean, theres nothing -- it was in his Senate office. There were Senate aides, from what I understand, conducting Senate business. Q  I dont think anybody is -- nobody is really questioning that the senator has the right to meet with the Russian ambassador in the course of his business. My question before was rather whether after -- when hes become attorney general, he didnt take the President or someone in the White House aside and say, listen, I dont think -- there was nothing untoward here but this is pertinent information given the current political climate.MR. SPICER: What pertinent information? Q  That he met with the Russian ambassador and it wasnt disclosed to the Senate.MR. SPICER: But he probably met with countless other ambassadors. And I think -- again, he probably met with countless other associations and constituents and --Q  So thats not something you would have wanted to know?MR. SPICER: I dont -- I guess my question is, why would we want to know everything that he did in conducting himself on behalf of the people of Alabama?Q  Okay, so youre fine with it coming out in the papers and learning about it this way?MR. SPICER: Learning about -- but heres my question: Learning about what? The fact of the matter is, if were learning about the fact that he did his job as a United States senator, then thats great. I dont think there has been anything that Im aware of at this time that suggests anything other than he did his job as a United States senator as, frankly, many of these other senators have now said, well, I met with this ambassador, or another ambassador. I mean, thats what senators do.Q  What about the Counsels Office asking staff to preserve Russia-related documents, materials --MR. SPICER: That's a pro-forma, standard operating procedure that -- and I think, frankly, it shows how serious we take this subject.Q  The President hasnt spoken to Sessions either last night or today? Why not?MR. SPICER: Why not? I mean, I think -- Im not --Q  Even though theres no there there --MR. SPICER: I mean, again, I think --Q  Have you spoken to Sessions, Sean?MR. SPICER: Im not going to -- look, Im just going to say that the Attorney General is going to make a statement very shortly, and Ill let that stand for itself.Were going to go down. Thank you, guys. Q  Sean, do you have anything on al-Masri?MR. SPICER: On what?Q  Al-Masri's death?MR. SPICER: No, I -- when we land I can maybe get something. Thanks, guys. END3:54 P.M.

253,2017-03-02,Remarks by President Trump Aboard the USS Gerald R. Ford,"Newport News, Virginia2:28 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much. What an honor. They just gave me this beautiful jacket. They said, here, Mr. President, please take this home. I said, let me wear it. (Laughter.) And then they gave me the beautiful hat, and I said, you know, maybe I'll do that. We have a great ""Make America Great Again"" hat, but I said, this is a special day, we're wearing this. Right? (Applause.) I have no idea how it looks, but I think it looks good. It's a great-looking hat -- just like this is a great-looking ship.Thank you. I'm privileged to stand here today with the incredible men and women of the United States Navy. (Applause.) American sailors are the best warfighting sailors anywhere in the world. And it's not even close. And, Susan, I am so glad you could be with us. I know how hard you work -- 17 visits. And she wanted things done right, I will tell you. They told me she wanted this one done right, in honor of both of her parents, who were great, great people. And we wanted to introduce this beautiful vessel to the American people. And I wanted to be here, I wanted to be with you. So, Susan, and to your family -- unbelievable job. Unbelievable. (Applause.) The soon-to-be commissioned Gerald R. Ford USS -- what a place. It really feels like a place. You stand on that deck, and you feel like you're standing on a very big piece of land. But this is better than land. It will not only be a great symbol of American strength, but a great legacy for your father, and our former President, Gerald Ford.President Ford was a Navy man. By the way, he was also a great athlete, for those of you that didnt know. He saw action in the South Pacific during World War II. He served this country with honor -- in the military, in Congress, and in the White House. The proud dignity of this ship is a fitting tribute to Gerald Ford, the man and the President. Congratulations to all of the men and women who helped build it. This is American craftsmanship at its biggest, at its best, at its finest. American workers are the greatest anywhere in the world. This warship, and all who serve on it, should be a source of shared pride for our nation. We are joined today -- (applause) -- better believe it, right? Better believe it. (Applause.) Better believe it. And, by the way, we're going to soon have more coming. We'll have more coming. (Applause.)  We are joined today by General Mattis, now Secretary Mattis -- (applause) -- where is he? -- who will be charged with overseeing this great rebuilding of our military might. We will give the men and women of Americas armed services the resources you need to keep us safe. We will have the finest equipment in the world -- planes, ships and everything else. We are going to have, very soon, the finest equipment in the world. (Applause.)We will give our military the tools you need to prevent war and, if required, to fight war and only do one thing -- you know what that is? Win! Win! (Applause.) We're going to start winning again.Admiral John Richardson, Chief of Naval Operations, is with us today as well -- great gentleman. Admiral, we're going to ensure our Navy has the resources, personnel training and equipment -- the kind of equipment that you need. So, congratulations, Admiral. And a lot more is coming. (Applause.)Let me congratulate Captain Richard McCormack, Commanding Officer of the Gerald R. Ford. This ship will make an extraordinary addition to the fleet like no other -- like no other. Anywhere in the world there's nothing like this. It represents the future of naval aviation. I have no greater privilege than to serve as your Commander-in-Chief and the Commander-in-Chief of the men and women of the United States military. Great people. (Applause.) Great, great people. I salute you, and I salute our sailors. I will always support you and your mission. I will never, ever let you down. And I also have to recognize Mike Petters, President and CEO of Huntington Ingalls Industries along with Matt Mulherin, President of Newport News Shipbuilding. (Applause.) They won't let you down either. (Applause.) They're not going to let you down either. (Applause.)To those who serve our nation in uniform and to those who build the instruments of our defense, I thank you on behalf of our nation. AUDIENCE MEMBER: U-S-A!THE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) I agree, I agree. (Laughter.) Our carriers are the centerpiece of American military might overseas. We are standing today on 4.5 acres of combat power and sovereign U.S. territory, the likes of which there is nothing to compete. There is no competition to this ship. It is a monument to American might that will provide the strength necessary to ensure peace. This ship will carry 4,500 personnel and 70 aircraft, and will be a vital component of our defense. This carrier and the new ships in the Ford class will expand the ability of our nation to carry out vital missions on the oceans to project American power in distant lands. Hopefully, it's power we dont have to use, but if we do, they're in big, big trouble. (Applause.)This great aircraft carrier provides essential capabilities to keep us safe from terrorism and take the fight to the enemy for many years in the future. The great Admiral Nimitz, who commanded the U.S. Pacific fleet through the Second World War, once said, ""It is the function of the Navy to carry the war to the enemy so that we'll not be fought on U.S. soil."" True. (Applause.) And it was under Admiral Nimitz's command 75 years ago this June that the Navy did just that at the Battle of Midway. You've all known about the Battle of Midway, where the sailors of the U.S. Navy fought with the bravery that will be remembered throughout the ages. Storied bravery throughout the ages. The backbone of the American fleet at Midway was three beautiful aircraft carriers: the Yorktown, the Enterprise and the Hornet. All three were built with American hands right here at the Newport News Shipyard. (Applause.) At Midway, America was greatly outnumbered by, I mean, a lot -- (laughter) -- and its fleet badly damaged. But the heroic deeds changed the course of history. Many brave Americans died that day, and, through their sacrifice, they turned the tide of the Pacific War. It was a tough tide, it was a big tide, it was a vicious tide, and they turned it.Countless other Americans in that war, some of them parents and grandparents to people in this room today, came home thanks to their very heroic deeds. The sailors at Midway are part of a long line of American heroes, an unbroken chain of patriots from each generation to the next, who rose to defend our flag and our freedom. That legacy continues today as American warriors protect our people from the threat of terrorism. On Tuesday, in my address to a joint session of Congress, I asked Congress to eliminate the defense sequester and to support my request for a great rebuilding of the United States military and the United States Navy. (Applause.) After years of endless budget cuts that have impaired our defenses, I am calling for one of the largest defense-spending increases in history. And by eliminating the sequester and the uncertainty it creates, we will make it easier for the Navy to plan for the future and thus to control costs and get the best deals for the taxpayer, which, of course, is very important, right? Got to get a good deal. If we dont make a good deal, were not doing our job.The same boat for less money. The same ship for less money. The same airplanes for less money. Thats what were doing. Thats what were doing. Means were going to get more of them, and we can use them. Our military requires sustained, stable funding to meet the growing needs placed on our defense. Right now, our aging frontline strike and strike-fighters -- the whole aircraft; many, many aircraft -- are often more likely to be downed for maintenance than they are to be up in the sky. Our Navy is now the smallest its been since, believe it or not, World War I. Dont worry, it's going to soon be the largest its been. Dont worry. (Applause.) Think of that. Think of that.In these troubled times, our Navy is the smallest its been since World War I. Thats a long time ago. In fact, I just spoke with Navy and industry leaders and have discussed my plans to undertake a major expansion of our entire Navy fleet, including having the 12-carrier Navy we need. (Applause.) We also need more aircraft, modernized capabilities, and greater force levels. Additionally, we must vastly improve our cyber capabilities. This great rebuilding effort will create many jobs in Virginia, and all across America, and it will also spur new technology and new innovation.America has always been the country that boldly leads the world into the future, and my budget will ensure we do so and continue to do exactly that. American ships will sail the seas. American planes will soar the skies. American workers will build our fleets. (Applause.) And Americas military will ensure that even though the darkest nights and throughout, a bright and glowing sun will always shine on our nation and on our people. Our Navy is great. Our Navy is great. Our people are great. Great. (Applause.) Our Republic will meet any challenge, defeat any danger, face any threat, and always seek true and lasting peace. May God bless our military. May God bless our Navy. May God bless the wonderful Gerald Ford family. And may God continue to bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. (Applause.)END2:42 P.M.

Trump took office and our country is already moving in the right direction.Yesterday, the President visited our Nation's newest aircraft carrier, the soon-to-be commissioned U.S.S.Gerald R. Ford. Our carriers are the centerpiece of American military might, projecting power and our unparalleled strength at sea. This beautiful new warship represents the future of naval aviation, and she will serve as a cornerstone of our national defense for decades to come. A famous aviator once wrote that to build a truly great ship, we shouldn't begin by gathering wood, cutting boards, or distributing work, but instead by awakening within the people a desire for the vast and endless sea. In the same way, we must continue to renew the American spirit in order to rebuild our country.On Tuesday, before a Joint Session of Congress, President Trump laid out a vision for how to accomplish that national rebuilding. His vision includes the elimination of the defense sequester, which has imposed steep cuts to our military.Investing in the military means investing in peacebecause the best way to prevent war, as George Washington said, is to be prepared for it. Most importantly, an investment in the military is an investment in the incredible men and women who serve our country in uniform. They are the best of us. They are the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever knownand we will support them every single step of the way.These are truly exciting times.

259,2017-03-03,ICYMI: Alan Tonelson in the New York Times: ‘What Trump Gets Right On Trade’,"What Trump Gets Right On TradeNew York TimesBy Alan TonelsonWhatever confusion people might have about President Trumps agenda, his position on trade and manufacturing is crystal clear. I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade, he said in his address to Congress Tuesday night. He called for corporate tax reform and export incentives, and he lashed out at Nafta and China for draining Americas manufacturing base.Although cheap, labor-intensive goods often come to mind when Americans think of job-displacing imports, the more capital- and technology-intensive segments of manufacturing have hardly been immune. Sectors like motor vehicles and parts, pharmaceuticals, telecommunications equipment, nonelectrical machinery (like machine tools, farm machinery and power-generating turbines) and industrial chemicals add up to nearly half of manufacturings enormous, chronic annual trade deficits nowadays.Since then, moreover, trade deficits in advanced manufacturing have worsened, and the stagnation of productivity growth suggests that the robots have been replacing fewer workers. So trade-related job loss in these sectors surely has grown  and smart, pro-domestic manufacturing policies can bring them back.The United States is not only the worlds biggest single national economy, but for all its recent sluggishness, it has also generally been the fastest-growing major economy, and it is the most open to imports. Thats why its the single largest export market for a fifth of the worlds countries. Thats why it has remained the worlds largest consumer of foreign goods, despite slashing its previously huge purchases of foreign oil. Thats largely why each percentage point of new American growth lifts global growth by much more than similar expansion in China, and nearly as much as growth in the euro area  which unlike the United States is relatively poor in natural resources and needs to buy many more commodities from overseas. Thats also why nearly all leading countries and groupings  including the eurozone  have long-run trade surpluses with the United States.The United States plays an even more central role in countries that have come into Mr. Trumps trade crosshairs. Slow-growing Mexico, for example, would be performing much more sluggishly if it were not able to export the equivalent of 28 percent of its annual economic output to the United States. Its auto shipments to America alone are its biggest generator of foreign exchange reserves.But the official manufacturing job and trade statistics make entirely obvious that the rewards to the American economy will be substantial.

261,2017-03-03,"Press Gaggle by Principal Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders En Route Orlando, Florida","Aboard Air Force OneEn Route Orlando, Florida 12:44 P.M. ESTMS. SANDERS: All right, I'll walk through -- I'll keep the opening quick since I know we're on tight time, but the President is going to spend his day here in Orlando, Florida, speaking with students, parents, teachers and administrators on how we can improve our education system and the importance of school choice. We'll be at the St. Andrew Catholic School. The President will then proceed to Palm Beach for a working weekend and returning on Sunday night to the White House.The Vice President will be Wisconsin today for a listening session with Wisconsin business leaders and their employees, and attending with him are Secretary Price and Speaker Ryan. Also attending with the President today in Florida Secretary DeVos, Florida Governor Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio, who is also on the plane with us today -- as well as Secretary DeVos.And with that, I will take your questions.Q  Is there any reaction from the White House to arrests in connection with the threats against Jewish community centers?MS. SANDERS: Is there any what? I'm sorry.Q  Reaction from the White House to the arrests.MS. SANDERS: I know that happened just within the last few hours and so I will get back to you on that if there's anything specific from us. But right now, it's still too early for us to say much about it. Let the process work.Q  Can you see why the White House decided that it's okay for the Keystone XL pipeline not to be built with American steel?MS. SANDERS: Well, the way that the executive order is written is actually -- and I'll get you the exact language, but you can probably all have it in your inboxes if you want to look back. But it's specific to new pipelines or those that are being repaired. And since this one is already currently under construction, the steel is already literally sitting there, it would be hard to go back. But I know that everything moving forward would be -- fall under that executive order.Q  Vice President Pence in a new story out of Indiana -- it was revealed that he used a private email server --MS. SANDERS: Actually, it was --Q  -- or a private email account --MS. SANDERS: Very different.Q  Sorry. A private email account, but it was hacked. How is that different from what Hillary Clinton did? What's the difference?MS. SANDERS: There's lightyears of difference. Number one, he was a governor -- he wasn't a federal employee, which means the laws are different. It's subject to Indiana law, not federal law. Second, he's a governor, which means he wasn't handling classified information like she was. And third, all of his emails he turned over specifically to be archived, which is why anybody even knows about the account. He did everything to the letter of the law in Indiana, turned all of his emails over, unlike Hillary Clinton who lost at least 30,000, who knows how many more, had a private server, and had classified information, which he didn't have. I mean, that's an apples-to-oranges comparison.Q  Sarah, on Russia and Sessions, is the President --MS. SANDERS: I can't believe it took us that long.Q  I know, right?MS. SANDERS: Goodness.Q  Is the President satisfied that recusal is enough for the Attorney General? He seemed to say in his statement he didn't even think that that should have happened and yet the Attorney General took that step on his own. And there are reports about other members of the President's campaign staff that had also had connections --MS. SANDERS: Campaign volunteers, but yes.Q  -- who have been volunteers. I mean, at what point is there a ""there"" there, as Sean said there wasn't. I mean, at what point is -- I mean, there's so much out there.MS. SANDERS: Is there really? I mean, please explain to me how volunteers meeting at a conference where nearly 80 ambassadors attended is a story. I guess that part is kind of lost on me where that would be newsworthy in any capacity. I mean, Chuck Schumer sitting, having drinks with Putin and that's not a news story, but apparently a volunteer for a campaign bumping into one at a conference where there's, again, dozens of other ambassadors is newsworthy, I guess.Q  Jeff Sessions was more than a campaign volunteer, right?MS. SANDERS: As a senator, he obviously in his official capacity met with the ambassador but, again, that was a senator, not as a campaign official. And so to try to muddy the waters in that way is I think pretty unfair to the Attorney General. Q  Why is the administration just now telling people about the meeting with Kislyak at Trump Tower? It seems like a little late, given that there was all this stuff about whether Flynn had had conversations with him.MS. SANDERS: Look, I think this, again, was a courtesy meeting. They were part of over a hundred different meetings during the transition. This wasn't like a secret -- it was just -- frankly, I didn't know about it and so I don't think anybody saw it as a big deal. There was no policy discussion. It was an introductory, courtesy meeting, which we did literally hundreds over the course of the transition.Q  With other ambassadors? How many other ambassadors?MS. SANDERS: I would have to get a specific number, but I know that there were dozens of other ambassadors.Q  There were a number of reporters who are staked out at Trump Tower watching people go up the elevators. No one saw the Russian ambassador. Did he use a separate entrance? And if so, why?MS. SANDERS: Im not sure, but Ill check and find out, and let you guys know.Q  To go back to Pence and the email issue for a second, is the White House certain that hes not using personal email as Vice President? And has the White House sort of checked in with all the Cabinet Secretaries and people to talk to them about using personal email versus government email?MS. SANDERS: Yeah, I know that weve all had the training on security and ethics training, and Im also -- I will ask specifically that question, but I know that the Vice President is following the law as its required by him.Q  Can you say one thing on the education event today -- Nancy DeVos and her --Q  Betsy.Q  Im sorry -- Betsy DeVos, sorry, and her support for school choice has obviously been controversial with teachers unions, with a lot of the Democrats. Is this a sort of kickoff for the President in his push to try to help her adopt school choice nationwide?MS. SANDERS: I think the point of today is exactly what it says -- its a listening session. Its to talk about ideas and reforms that have worked, particularly at this school, which I think you guys will get the opportunity to see that. Look, the number-one priority for education with the President has been consistent from day one. It hasnt changed, and thats to make the power and the central focus be more on the parents and the local level, and less at the federal level. And today is part of that process.Q  Is there any legislation or anything that he is going to pushing on that?MS. SANDERS: Not as of today. Well certainly keep you guys posted if were making any legislative announcements or bill signings.Q  There are reports that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is visiting the White House later this month. Can you confirm that today?MS. SANDERS: Yes, she will be there. I believe the date is March 14th, and that is confirmed.Q  What will they be discussing?MS. SANDERS: Im not going to get ahead of their conversations, but well certainly provide readouts after that meeting. And I believe we plan to have a press conference with that, and they can address that directly.Q  The New York Times story about the debate over climate change and the Paris climate deal, whether the President is going to pull the U.S. out of that deal -- can you tell us where the Presidents mind is on that, and if were expecting an announcement anytime soon?MS. SANDERS: Again, Im not going to get ahead of the President, and he hasnt made an announcement on that, but you guys are always the first to know.Q  Can you talk a little bit about the RNC event tonight? What the President is going to do or say there, and anything else that hes going to do this weekend?MS. SANDERS: Sure. I know that its a fundraiser. This will be the first fundraiser he has attended as President. And its -- as you would imagine -- like pretty much every other fundraiser. The goal is to raise money for the Republican Party, and I dont expect tonight to be any different.Q  Is there any access for us?MS. SANDERS: I dont think so, as of now. I think the standard policy has usually been not to have press at fundraisers, but Ill check and let you guys know. Q  And anything else this weekend?MS. SANDERS: I know we have some other stuff. Stephanie, who will be with you guys through the rest of the weekend, will keep you posted throughout Sunday.Q  Any update on the travel ban EO?MS. SANDERS: We dont have an announcement yet, but again, well let you know when were ready to roll that out.Q  Any portions of his schedule for next week that you can preview today?MS. SANDERS: I think we will have a week-ahead guidance later tonight, and so well get that to you guys then.Anything else?Q  More on Sessions and Russia: The President said he learned about this, as the rest of us were learning, through media reports. Same thing with Flynn. He didnt know about the calls and the fact that they were discussing sanctions. Does the President feel like he has a full understanding of what his campaign, what his staffers, what his administration has done in terms of its relationship with Russia? Is there anything that the President feels that he doesnt know yet?MS. SANDERS: I dont think so, and I think the big point here is that the President himself knows what his involvement was, and thats zero. And I think hes the primary person that should be held responsible, and he had no interaction, and I think thats what the story should be focused on.Thanks, guys.Q  Thank you, Sarah.MS. SANDERS: You bet.END 12:54 P.M. EST",21005.71,2.7399999999979627,5870.75,9.529999999999745,2383.12,1.199999999999818

263,2017-03-03,Remarks by President Trump in Parent-Teacher Conference Listening Session,"St. Andrew Catholic SchoolOrlando, Florida1:51 P.M. ESTPRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, first of all, I want to thank you very much. Great job. Really a fantastic job. We just did a tour. I was given a couple of beautiful cards by the students -- really well done. And I appreciate it.And Bishop Noonan, thank you so much. A very powerful man, and I -- the most powerful man, right? (Laughter.) And I appreciate it very much for your uplifting prayer. I have to say that your support of schools like St. Andrews Catholic School has been incredible. Everybody talks about it. They talk about you. You understand how much the students benefit from full education, one that enriches both the mind and the soul, a combination -- and that's a good combination.Latrina, I want to just thank you. The job you've done is incredible. Everyone -- we've been talking about you actually you have a big reputation in Florida. You do know that, right? (Laughter.) For your talent and a lot of other things. But I see it -- and for your love of what you do. Because I could see as soon as I met you, the love that you have for what you do is really fantastic. So I want to thank you very much.And Superintendent Fortier -- where is Superintendent? Where is Superintendent? You have been -- come here. You have been fantastic. And the job you're doing and willing to do is going to be -- I think with what's happening and with people like Marco and Rick Scott and the President and seeing this today -- I mean, it just -- it's going to get further and further because I know they're big fans.So I'm grateful to have everybody here today. I'm also very pleased and -- where is Rick Scott? Right over here, Governor Scott and Senator Marco Rubio and, as you know, Secretary DeVos -- she was approved a couple of weeks ago. And she's the one that we all report to when it comes to education. And I know you're going to have a fantastic relationship with the Secretary, and that's going to be a lot of good things for your school and for the entire system.St. Andrews Catholic School represents one of the many parochial schools dedicated to the education of some of our nation's most disadvantaged children. But they're becoming just the opposite very rapidly through education and with the help of the school choice programs. This month, we commemorate the thousands of peaceful activists for justice who joined Martin Luther King on the march from Selma to Montgomery. And that day, Reverend King hoped that inferior education would become, as he said, ""a thing of the past."" And we're going to work very much for the future and what he predicted would be with the future. As I've often said in my address to Congress and just about anyplace else I can speak, education is the civil rights issue of our time. And it's why I've asked Congress to support a school-choice bill. And we've come a long way. I think we really -- we're right out there and we're ahead of -- we're ahead of schedule in so many ways when it comes to education. And, again, Betsy is going to lead that -- you're going to lead that charge, right? SECRETARY DEVOS: You bet.THE PRESIDENT: You're going to do a fantastic job. Denisha Merriweather is with us today and you were so wonderful the other night.MS. MERRIWEATHER: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: That was quite a night. I will say that, Denisha. I was honored that Denisha joined Melania and myself as our guest to my address to Congress. Denisha is the first in her family to graduate high school and college, and is about to complete her master's degree in social work, right? (Applause.) And Denisha, we want millions more to have the same chance to achieve the great success that you're achieving right now. And you think that can be done, I'll bet, right?MS. MERRIWEATHER: Of course.THE PRESIDENT: Look at that. (Laughter.) Her eyes light up. And that's good news. So I want to thank all of the parents and teachers and students at St. Andrews and all of the graduates that are with us today. It's a special place. It's also a special state. Florida, to me, is a very, very special, special state. I mean, I know those people back there -- they know why I like it so much. We've had a lot of success in Florida and I love it. It's my second home. I'm here all the time. We have the Southern White House in Florida. (Laughter.) And we get a lot of work done -- believe me, there's not rest at the Southern White House -- it's all work. And we love this state. And we love this state, the way it's managed between Marco and Rick and some of the others. They're doing a great job and we appreciate it very much. And thank you. And thank you very much.

264,2017-03-03,Remarks by the Vice President on President Trump's Vision for the Future,"Blains Farm and Fleet Distribution CenterJanesville, Wisconsin12:35 P.M. CSTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Hello, Wisconsin! AUDIENCE: Hello!THE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much. Thank you to my friend, Speaker Paul Ryan, for your wonderful introduction. It is great to be in Janesville, the home of the Speaker of the House of the United States of America. (Applause.) Janesville has almost taken on an epic category in America because what works in Janesville will work for the American people. And Im just delighted to be with all of you today. And Im deeply humbled by the esteem expressed by my friend and your neighbor, Paul Ryan. And let me just assure you, people all across America are grateful to the people of Janesville for continuing to send Speaker Paul Ryan to Washington, D.C. So thank you for that. (Applause.) I also understand that your mom, Betty, is here. Where is mom at? Can mom take a bow? Would you mind standing up? Paul Ryans mom, everybody. This is a big deal. Turn around and wave at the media. (Applause.) Wonderful to see you and thank you for being with us today. The President and I are grateful for your sons principled leadership in the House of Representatives. It seems like just yesterday, 16 years ago, when I arrived in Washington, D.C. -- just a couple of years after Paul arrived there. We were both young and dashing congressmen. (Laughter.) And one of us changed -- (laughter) -- and one of us looks exactly like he did the day you sent him.But Im deeply humbled to call your congressmen and our Speaker my friend. And I know for a fact that, Paul, your partnership with this administration is going to benefit the American people for generations to come, and were grateful. (Applause.) Would you mind just giving him one of those standing ovations that you gave out to a few of us? He sure does deserve it. (Applause.) Also, its really great to be back in Wisconsin. Thanks to all of you, your hard work, your support and your prayers, Wisconsin voted to make Donald Trump the 45th President of the United States of America, and he and I couldnt be more grateful. (Applause.) It was quite a campaign. And its already been quite an administration too, hasnt it? (Laughter.) How many of you watched the Presidents address to the Congress on Tuesday night, show of hands. How about that? What you saw three nights ago is literally what I see every day -- the boundless optimism, the energy and unshakeable faith in the American people and the ability of the American people to make America great again. Thats what you saw, and thats what inspired the nation. (Applause.) Its deeply humbling for me to serve as Vice President of the United States. Im just a small-town guy from southern Indiana. My grandfather actually immigrated to this country, came over on a boat from Ireland, went through Ellis Island and drove a bus in Chicago for 40 years. I was actually named after my grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley. Thats who Michael Richard Pence got his name from. I mean, I cant imagine what my grandfather is thinking about looking down from glory, except that hes very surprised about his grandson. (Laughter.) But also that he was right. He was right about America. Because anybody can be anybody in the land of the free and the home of the brave. And its a joy to be with you today.And its a joy for me to serve as Vice President in this country because America has a President with broad shoulders and a big heart. And speaking of which, on behalf of the President of the United States, let me say thank you, Wisconsin, for your support for our new Commander-in-Chief and our new President, Donald Trump. (Applause.) It was hardworking Americans like all of you who were some of our biggest supporters. Communities just like Janesville were really the wellspring of support for President Donald Trump in this campaign. And on his behalf, I want to thank you for that support, and thank you for being here today. Its a privilege to be joined by a couple other people I want to mention before I get to the body of my remarks. I hope you can sense the caliber, the character, the experience, and the extraordinary confidence that our new secretary of Health and Human Services brings to this task. Dr. Tom Price, President Trump and I and people across this country are grateful that you have stood up to fill this important role in the life of our nation at such a time as this. Would you thank him again? (Applause.)And Im also honored to be joined today by another great, dedicated public servant. Senator Ron Johnson, thank you for being here, thank you for your great leadership, and congratulations. (Applause.) Congratulations on the renewal of your six-year contract here in Wisconsin. We couldnt be more pleased.But I also want to thank all the business leaders who are with us today, including and maybe most especially, our host, Jane Blain Gilbertson, and the Blains Farm and Fleet team. What an awesome company. What an awesome leader. What a great American success story. (Applause.) Jane got together all these great people from here in Janesville, and we did some listening today, didnt we? As Paul said, we listened to the local farmers, and builders, and job creators. I really enjoyed our discussion, and I appreciate the candid feedback that you shared with us that well carry back to Washington, D.C.But last but not least, let me just say thanks -- thanks to all of you here who are part of this incredible Farm and Fleet team. The employees and the families that came out today -- you are the backbone of our economy, of our country, of Janesville, and the President, the Speaker, and all of us are grateful for your character, your work ethic, and all you do to make this a great place to live, and to work, and to raise a family. Give yourselves a round of applause, folks. (Applause.)But Im grateful to be here to talk about family business. The President and I are going to continue to work tirelessly on behalf of small businesses across this country because I grew up in a small-business family, in a small-business town. My dad was in the gas station business. I worked at a gas station as a gas station attendant -- had my name on my shirt, right. Little blue short-sleeve shirt, when I was only fourteen years of age, and used to -- for those of you that are a little bit younger, a gas station attendant -- (laughter) -- if you could imagine, if you pulled into a gas station and someone came running toward your car, and filled it up, and washed the windshield, and checked the tires, and didnt charge you any more money for it. That was where I grew up in a small business.And as the world knows, the President grew up in a family business too. I mean, he and I both know the sacrifices that are required for a small family business in communities like where I grew up, Queens where he grew up and in -- and right here in Janesville -- long hours, hard work. And we both know the fundamental truth of our economy: When small business is strong, America is strong, and were going fight every day for small business America. (Applause.)President Trump and I want you to become stronger than ever, and Ill tell you what right now. President Donald Trump is the best friend Wisconsin businesses will ever have. (Applause.) You might have gotten that impression Tuesday night, just a couple days ago. He actually talked about an employer up here. I dont know if you heard about Harley-Davidson -- (laughter) -- here in Wisconsin. The President actually hosted Harley-Davidson at the White House. It was an honor for me to join him. And you saw him talk about that in his speech to the Congress. And companies like Blain's Farm and Fleet are the engines of the economy, Harley-Davidson, and as President Trump said, whether it's going to be to kick start that engine or turn the key of that engine, we're going to restart the engine of the American economy and create jobs and prosperity and growth like never before. I promise you that. (Applause.)In fact, exactly what he's doing -- it's, in fact, already happening. On day one, he went right to work on doing job-destroying policies and executive orders of the -- eight years. After years of delays, for instance, President Trump authorized the construction of the Keystone and Dakota pipelines, creating thousands of American jobs and strengthening our energy infrastructure. (Applause.) He signed legislation, thanks to the Congress and Speaker Ryan and Senator Johnson, he signed legislation already to roll back reams of red tape and he's instructed every agency in Washington, D.C., to find two regulations to get rid of before they issue any new regulations on businesses and entrepreneurs in America. (Applause.)He's taken decisive action to end illegal immigration once and for all to strengthen our borders and uphold the laws of the United States of America. (Applause.) And businesses around America are already reacting and responding to President Trump's call to buy American and hire American, and they're doing that with optimism and investment all across the country. Literally from coast to coast, and especially here in the Midwest, companies are announcing they're keeping jobs and creating new ones -- tens of thousands of jobs literally since Election Day. It's not just the stock market that's taken a positive leap forward, but companies like Ford Motor Company, just next door in Michigan, recently announced that they were not going to do a plant in Mexico and, instead, they were going to expand a plant in Michigan. And they called it a ""vote of confidence"" in President Donald Trump and his vision for America. And other businesses are joining them. (Applause.)I've got to tell you, this administration has the biggest, boldest and best agenda this country has ever seen, and we're going to pass it with the support of Speaker Ryan and our great leadership in the House and in the Senate, from top to bottom. And let me make you a promise: The Obamacare nightmare is about to end. (Applause.) Despite the best efforts of some activists and town hall meetings around the country, the truth of the matter is the American people know -- Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go. (Applause.)I heard it today. (Applause.) I heard it today. I don't know if we're going to stop by Italian House later -- (laughter) -- but I'm hungry. (Laughter.) AUDIENCE MEMBER: Now we're not. (Laughter.)THE VICE PRESIDENT: Paul said, ""Now we're not."" (Laughter.) Can't announce that stuff in advance. (Laughter.) But come on, Edmund, do you got, like, a to-go thing or something there? (Laughter.) Would that be all right? Can I get Italian House to go? Would that be all right with everybody, man? (Applause.)We were just hearing from Edmund a minute ago -- he's a great employer, a great American success story here in Janesville, but he talked about the weight that Obamacare has placed on his great family-owned business. And it's a weight that's been placed on businesses and employers all across this country, let alone the weight it's placed on American families.I mean, literally, it literally is just a long list of broken promises, isn't it? I mean, remember all the promises about Obamacare? They told you the cost of health insurance would go down, right? Not true. They told us if you like your doctor, you could keep him. Not true. They told us if you like your health insurance plan, you could keep it. Not true. I mean, talk about your fake news. I mean, the truth is -- the truth is just virtually every promise of Obamacare has been broken.Today, Americans are paying $3,000 a year more on average for their health insurance than when Obamacare was passed into law. And premiums are skyrocketing -- last year by more than 25 percent on average around the country, millions have lost their plans and lost their doctors. And not only that, Obamacare, as Edmund was describing, is a job-killer, and everybody knows it.The last few years, it's been hard enough to get ahead and Obamacare has only made it much harder and, in many ways, if not impossible for many small businesses. The endless premium hikes, the reams of red tape eat up time and money that would be better spent growing your business and benefitting your workers. And every year the burden grows, so do the hard choices that you have to make. But not for long. I'm going to make you a promise -- you heard the President say it -- and give direction to the Congress. And it's just going to start happening in just a few days. We're going to repeal Obamacare once and for all, and eliminate all its mandates and taxes and intrusion into your personal lives and into the lives of your business. (Applause.)And best of all -- best of all, the President directed the Congress right after that election today to -- at the same time that we repeal Obamacare, we're going to replace it with something that actually works and lowers the cost of health insurance for every American. (Applause.) The President and I want every American to have access to quality, affordable health insurance. That's why we're going to pass a better law that lowers the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government. And we've got an incredible team working literally every single day around the clock to get that done. In Secretary Price, America has one of the leading experts on healthcare in the country -- I hope you picked up he's a medical doctor. (Laughter.) All right? I mean, how many times in Washington -- this is only the third time in the history of the Department of Health and Human Services that a physician has led that Department. The President and I are working with him, with Speaker Ryan and his outstanding team in the House of Representatives with Leader McConnell, Senator Johnson, with all of our leaders in Congress, and we're putting the finishing touches on our plan, even as this weekend rolls out. A better plan for a brighter future that's built on a foundation of individual freedom and personal responsibility will replace Obamacare. (Applause.)The President talked about it the other night, but you know the outlines -- we're going to give Americans the freedom to buy health insurance that's best for you and end the era of government-mandated health insurance in this country. We're going to let you buy health insurance across state lines, the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance. That's how you bring down the cost of health insurance -- you create a national marketplace and then you get that little lizard and you get Flo on television -- (laughter) -- and let them start selling cheaper health insurance to every American. That's the American way. (Applause.)We'll make also -- make sure, I promise you, that Americans struggling with preexisting conditions have access to the coverage and the care that they need. And we'll give states the flexibility and the freedom and the resources they need to take care of our most vulnerable. You know, just the other day, I was talking to one of my favorite elected officials in America, Governor Scott Walker. (Applause.) I mean, what is in the water here in Wisconsin? Governor Scott Walker is not only leading the association of fellow governors of his party across the country, but he's a recognized national leader and I'm honored to call him a friend.As a former governor myself, he and I both know that every state is unique. The challenges here in Wisconsin are different than they are down in Illinois, different than they are in the state of Indiana, Minnesota. And what Scott Walker is doing is he's pulled together governors from around the country, we met last weekend in Washington, D.C. And we're working on ensuring that when we repeal and replace Obamacare, that we're going to allow states to have the flexibility to craft state-based solutions that will work for the people of their individual states. What will work in Wisconsin is better designed by the people of Wisconsin for the needs of the most vulnerable in this state. And Im grateful for his leadership. (Applause.) And despite what the other side is saying, all the -- creating anxiety for Americans, the President said it last fall in Philadelphia, he said it again this week: Were going to have an orderly transition to a better healthcare system that finally puts the American people first. So its about healthcare right out of the gate. And our 45th President has said thats the number-one priority, and were going right to work on it in just a matter of days. But President Trumps agenda doesnt stop there. I could keep you here the rest of the afternoon to tell you about all the things the President planned, but let me touch on a few. I loved it when he was out campaigning in Wisconsin and I was a little bit myself. President Trump, you see, had a three-part agenda: Jobs, jobs and jobs. And this President is going to get this economy moving again by passing the biggest package of tax relief since the days of Ronald Reagan. (Applause.) With the strong support of Speaker Ryan and Senator Ron Johnson, were going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms. Were also going to keep rolling back job-killing regulations, rein in unelected bureaucrats so they cant cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desks in Washington, D.C.Were going to end wasteful government spending and restore fiscal responsibility to our nations capital. Were going to pass an infrastructure package so that America, once again, has the best roads, bridges, highways, airports that weve ever had in the history of this nation. (Applause.) President Trump and I believe that roads mean jobs. And not just road jobs; when you have the right infrastructure, this builder whos become President knows the right investments and the right infrastructure is going to make for a more prosperous Wisconsin and a more prosperous America. And, ladies and gentlemen, make no mistake about it: Thanks to President Trump, this economy is going to grow faster than ever before. But making America great again also means restoring safety to our streets, keeping our country secure, and President Trump hasnt wasted any time on that either. Ill tell you what, in my lifetime, I couldnt be more proud, because Ive never seen at this level -- and they know it -- President Trump stands with the men and women who serve in law enforcement all across this country like no one Ive ever met. (Applause.) Were going to stand with those men and women who keep our communities safe every single day. And were going to continue to take steps to make sure that people that are coming into this country dont represent a threat to our families or to our way of life.President Trump is standing tall with our allies, standing up to our enemies. Hes also working to rebuild our military. Im the proud father of a United States Marine. (Applause.) And truth of the matter, in recent years, weve seen budget cuts that have failed to provide our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines with the resources that they need to do their jobs. Thats all about to change.Under President Donald Trump, with the leadership of this Congress, were going to rebuild our military. Were going to restore the arsenal of democracy. Were going to make sure our armed forces have the resources and training they need to protect our nation starting right now. (Applause.) My friends, President Trump is keeping his promises, promises he made to the people of Wisconsin and promises he made to the American people. And that includes one of his most consequential promises. Out on the campaign trail, there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States. The President said that he would promise to name someone to the Supreme Court in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia. And I promise you, in Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Trump has kept his word to nominate a jurist who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the United States of America. And we look forward to him being confirmed by the United States Senate. (Applause.) Healthcare reform, tax reform, regulatory reform, taking steps to make America secure, ensuring that the highest court in the land upholds our highest ideals. Thats what it looks like to make America great again. And President Trump is fighting to make that happen every single day, every single moment. And were going to continue fighting. Now, were hearing from plenty who want to stick with the status quo, whether it be on healthcare or other issues -- whether its the media, the establishment, insiders and the rest, they have no problem standing in the way of change. But trust me, whatever challenges face us today, were going stay in the promise-keeping business. And President Trump is going to deliver on this moment for the people of the United States of America. And were going to make America more prosperous again. Were going to have a better healthcare system that respects the doctor-patient relationship and harnesses the power of the private marketplace. Were going to make America safe again. And with your help and with Gods help, I promise you, Wisconsin, I promise you, Janesville, were going to make America great again. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming out today. And just God bless you. God bless America. (Applause.)END12:58 P.M. CST",21005.71,2.7399999999979627,5870.75,9.529999999999745,2383.12,1.199999999999818

268,2017-03-06,Press Gaggle by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:47 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everybody. Another quiet weekend. (Laughter.) Q  You sure you dont want to do this on camera? (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: The President signed a new executive order this morning that continues to protect the nation from terrorists entering into the United States, and a related presidential memorandum. As we've always maintained, the executive order was fully lawful in the first place, and we would have won the related legal cases on the merits. But rather than leave Americas security in limbo while the litigation dragged on, some estimates having that go up to potentially a year, the President acted to protect the national security by issuing a new executive order that addresses the courts concerns, some of which merely involve clarifying the intent of the original executive order.After reviewing the facts and in thorough consultation with the Cabinet, the President had concluded these actions are necessary to protect the United States from those who, unfortunately, wish to do us harm.Two areas that I want to highlight in the executive order. There will be a 90-day suspension of travel to the United States by nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, during which time the Department of State and Homeland Security will conduct a review to determine how we can improve the screening process for foreign nationals seeking to enter the United States. These six countries have been previously identified by Congress and the Obama administration as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism. Specifically, Iran, Sudan and Syria have been designated as state sponsors of terrorism. Libya is an active combat zone where violent extremist groups thrive in ungoverned territory. Portions of Somalia have been a safe haven for terrorist groups. Most countries don't even recognize the Somali documents. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the government and Iran-backed armed opposition. Both ISIS and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and carry out hundreds of attacks. These governments simply cannot or not adequately supply satisfactory information about their own nationals. In the absence of adequate information from these governments, the President has had to act to protect the security of the American people.After the original executive order, Iraqs government took steps to increase their cooperation with our immigration authorities and improve their vetting process, leading them to be removed from the list of countries covered by the temporary travel suspension. We hope other countries will also take proactive action to ensure the security of all of our nations.This is proof of both the need for and the effectiveness of the Presidents actions. There are a number of exceptions to this temporary travel suspension. The order explicitly states that the suspension does not apply to, one, green card holders; two, foreign nationals currently in the U.S.; three, foreign nationals currently holding valid visas; four, foreign nationals who are dual citizens of a designated country traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country; and last, foreign nationals who have been granted asylum or admitted as refugees previously.There will also be a temporary 120-day suspension of the United States refugees admissions program. More than 300 people who have entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the FBI. We must find a way to better screen refugee applicants to maintain the safety of our own communities.This suspension will temporarily reduce the investigative burdens on the agencies that participate in our refugee program, allowing them to properly review and revise their standards and practices.In regard to both of these provisions, the President places his full faith and trust in the experience and knowledge of his Secretary of State and his Secretary of Homeland Security. This order makes it clear that they have broad authority to grant waivers based on their expert judgments. This suspension does not apply to refugees already scheduled for travel by the Department of State, which is explicitly stated in the text of the executive order. Additionally, this suspension does not treat Syrian refugees different than any other refugees. It does not separately address the persecution of religious minorities, but does permit waivers in the cases of undue hardship.This order was drafted in close consultation with the relevant agencies. It also includes a delay-effective date of March 16th, giving those involved in its enforcement even more time to facilitate an orderly rollout. We welcome those who come to our country wishing to contribute and share in our nations prosperity and wellbeing, but we cannot allow our immigration system to become a vehicle for admitting people who intend to do us harm. It is the Presidents solemn duty to protect the American people, and President Trump has taken an important step in securing our borders through this order.Moving on to today, the President had a full day of meetings with the Cabinet and members of his staff. The President received his intelligence briefing this morning. He had a call earlier with the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, where they discussed regional security challenges. The Prime Minister thanked the President for his strong stance on anti-Semitism during his joint address to Congress last week. The President had lunch with the Vice President, and, as Im speaking to you now, he is beginning a meeting with the Secretary of State. Later today, hell have meetings with his National Economic Council and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Shulkin. This evening, hell have dinner with OMD Director Mulvaney and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price, where he will talk about the repeal-and-replace efforts regarding Obamacare.With that, Ill be glad to take a few questions. Q  Follow-up on the executive order? Have you told --MR. SPICER: John Roberts.Q  Thank you. (Laughter.) You told us -- I figured since its just a gaggle -- you told us many times that the President was going to continue with the case in Seattle federal court, yet paragraph 13 in the new EO says hes going to revoke the original one. What changed?MR. SPICER: As you know, he met with his team over the weekend down in Mar-a-Lago -- general counsel, Secretary Sessions, Secretary Kelly, Stephen Miller, other members of the team -- where they discussed -- continued discussing the current executive order, as well as the strategy. And they made a determination that it was best to pursue this track.And again, I think, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, we continue to maintain that the order was fully lawful but there were some legal hurdles that wed have to potentially cross in terms of enjoinment and things like that. So it was discussed with the President Saturday, and he made a decision that this was how he wanted to proceed going forward, based on the advice and counsel of his team.Q  DOJ has informed the 9th circuit of the existence of the new executive order. Will they move to dismiss the 48 cases that are facing that original order? MR. SPICER: Thats a good question. I know that theres the issue of both the 9th circuit and then the other ones. And Ill have to get back to you on that. I dont know what posture theyre going to take, so well go forward.Margaret.Q  I was just going to say, would you be able to let all of us --MR. SPICER: Oh, yeah, Im sorry. Yeah, Id be glad to let everybody know. Q  Ive got a question too but I can wait until hes finished, its fine.MR. SPICER: John, are you done?Q  Oh, Im done.MR. SPICER: Okay. See how much nicer this is? Margaret.Q  Oh, thank you. Well, actually Id like to move away from this subject to the other subject.MR. SPICER: Sure.Q  Is the President going to clarify what he meant when he accused President Obama and White House officials of doing wiretaps? Is that what he meant, or did he mean that he thinks there were wiretaps that the FBI authorized? And does he want to kind of, like, amend his previous statement?MR. SPICER: I think the statement that we issued yesterday where -- President Donald J. Trump is requesting as part of the investigation of Russian activity that congressional intelligence committees exercise their oversight authority to determine whether executive branch investigative powers were abused in 2016. Neither the White House nor the President will comment further until such oversight is continued. He wants Congress to look into this. Ive spoken to the President again today. He would ask that they, additionally, look into this issue of leaks of classified and other information coming from the government. He believes that it undermines our national security and that Congress -- the intelligence communities in Congress, using their oversight authority, look into these pervasive leaks of national security -- of classified information. So he would do that. I would note, its interesting that when you look at what former DNI Clapper said on Meet the Press, when he was asked if there was any evidence that the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russian government while the Kremlin was working to influence the election, his quote was, Not to my knowledge. I think weve continued to see people who have been briefed and are aware of these stories that have existed -- Congressman Chairman Nunes of the Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton of the -- hes on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Richard Burr, Marco Rubio -- you name it, on and on and on, have said that the information that theyve been provided -- and this is -- I get it, theres two separate issues here. But I think on the first one, you saw over and over again the continued comments by people who are in the know or have been in the know on that situation saying that there was no knowledge. Conversely, you saw former Attorney General Mukasey come out and talk about -- that its pretty clear that there was some sort of surveillance or wiretaps that had to have existed.All that being said, I think thats why the President is asking Congress, the intelligence committees to use their oversight authority to further understand whats in this.Im sorry. Q  And so --MR. SPICER: Im not sorry but I knew you --Q  No, no, no -- yeah. Just before we move on -- okay, so for now, the President is not amending what he tweeted.MR. SPICER: No.Q  And Jim Comey, in the meantime, I guess wanted Justice to knock it down. Has the President talked to Jim Comey?MR. SPICER: Ill be honest with you, I have not seen anything aside from another report based on anonymous sources that that actually happened. So aside from anonymous sources saying that a conversation happened, Im not aware that that occurred. I dont know that were aware that that occurred. And I, frankly, dont see anything on the record that show that that actually occurred.So just to be clear, this is one of the problems that I think occurred in the whole first set of stories. People start taking things as fact because a series of off-the-record and anonymous sources say they do. We have started to become a series of believing all of these stories, and yet -- Ive addressed this in the past -- theres nothing there to substantiate it. In fact, all of the people, from -- I mean, Clappers comment, Not to my knowledge. You saw Nunes, Rubio, all these senators and House members that have been briefed by the FBI coming out and saying, we have not seen anything, either. At some point, I would ask people to take on-the-record sources and quotes as important as the countless numbers of anonymous off-the-records.Zeke. Oh, Im sorry --Q  Sean --MR. SPICER: No, no, no, I just saw the top of a head. Hallie, Im going to get to you, dont worry. Im sorry, that was my bad. Q  Its okay, its all right. So explain this to me, then. Youre talking about not using anonymous sources. What is, then, the sourcing for the Presidents tweet on Saturday morning?MR. SPICER: As I said, I think, look --Q  And does he believe its a FISA warrant. Is it some other -- of surveillance?MR. SPICER: It could be FISA. It could be surveillance. Theres no cameras, slow it down.Q  So he doesnt know?MR. SPICER: Look, I think he has made it clear that there are continued reports that have been out there. Im not going to continue to -- I think the President made it clear yesterday that he wants Congress to go in and look at this. I think there is substantial reporting out there from individuals and from sources.Q  But what sources --MR. SPICER: Okay. Sara, youre not on camera. You dont need to jump in. Well get to your question in turn. Hold on. The answer is, is that the President has made it clear he wants Congress to look into this. And were encouraging the House and Senate intelligence committees to use their oversight capabilities and look into this.John Gizzi.Q  Sean, does he not know whether -- what kind of surveillance it was?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that theres no question that something happened. The question is, is it surveillance, is it a wiretap, or whatever. But theres been enough reporting that strongly suggests that something occurred. And I think that thats why what he has said yesterday is that he wants Congress to look into this. And I think that there is enough out there now that makes one wonder how some of this happened without the existence of surveillance.Q  But when he published his tweet --MR. SPICER: Right.Q  -- did he know what kind of surveillance?MR. SPICER: All Im telling -- like I said, Im going to put a pin in this and say, the statement yesterday made it very clear that he wants House and Senate Intelligence Committee members to use their oversight authority to look into this situation.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. Has the President ever said theres hypocrisy and a double standard in the reporting of things? For example, about alleged Russian involvement in U.S. elections, and then on the other hand, relatively little attention paid to the leaking of conversations with world leaders that are classified? And does the leaking of his conversations with world leaders bother him and make him want to investigate that as well?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, I think he is very concerned about that. There is obviously information that affects national security that has been leaked out that concerns him. I mean, its -- and I think when youve seen some of the leader calls being leaked out that are sort of congratulatory or not necessarily dealing with state secrets or national security, thats one thing to seem -- but it gives you pause and concern to realize that, if youre talking about something of national security, of something that affects two of our different economies or countries, that -- whether its China or North Korea, whether youre actually talking to them or talking about them with another leader, that there is obviously concern that those calls are getting leaked out. And I think thats why the President is also now asking Congress to additionally use its oversight authorities to also look at those leaks and wonder why thats happening. So I think he is concerned. I think weve said it several times before, and its obviously something that is of major concern. And, frankly, when you recognize the potential that that could have on the safety of our country, it should give everyone pause.Hallie.Q  Sean, two topics for you here. I want to clarify some questions again from my colleagues. Has the President spoken with the FBI director about the allegations he made Saturday morning, and does he have confidence in his FBI?MR. SPICER: To the best of my knowledge, Im almost 100 percent certain that he has not, but Ive not specifically asked him. Im not aware that that occurred. Obviously Ill give myself -- and Id be glad to get back, but I have not known that that existed. So Im giving myself the ability to get back to you on this, but Im not --Q  And all of us.MR. SPICER: And all of you. Were making a list. But I am not aware that that actually happened.Q  And the confidence question. Does he have confidence in his director?MR. SPICER: Theres nothing that I have been told by him that would lead me to believe that anything is different than when it was prior.Q  And before I get to the second topic, a clarification here. Youre talking about the President wanting to go to Congress, specifically on the wiretapping question, but this is information that is held by the executive branch. So why would the President, if its information the executive branch has --MR. SPICER: Because I think that theres -- like, again, and Im not going to -- I want to stay in my wheelhouse here. But my understanding is, is that the President directing the Department of Justice to do something with respect to an investigation that may or may not occur with evidence may be seen as trying to interfere. And I think that were trying to do this in the proper way, and thats --Q  So his tweets about it -- sort of saying that this information exists does not --MR. SPICER: That doesnt interfere with an investigation.So, Zeke.Q  Okay, the second topic was actually on the immigration executive order. The President back in January tweeted about a one-week delay on the travel ban, would have let bad dudes enter the country. This particular revised order doesnt go into effect for another 10 days.MR. SPICER: The 16th.Q  So what changed? How does that under -- does that undercut your argument that the nation was at risk?MR. SPICER: Well, I would argue that the court kind of undercut our argument by not reading the U.S. code the way its intended to. But I think we lost the element of surprise way back when we said we were going to issue a second executive order.Q  So thats what it was about, the element of surprise?MR. SPICER: Oh, absolutely. I think we said at the beginning. The whole reason that we did it in the way that we did was because if you -- started to telegraph it. But I think that when we started talking about a second executive order a couple of weeks back, I think that that generally took away -- whether it was done on Friday or Sunday or Monday, it wouldnt have mattered. And people have been able to -- we have telegraphed what were doing for the last couple weeks. We took that away, and the President, as youve seen, has been very methodical about making sure weve talked about this for the last week --Q  Since the -- MR. SPICER: Right, but talking about implementing it correctly. And I think Saturday night, if you saw the group of individuals who were down in Florida sitting with him, this is part of that implementation process that weve been talking about, that we were continuing to tweak it, to get it ready to speed, overcome a lot of issues and concerns that had to get added in or out, and make sure that the government was properly -- but make no mistake, we lost the element of surprise back when we said -- when the court enjoined this in the 9th circuit, and then we had to go back to the drawing board and we talked about doing a second order. That was the intent of it the entire time. You lose that back then.Zeke.Q  Going back to the previous topic, the President calling for Congress to investigate these specific issues. Does that mean that the President is willing -- or is committing now to accepting the conclusions of these congressional investigations no matter what they say on anything? So because hes now calling for this investigation, he is now committing to accept the outcome?MR. SPICER: Well, I dont think you would ever just blanketly say Im going to accept any outcome. That doesnt matter what it is. You can go to court and -- it doesnt mean that you get found guilty or innocent that youre accepting the outcome, it means that youre agreeing that thats a legitimate -- but I think were going to let Congress work its will. I think if we have a problem with one of the conclusions, well let it be known.But I think that, for right now, the issue is, is that we think that thats the appropriate place for this to be looked into. And they have the resources, and they, themselves, have admitted that.Alexis.Q  Sean, can I ask two topics?MR. SPICER: Sure.Q  On this topic, let me just follow up. If members of Congress pursue an investigation that looks into surveillance in the way the President would like them to, and he believes that that surveillance is potentially against the law, they would make recommendations to the executive branch to pursue and prosecute anyone responsible for that. So their recommendations would come back to the Justice Department. So to ask the question again, would the President accept the recommendations of the legislative branch that potentially laws were broken and that those accusations should come back to the Justice Department to investigate?MR. SPICER: I think its hard to prejudge what theyre doing. Obviously, the reason that hes asking the House and Senate Intelligence Committee to go through this is because he thinks that they are the appropriate venues. They have the appropriate staff to look at them, and I think its an appropriate way of having that separation of powers, if you will, where its not asking -- directing the Department of Justice to do something that they may or may not be the ones conducting.But again, the reason I dont want to give a blanket statement, Alexis, isnt because Im trying to prejudge it. But I think that depending on a lot of things, you dont want to say, were going to accept every single thing they do. I think we definitely will have a lot of respect for what they do and what they look into, but I think to blanketly accept -- just say, were going to accept anything they say or do, might be a bit premature and not exactly the way to go.Q  And I had a healthcare question but before I do that, it was reported that the President was interested in having the White House Counsel pursue information that would help support the Presidents argument that he may have been under surveillance. Is it the case that the President has indeed asked Don McGhan to continue doing that? Or is he dropping that and --MR. SPICER: No, Don McGhan was never asked -- all Don Mcghan was ever asked to do was to review what options, if any, were available. Thats it. Just review internally and tell the President, this is whats -- but we made very clear to anyone who asked -- and if you know Don and the team here -- these are unbelievably talented lawyers. Theyre very skilled in understanding their -- where the bounds are, and would understand that any type of interference would be -- it was an internal review of what options, if any, were available. So its full stop.Q  And that was completed?MR. SPICER: That guidance was made available to the President. Q  Okay. Heres my healthcare question.MR. SPICER: It was also reported that the Presidents desire for speed with the administrations own Affordable Care Act replacement plan has kicked the ball to the OMB Director rather the HHS Secretary to complete that work and get it out this week. Who is in charge of actually completing that? Is it more now in the ball court of OMB rather than HHS? Or are they working together? How would you describe it, and is it still coming out this week?MR. SPICER: I believe it is coming out -- I have every intention that it comes out this week. But I think its a joint effort. I think Secretary Price is obviously the lead; its HHS. But Director Mulvaney, his time -- I mean, theyve both served in the House and were champions of budget issues. Obviously, theres a huge budgetary impact on that, and his understanding of the budget, his role here, and, obviously, his understanding of Congress makes Director Mulvaney a great partner.So its not a question of -- and this is the same issue that came up during the transition on trade. I think we have an unbelievably talented team -- everybody from Robert Lighthizer, when he gets confirmed as the U.S. Trade Rep, youve got Wilbur Ross at Commerce, Peter Navarro here -- its not an either/or thing. Its I think bringing the best and the brightest together to get something through.Obamacare and repealing and replacing it with something thats more accessible, affordable, more innovative is not something that just has to land in one persons hand. It can be covered -- and I think there are great partners and great teammates.Yes.Q  Yes, please, thank you, Sean. Im just wondering when you said that its pretty clear that there was some sort of intelligence or wiretaps and that thats why we need to move forward with an investigation, is that based on people speaking on the record, or anonymous sources?MR. SPICER: On the record. I think General Mukasey was very much on the record when he came to that conclusion. I think that when you -- anyway. I will leave it to Congress to further follow up on that.Q  And one more, if I may. The President has yet to announce the vast majority of his sub-Cabinet-level nominations, such as Ambassador to Japan. Does the White House have a long-term timeline for all the rest of these nominations?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think that you should -- theres a bunch of sub-Cabinet individuals and ambassadorships that should be coming out very soon. One of the things that I think -- Im glad you kind of gave me an opportunity to touch on personnel. There was a report the other day that of, like, the 1,927 positions that -- someone went through, I think one of the things that people have to recognize is -- we talked about this a lot during the transition. We had about 600 members of these beachhead teams that went in under a special hiring process -- that theyre able to be there for 120 days. For the most part, most of those people transition into Schedule C positions. Its not a given. It is not a default, meaning -- and I think we made it clear during the transition -- its not just if you showed up for the first 120 days you get to stay. But sort of -- they were chosen specifically because of their understanding of the issue, their expertise or their desire to serve in that particular capacity.And so we actually -- when you actually look at the numbers, we are well ahead, if not on par with -- were well ahead of almost every modern administration. I think were right on par with Obama 08. But you think about it, of the 1,927 or so positions, weve got over 600 of those individuals, and -- most of whom so far are looking like theyre fully going to convert to Schedule C. But they are performing the duties that would be done by a Schedule C.So when you look at the totality of what were doing, we were well ahead on the Cabinet. And again, one of the other things is, youve got Congress still holding up the Cabinet getting appointed. And so I think theres a degree to which Senate Democrats, before we get a lot of stones thrown at us about where we are on the rest, they havent even finished the job at hand of getting the full Cabinet.Jon Decker.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. Two questions on the executive order. With the first executive order, there was a lot of fanfare when the President signed that executive order; in the Oval Office today, not so much. We didnt see the President, no cameras, no pool. Why didnt he want to show us him signing this new executive order?MR. SPICER: I tweeted a picture out. Q  Thats your picture, thats not independent --Q  Well, I know -- from today. Yeah, thats your --MR. SPICER: I know, Im -- I think -- (laughter) -- there are three agencies that are dealing with -- to your point, we went through this. We talked about the courts issue, we talked about this ad nauseam; the President got asked about it over and over again. I think today was about the implementation of it, was about having the three Departments that are expressly named to implement this to talk about what theyre doing to implement it. And I think they did a phenomenal job about it.And thats what we wanted to highlight today, is the government getting it done. And the way that the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State were implementing the measures that the President laid forth -- again, if you think about it, the principles of the executive order remain the same. We looked at what the court said, we put together a thing -- we consulted with the relevant agencies and Departments. We talked to Congress. We had an extensive morning of briefings. The call to the press lasted about an hour, I guess.And so we made sure that everybody knew what we were doing. We sent them out to make sure that the American people could see what they were doing. And so I just want to be clear that I think we did a phenomenal job of rolling it out and making sure the American people saw the faces of the Departments that were instrumental in implementing it. Im sorry, Jon, go ahead.Q  Thats all right. The second one has to do with this idea of element of surprise. With the first executive order and also with this one, theres a 90-day temporary ban on residents entering this country from six predominantly Muslim countries. Whats to stop a so-called bad dude from one of these countries from coming into the country on the 91st day, or the 92nd day? Why 90 days? Doesnt that get rid of that element of surprise when you say --MR. SPICER: No, I think that -- no, but -- thank you, thats actually an interesting question. I think part of it is, is that we feel confident that during that 90-day period, the processes could be put in place.Now, remember, theres two key things that are important. Number one is these six countries are the ones that we dont have the information currently that we feel comfortable -- and as I lifted off why -- I mean, there are some that literally are state-sponsors of terror. And I think when you recognize -- I dont think theres any American that wants a country that is a state-sponsor of terror to be sending their individuals here without us properly vetting them.You talk about Yemen, the documents that people use in Yemen are not accepted by a whole host of countries because they lack the integrity to ensure that they are not compromised. And I think that there is a big difference in that, but we can -- at the end of that 90-day period, we can let a country off, we can expand the list of countries, we could indefinitely address the countries that are on the list, we could expand that list to other countries that arent on it.But theres two things that are happening. One is, were putting a ban on those countries, the six that are named. But two is, were looking at an entire -- at the rest of the entire world, and all of the procedures that we use to address all countries.And so at the end of that period, we could add countries. We could subtract countries. We could decide to indefinitely continue with one of the two -- one of the six, rather. But if you look at the case of Iraq, after the first order, they stepped up with four very specific things that they did to ensure that people traveling from Iraq, we had certain things -- whether it be biometrics and others -- that let us ensure that people coming into the country, we felt confident in knowing that they were coming in.But thats an important thing. Its not just those six. Were looking at that time -- were dealing with those during that 90-day -- but were also looking at everybody else at the same period.Kaitlan.Q  So why doesnt the order prevent people who didnt have visas by the day of the first order from coming in the country? Because wouldnt that safeguard from the people who went and got visas during this revision period? MR. SPICER: I would just say I think that theres appropriate steps that have been taken during that period to ensure that the homeland has been protected.Go ahead, I know you have another one.Q  Just one more question.MR. SPICER: Of course.Q  Does the President think that Barack Obama himself wiretapped him, or someone in the administration?MR. SPICER: Im just going to say that as the President noted in his statement, were going to let Congress look into that and then well get back to you -- well discuss it after Congress comes with -- Erin.Q  Since the President contends that he and President Obama like each other, has he picked up the phone and called President Obama since the inauguration, or did he think about asking him directly before accusing him publicly?MR. SPICER: I have not -- Im not aware of whether or not theyve talked. I can ask and find out and get back to you.Cecilia.Q  Does the fact that youre rescinding this first executive order -- is it at all an admission that things just didnt go right the first time around?MR. SPICER: No. I think the first executive order, weve made clear time and time again -- when you look at how the court adjudicated that, their facts were wrong. Just in terms of how many people had come into the country, they based it off of several things that I think were not factually accurate. I think we recognized that we could have been in litigation for up to a year on this, and that would have left the country exposed. And I think that thats -- there is a goal here that we sought to achieve the first time that we have to maintain. But by no means -- we 100 percent maintain that the executive order as initially drafted is completely constitutional and legal, and that what weve done is to do the best of our ability based on what the court --Q  Sean --MR. SPICER: Hold on, its still Cecilias turn.Q  Thank you. What about this issue of radicalization after people are here, which is what DHS raised in that report? One of the examples thats cited in the EO today is the Somali man, now, who came as a child and was radicalized here. So what does this order do about that population of people?MR. SPICER: The people that are here --Q  That are here, which is what -- the concern that DHS raised in this report, that said people -- the bigger concern is people who are here and are radicalized after the fact, not those that are here just stopping to --MR. SPICER: I think that what we need to do -- this isnt a one-stop shop. I think that we have to look at this -- the entire problem. This is one piece of the problem that were looking at to make sure that we keep the country safe. Its not a either/or, or only-this-then. But I think youre going to see a continuation of steps that the President takes to make sure that the country is protected.One small correction that Ive been made aware of, its Somalia, not Yemen, that the travel docs are not accepted. So my apologies to Yemen. Jeff, did you -- hold on. Thanks. Jeff.Q  Thank you, Sean. Youve mentioned a couple times and referred a couple times today to DNI Clapper -- former DNI Clappers comments on -- over the weekend about Russia and the Trump campaign. Are you encouraging people to take those comments seriously but not the comments where he said there was no wiretapping?MR. SPICER: No, Im just -- well, first of all, he also said that he wasnt aware -- he couldnt speak entirely when it came to wiretapping. He said that he wasnt aware of anything. I take him at his word that he wasnt aware, but that doesnt mean that it didnt exist.But I also think that its interesting that the double standard that has existed for so long when it comes to -- you have these sources over and over again who have been briefed by the FBI that say, I was briefed, theres nothing there. You have Clapper saying, Not that Im aware of. And yet, we still have these stories over and over again citing anonymous sources.At some point, you have to question how many times are you going to take didnt see anything there before we start seeing these stories getting rewritten over and over and over again? I think that is a valid question. Its interesting how everyone today is asking what sources we have, and yet weve been asking the same question about the sources for these anonymous sources and story after story for the last six months. And its just, dont worry, we have these trusted anonymous sources that may or may not be true. And at the bottom of every story it has some kind of caveat that -- however there has been no formal evidence presented.I think theres been a malignment for so many months about what may or may not have happened, and yet not a shred of single truth has actually come that shows any evidence that existed except for anonymous source after anonymous source after anonymous source.Q  On a different issue? MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q  What is the White Houses reaction to North Korea firing four ballistic missiles into the sea off of Japans northwest?MR. SPICER: The launches are consistent with North Koreas long history of provocative behavior. The United States stands with our allies in the face of this very serious threat. The Trump administration is taking steps to enhance our ability to defend against North Koreas ballistic missiles, such as through the deployment of a THAAD battery to South Africa -- South Korea.Q  I just want to circle back around to a couple things that you said. You said it could be FISA, it could be surveillance. So are you saying that the administration is conceding that somewhere there was evidence presented before a judge that shows there could be collusion with the campaign and that it was okay to surveil them?MR. SPICER: No, what I'm suggesting is that, as I said, that our goal is to allow Congress to do its job, as the statement said yesterday.Olivier.Q  And then the follow-up on the new order. You had said that there are a hundred or so that had been inspected, but how many total that came in that you all have detained.MR. SPICER: Its 300.Q  Of 300 -- 100 refugees? You said hundreds of -- or 300 refugees. How many total came in, and how many did you detain?MR. SPICER: I'd ask you to talk to the Department of Justice -- actually, Homeland Security on that one. I know the top-line stat on that one.Olivier.Q  A couple for you. One, just scheduling. The Israeli defense minister is in town tomorrow. Will he meet with the President?MR. SPICER: I'll have to get back to you on that. I'm not aware that that's on the schedule at this time, but -- I don't know. I know that he and Prime Minister Netanyahu spoke earlier. I'm not aware that that came up.Q  And can you flesh out this notion of 300 refugees being investigated? What are they being investigated for, specifically? Whats the source for this information --MR. SPICER: The FBI.Q  So the FBI is investigating 300 refugees currently on U.S. soil on terrorism-related charges?MR. SPICER: That's what I have been -- yes. I'll get you the stat for that, but that's --Q  That would be great. Thank you.MR. SPICER: Anita.Q  Can you talk a little bit about Iraq and how theyre not -- why theyre not in the executive order anymore? So is this a signal to the other six and to other countries that they can also get removed if they -- I think you called it proactive, if they were proactively having their own actions? MR. SPICER: I think what I would say, and I think the way you phrased it is right. Its not just the six countries, it's countries throughout the globe. I think that we are -- it is in every countrys best interest to know whos coming in and out of its country and to do things. And I think there are things that we've asked countries to do. And it's not inclusive, it's not have you hit these four. I think each country is a separate case. So I don't want to say, if you do these four you're in. Q  But is it possible, then, to --MR. SPICER: Absolutely. I think there is -- now, in some cases, like anything else, Anita, it may be easier for one country to achieve something than for another. But at the end of the day, I think there are certain things that -- there are certain steps that Iraq went through, including things like biometrics and turning over lists of -- updating lists, rather, of people within their country that have -- that pose a threat. And so that -- theyve agreed to do certain things after the first one was ordered that give us a much greater degree of confidence in knowing who is coming in and out of the country.Q  And then on another topic. What was the Presidents reaction to hearing about Vice President Pences email use, personal email for government business? I ask, obviously, because he had so many things to say about Hillary Clinton using personal email for government business last year?MR. SPICER: I was going to insert, like, an AOL joke here. (Laughter.) But I think, look, I dont -- I think theres a big difference. The Vice President complied with Indiana law, turned over all of his emails and made sure that everything was done. I mean, thats a very big step. Theres no question that Ive been made aware of that he didnt do everything in compliance with Indiana law. Theres a big difference between doing what is common practice within a state government and what is in compliance with that states laws, then setting up a private server that seeks specifically to go around the government protocols and the Federal Records Act.Theres a big difference between that. But I mean, the governor at the time, and now the Vice President, did everything in compliance with Indiana law. And I think thats a big difference, is that its not a question of -- its a question of was there a law and was there a rule and did you follow it. In the case of Governor Pence, he did. In the case of Secretary Clinton, I would let the record speak for itself on that.Sara. Gabby, Im sorry.Q  Thanks, Sean. Part of the justification for the hurried rollout of the initial executive order on immigration was that if it wasnt rolled out immediately, that people would take advantage of that and come into the country. So why has the administration decided to delay the implementation of this new executive order until March 16th?MR. SPICER: Im going to refer you Hallie Jackson. (Laughter.) That was what Hallie asked earlier.Q  Sorry.MR. SPICER: No problem, its in the -- but basically the answer that I gave Hallie that Ill give to you is, I think the first order -- one of the goals of the first order was an element of surprise, to implement it in a way that didnt allow people to get in, right?Since the 9th Circuit acted, weve been talking about a second executive order. I think we lost the element of surprise back in mid- to early February when the 9th Circuit acted the way they did. So that element -- what weve tried to do now is to make sure, with that element gone, that weve implemented this in a way that ensures the greatest degree of confidence that we know what were doing.One quick item -- Im not done, so dont -- you can keep your hands -- someone asked earlier, and Im trying to remember who, about the source for DOJ. Was that you, Olivier? The Department of Justice, FBI investigation, section one, subsection H, the text of the EO notes -- you can check on that for the source.Im sorry. Matt.Q  Thanks. Sean, doubling back to something we talked about earlier. President Trump accused President Obama of criminal conduct. One, can you tell us what his source was for that accusation? Two, can you tell us, unequivocally, that he was basing that on more than a talk radio report and a Breitbart article about that talk radio report?MR. SPICER: Im going to tell that -- Ive said it over and over again, I think the President made it very clear in the statement yesterday that he is not going to comment any further on this until Congress does --Q  So maybe it was just based on the talk radio report?MR. SPICER: Im not going to -- Im just going to say that the President made it very clear that, based on numerous things, including -- and I think theres a New York Times story on it, theres several sources that made this clear or brought this to light -- but Im not going to go into anything further, as the President noted, until this is resolved.Mara.Q  I have two topics. One, on the EO that maybe is coming later this week -- an EO on the Obama administrations fuel-economy standards. Are you going to have an EO reversing those, and will that also negate Californias waiver?MR. SPICER: I dont see anything on -- Ill have to get back to you, as my standard. Im not so sure on the timing -- I was just looking at my date. Q  Oh, okay. Thank you. MR. SPICER: But Id just -- I wouldnt get -- I dont have anything to announce at the time, is generally how I answer that, and Im going to stick to it.Q  Okay, but I have just one more question on the other topic. You said that you pointed rightly to Clappers comments -- nothing that he knows of suggests there was any collusion between the campaign and Russia. But he also said that he didnt know of any wiretap FISA order. Why are you willing to accept his --MR. SPICER: Thats what Jeff asked.Q  Well, I guess the thing Im asking is that the President of the United States has unilateral authority to declassify anything that he wants. He said in his tweet, I just learned of this. So he obviously had some kind of evidence. Why not declassify it?MR. SPICER: I think thats -- as I have made clear, theres a reason that we want Congress, the intelligence committees to do their job in terms of making sure that theres a separation of powers. Q  Hes afraid it would look like interference?MR. SPICER: I think that, again, Im just going to leave it at that he thinks its appropriate for Congress to do this instead of trying to point to his own Department of Justice.Ashley.Q  Sean --MR. SPICER: Hold on, youre going to wait your turn. Its Ashleys turn.Q  Thank you. This morning, Kellyanne Conway went on Fox News and she said, Hes the President of the United States. He has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not. So that seemed to be referring not to these news reports youre talking about, but to specific, tangible evidence. So what can you tell us about what that evidence is, where it came from? And then secondly, if he has this evidence, why is he asking Congress to investigate?MR. SPICER: Well, I just -- I think the point that Kellyanne was making at the time is that the President, because hes President, gets access to NSC and other intelligence documents. I dont know -- I havent seen the exact transcript, so I cant --Q  I can read it to you.MR. SPICER: I appreciate that, thank you. But I also havent talked to Kellyanne about it, so I dont think you can do that part. But I dont -- so I cant specifically respond to you in terms of what she was referring to, whether she was referring to the exact nature of his charge or whether, generally speaking, he is given information.But again, on all of this, Im going to go back to the statement earlier that the Presidents goal right now is to make sure that House and Senate can do this -- yes.Q  Thank you, Sean. China is retaliating against the THAAD deployment in South Korea. What is the U.S. position?MR. SPICER: Its retaliating against what?Q  Against the THAAD deployment in South Korea, THAAD battery deployment.MR. SPICER: The THAAD battery?Q  Yes.MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think were going to work with South Korea. I mean, obviously, North Koreas missile launches present a danger to our friends down south. And I think, as I mentioned in our response, were going to continue to work with the government of South Korea to address this thing.Q  Would the U.S. -- the Chinese government?MR. SPICER: Im not at this point -- huh?Q  -- the Chinese government?MR. SPICER: We have not had any further conversations on this. I think this is consistent with U.S. policy. Margaret.Q  Sean, two points of clarification. Did the President mean in any way to suggest that the FBI broke the law, or any other intelligence agencies, with this allegation of wiretapping?MR. SPICER: In the tweet? Q  Yes. MR. SPICER: Im just going to let the tweet speak for itself. Im not going to get into --Q  Well, thats why Im asking this question?MR. SPICER: I get it, but I think that Im not going to try to --Q  Because it opens that up.MR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think I will seek further clarification on that. For right now, I would just suggest to you that Im going to let it speak until I can get further clarification.Q  My second point of clarification here. You said, you know, you didnt want to really get into what the triggering event was for the tweet in the first place, but I want you to address this part if you would. The question has been raised -- or the allegation has been raised that the President was simply trying to change the topic off of an unfortunate news cycle that week. Can you address that portion of the question, that this was deliberately about changing the media narrative and not anything having to do with the story itself?MR. SPICER: No, I dont -- I mean, thats -- I have nothing to lead me to believe that that was the case. Im not sure -- and I think he had a great week last week. He had a phenomenal joint address. We had a great visit down in Norfolk, talked about rebuilding the military. He was in Orlando, in Florida, talking about how school choice can help children and parents and create better schools. So I just -- I cant say that Ive talked to him specifically about this, but I think the President had a good week. And so I dont see any reason that he would be using -- I mean, that just -- I think it was an issue of concern to him.Q  Sean, lets remind everybody what the President did tweet Saturday morning: Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory. He later called Obama a stupid guy -- or whatever it was exactly -- a sick guy. Yeah, sorry. Are the American people supposed to pull back and suddenly think that this is not the President of the United States accusing his predecessor of committing a crime when he writes it that way?MR. SPICER: Look, I think the President speaks very candidly. His tweets speak for themselves, as weve said before, and hes asked the House and Senate committees to look into this.Sara.Q  Considering the scrutiny surrounding President Trumps then-campaign advisors and Russia, which has carried over at the White House, is he reconsidering at all his hope or his timeline for pairing with Russia to fight ISIS?MR. SPICER: Is he -- based on --Q  Just based on the amount of scrutiny surrounding his --MR. SPICER: No, I mean, I think if Russia wants to join with us to fight ISIS, thats a great --Q  So nothing has changed on that front?MR. SPICER: No.Q  And secondly, in light of the fact that there were previously undisclosed communications between the Russian ambassador and Michael Flynn and Jeff Sessions and Jared Kushner, has White House counsel done anything proactively to try to go to senior staffers or other Cabinet-level officials and say, hey, if you have had contact with a Russian official that you have not previously disclosed, then now is the time to do it?MR. SPICER: Not that Im aware of. Im not aware of any of that. I would say that theres -- one of the things that is interesting that, you know -- in the course of people conducting their business here at the White House or during a transition or in the House or the Senate, you contact a whole host of people -- diplomats, government officials, you know, association representatives, corporate representatives. I mean, thats -- those are the kind of folks that talk to people in government. And I think that theres one thing between talking with somebody -- I mean, I think -- and again, Ill get back to you so dont be prescriptive on this. I think someone had told me earlier today that there were something like 20 visits to the Russian ambassador in the last, you know, 10, maybe, years. I dont -- huh? Q  Twenty-two.MR. SPICER: Twenty-two. Thank you for helping fact check me. (Laughter.)Q  -- is not here, so somebodys got to do it. (Laughter.)MR. SPICER: Thank you. Wheres Knoller? But I think at some point, theres nothing wrong with people doing their job, right? I mean, thats what I think that there is a big difference between so-and-so met with someone. Theres nothing to disclose with a meeting. If I have a meeting with a member of the media, no one says, hey, did you know that you need to report every time you meet with this individual or this outlet or whatever. Theres nowhere to report that kind of stuff. Theres a big difference between doing something nefarious or illegal and conducting yourself in a routine course of business.Q  But there were clearly a number of instances where people in this administration suggested they did not have any contact or misled you guys about the amount of contact they had, which has then caused some unflattering news cycles.MR. SPICER: Well, and I think -- so in one case, Michael Flynn was, you know -- the President said the inconsistencies and him not being straight with the Vice President -- he asked him to resign. I think the President dealt with it.But that was -- again, if you note the Presidents comments at the time, he was very clear that the issue wasnt that hes doing his job. The issue was him misleading the Vice President. And that's a very different thing.So he had no problem with him doing his job and contacting individuals that we were going to need to be in contact with during the administration. And that's where I think there is a big difference between a lot of these stories saying, did you know that so and so did this? Theres nothing wrong with people meeting with ambassadors, or government officials, or corporate representatives, or members of the media. That's part of what we do in government. And so I think theres a big difference in the question that you're asking about whether or not someone is doing something that's wrong and inappropriate or illegal, and someone doing what they would do in a normal course of business.Q  Well, I think the other question is just whether there have been more instances in this that are going to catch you guys by surprise since he --MR. SPICER: And I guess --Q  -- the President himself has denied that there was any kind of this contact throughout the campaign, and then we found out there were national security --MR. SPICER: But hold on. Actually --Q  -- advisors you didn't mention meeting with the Russian ambassador as well as Jeff Sessions, and then there was this meeting with Michael Flynn, as well as Jared Kushner, which was not previously disclosed.MR. SPICER: Okay, so theres two things. You said the President found out about this. Whats this? Having a meeting? Again, I don't think that -- theres countless meetings that members of his senior staff and the rest of people throughout government have on it every day. That's why hes asked us to come here and work, is to facilitate some of these meetings and get some of this stuff done.There is no one to disclose stuff to. I don't disclose the --Q  That sounds like you're saying you're not concerned that they're --MR. SPICER: No, its not that Im not concerned. I guess theres -- but what Im getting at, Sara, is that theres a difference between being concerned about somebody -- I could equally be concerned that if a member of the media said, hey, I want to take a member of your staff out, and we're going to break some kind of ethics rule. I would be concerned about that. But I wouldnt be concerned if they said, hey, we want to go have coffee with a member of the media. They don't disclose all that on our staff. And I think -- but that's essential to your question is, is a meeting -- theres nothing wrong with a meeting. Theres nothing wrong with meeting with a government official, or a diplomat, or a member of the media, or a corporate individual, or association, or a constituent, or a citizen that has an issue. But on any of those categories, once they cross the line and do something wrong, and I think to the answer of your question, the issue was specifically -- or the question surrounded attempts to influence the election. Those are very different than people meeting also during a transition period, or people meeting in their White House capacity. But those are three separate instances.All of the stories that Ive heard so far, previously all detailed just action with respect to the campaign and Russias attempt to influence the campaign, right? Q  Yes, I mean, I think --MR. SPICER: Yes, I mean that's --Q  That was the backdrop.MR. SPICER: Right. That's the backdrop. And then -- and so I think in the one instance where it happened where there was someone that misled someone, they were let go. So for you to start asking questions about, well, what if these other individuals had a meeting? Well, were they ever asked about it? I mean theres a big difference between did someone meet with someone; and did someone mislead somebody about meeting someone. And that is a very, very big difference in those questions.And that's one of the things that I think is important to distinguish. People can meet with people. The question is did they do something wrong. Did they mislead somebody? And those are all very, very different categories.April.Q  Okay, Sean, I have a couple of topics. And back on this following up, so the question is: Under what capacity was he in when he met with the ambassador? And what did they talk about?MR. SPICER: Who is he?Q  Sessions.MR. SPICER: I don't know. Q  And then under -- then when he was under oath, he said he didn't do it. But then we find out later, so what do you say --MR. SPICER: No, no. Well, first of all, Im not going to -- Ill refer you back to the Department of Justice. I know -- my understanding is hes amending his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee from what Ive heard. So Ill let his people -- but I do think that his explanation that he gave was very -- was that he was answering a question did you have any meetings with anyone with respect to the campaign.And I think in his mind, it was very clear that, I never met with anybody with respect to the campaign. I met with someone in my Senate office, in my capacity as a United States senator, with Senate staff to discuss foreign policy or whatever it was that he was discussing. I think the Senator discussed this in his media conference last week Thursday. So I don't -- I guess the issue is with respect to what was talked about, I don't know. That's up to him.But I do think the way he described it was very clear that he believed he was answering Senator Frankens question with respect to activity involving the campaign and attempts to -- as I said to Sara, like this whole idea of influencing the election. Meeting with an ambassador about an area of foreign policy in his Senate office with his Senate staff was clearly not a campaign event.Q  Okay, so now on the leak issue. You're talking about Congress doing an investigation. But some of these leaks are coming from top officials, people who know insider information. What has the President said to his staff as it relates to the leaks in reference to trying to find out himself, not just from top-level people, what has he said to people about the leaks, about trying to stop it, or trying to find out whats happening?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the President made clear in his comments when he stood before you all a couple weeks ago that his main concern is national security. That's -- when he keeps talking about the leaks, his concern is the leaks that damage and undermine national security, the leaks that deal with classified and other information. That's what his main concern is. And I don't think -- that's not a White House issue. That's sort of -- that is an issue that is beyond the White House. We're not --Q  Other leaks don't matter, but the national --MR. SPICER: No, no, I think -- its not that other leaks don't matter. I think his issue that he has talked about and his concern is the leaks of national security. Its not that hes saying, other leaks are okay. But I think the ones that threaten our public safety or potentially put our country in harm are the ones that he really cares about. Peter.Q  I have a question. Im sorry. This President reached out to former President Obama several times when he was President.MR. SPICER: That's right.Q  They started building something. There was a bridge. Now some people in the Obama camp are considering these conversations about, or these tweets crazy. And the question is now: With this divide between these two, and President Trump may need to one day reach back to former President Obama, how do you think that will play out? Do you think that these two will never come back together again? Is this something he could have talked to him about before he went on Twitter? There is now a chasm. Theres a divide that wasnt there a couple of weeks ago.MR. SPICER: Okay, well, there was a divide during the campaign, too. I don't think that -- I think that, as you saw, and the President has made it very clear, he said some things about the President. And the President said stuff -- about the campaign. I think they came together for the good of the country. And in cases where they can come together for a common good and to talk about whats in the countrys best interests, they will.But I understand your point. I just think the President --Q  Did he burn a bridge?Q  Hold up, hold on.MR. SPICER: Thank you. But I think that theyll be just fine. So go ahead. That's you.Q  Oh, good.MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Hi, Sean.MR. SPICER: Hi, Julie. You've been very patient.Q  Yes, I have. Thanks.MR. SPICER: I think its your first time.Q  It is, yes.MR. SPICER: Well, welcome. See how pleasant this is?Q  I was feeling like how can I not get called on my first time? Ten years ago, Bob Levinson disappeared in Iran. And I know the President talked about this a little bit on the campaign trail. Is there anything you can tell us about how the administration is approaching this case? Have they been in communication with his family or any updates on that?MR. SPICER: I think we put out a statement from the NSC on Friday on this -- Victoria. I think we -- so we have been in communication with his family. I believe they were here -- or we were in touch with them last week. And obviously, we continue to hold out hope. But the administration has been in touch with his family.Q  Sean, the call to Netanyahu, what prompted that? MR. SPICER: I don't know, Dave. Ill find out. I just know it happened. And I got a little bit of a --Q  As you might know, the Prime Minister is meeting later this week with Vladimir Putin. Did the President and the Prime Minister talk about Syria at all?MR. SPICER: I don't know. I know that they had a discussion about regional threats, so I don't want to get ahead of this.David Jackson.Q  Comey did tell people this weekend that President Obama did not order these wiretaps, and he did want the Justice Department to put out that statement. Does President Obama believe --MR. SPICER: Are you -- like I said, I am not -- wait, so --Q  Does President Trump believe Comey when he says that President Obama did not authorize these wiretaps?MR. SPICER: My question is, is that I don't think that we've confirmed that Director Comey did say that. I don't -- Im not aware. Aside from reading stories that cite anonymous sources saying that he did, Im not aware that that actually happened. So that's the first issue that I think we need to resolve.Q  Well, people we trust did tell us that he did.MR. SPICER: Well, with all due respect, not you, but I think that we've had a number of reports that Ive seen that -- about things that have occurred in the last 40-some-odd days that actually didn't occur, but anonymous sources said they did.Peter Alexander.Q  Sean, to be clear, you said earlier as an on-the-record source for the Presidents wiretapping claims, he referred to the former Attorney General Michael Mukasey. I just want to ask you to clarify if you could because his public comments were on Sunday, a day after the President tweeted about this.  And even in his public comments, he said that he based his information on news reports.MR. SPICER: Okay. But Im just saying that he is -- someone asked whether it was an on-the-record comment. And that is on the record.Q  But I was saying, was there an on -- you were being asked was there an on-the-record comment in advance of the Presidents tweets to which he was basing his information? Did he have anything better than anonymous sources?MR. SPICER: I don't -- Im not -- as I said before, Im not going to get into the elements of that. Ill just -- Im going to wait until the House and Senate.Q  Really, just on a past comment that the President had made about the suggestion that there were -- or the claim, in fact, that there were 3 million to 5 million people who voted illegally in this country -- he made this claim more than a month ago. I just want to get a sense now on the update on any investigation into that and where it stands, given the explosive nature of such a claim.MR. SPICER: I think weve touched on this, but he has asked Vice President Pence to lead a task force on this. We have -- I'll get more for you. I know that theres been some discussion with some Secretaries of State and others on some of this. I know you had that issue in Texas come -- last week, and I'm trying to remember the exact nature of it, but there has been now further evidence that people have voted illegally. And I think that one of the things the task force is looking to do is to gather additional information of what -- it's still in the process of getting the task members named.Q  Does the task force, I guess, exist yet? Or is --MR. SPICER: Yeah, the Vice President has been talking to folks potentially to serve on it, and I know that several Secretaries of State have expressed --Q  It hasn't convened yet, but hes been talking to folks about it.MR. SPICER: That's correct. That's correct.Q  Sean, two subjects here, following up on the wiretap question. Stepping away from what the President knew or the basis of his tweets, how appropriate is it for a President to make an explosive charge as fact and then send you folks out to step away and say this maybe happened and we should investigate it?MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think theres two things. One is the Presidents tweets speak for themselves. We're making that very --Q  But --MR. SPICER: Hold on. And I think the President has been very clear, as we've stated, that I think theres enough there that we want the House and Senate intelligence to use the resources they do to make sure that they look into this matter. I mean, that's -- there is -- anyway, I do not want to get ahead of where they may go with this or what they may look at, but I'm going to leave it to them. If we start down the rabbit hole of discussing some of this stuff I think then we end up in a very difficult place.I look forward to seeing you guys tomorrow. If you can bring your cameras --Q  Sean, housekeeping-wise, you said that wed get some clarification on a number of questions -- to all of us. If you could do that today through the pool --MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think we can try to do that through the pool. If not, we'll write everything -- we generally write down everything and try to get back to the reporters. So I will have the team -- and then get it out by the pool.Q  Will we be hearing from the President this week, since we didnt today?MR. SPICER: I'm sure at some point we'll do either something that we -- a photo spray or something. I think that we have a pretty good track record of making the President available to folks. Q  -- kind of unusual.MR. SPICER: Whats unusual? Q  To not --MR. SPICER: It's Monday.Q  Exactly.Q  But you see -- everything is closed. Normally we have a photo spray or something.MR. SPICER: I just -- I think that's -- don't give me this normally we do. I made it very clear at the beginning of this, April, that we have some things on camera, some off. Last week the President traveled two days, he had the joint session. We briefed every single day --Q  Its not about us, its about the American public seeing their President. And we have to --MR. SPICER: Wait, hold on. Seeing their President. The guy is in meetings all day. I'm trying -- how many times did you complain about the President --Q  He signed executive orders. You had us -- last week you said --MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. He signed an executive order. I mean, this is a President, when it comes to accessibility and allowing the press access, I think I've heard from several of you -- we have gone above and beyond allowing the press into events, into sprays. We've had greater access. So, with all due respect, I mean that's not been the case. One day out of the last 41 or 40, whatever it's been -- but I think this President has been extremely accessible, extremely transparent, as far as -- he signed an executive order this morning that we then put all three Cabinet Secretaries that were relevant to implement this out.I'll be out tomorrow. I think we have an opportunity -- look, I made it very clear from the beginning of this that wed have a briefing every day. We've gaggled every day, we've made ourselves available to you. So, with all due respect, that's not a very accurate assessment of how we've been acting.Thanks. I'll see you guys tomorrow.END 2:50 P.M.

Trump Proclaims March 5 through March 11, 2017, as National Consumer Protection Week","NATIONAL CONSUMER PROTECTION WEEK, 2017- - - - - - -BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATIONThe economic strength and vitality of our Nation is directly linked to our consumers' confidence in the integrity and security of their personal information and the robust protection of their privacy. As an increasing number of transactions and activities occur online, the safety of vital consumer information is increasingly at risk. The American people deserve freedom from unscrupulous actors who perpetrate identity theft, abuse personal information, or engage in fraud.Cyber crimes, which defraud hard-working Americans, cost our families billions of dollars each year and result in tremendous stress, loss of time, and hardship. Americans must have access to the tools necessary to protect their personal information and privacy and know how to use them to improve their online security. Our first defense against fraudulent cyber transactions and the misuse of personal information will always be a well-informed consumer. National Consumer Protection Week reminds us of the importance of empowering consumers by helping them to more capably identify and report cyber scams, monitor their online privacy and security, and make well-informed decisions. The Federal Government, in conjunction with a network of national organizations and State and local partners, provides consumer education resources to help Americans protect their personal information. These resources assist military service members and their families, identity-theft victims, and all potentially vulnerable consumers. Our work to protect consumers from identity theft, abuse of personal information, and fraud, and to improve the integrity and security of our marketplaces, enhances the prosperity of our great country.NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 5 through March 11, 2017, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon government officials, industry leaders, and advocates to educate our citizens about the protection of personal information and identity theft through consumer education activities in communities across the country.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.DONALD J.

272,2017-03-06,President Trump Congratulates Exxon Mobil for Job-Creating Investment Program,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- President Donald J. Trump today congratulated Exxon Mobil Corporation on its ambitious $20 billion investment program that is creating more than 45,000 construction and manufacturing jobs in the United States Gulf Coast region.President Trump made a promise to bring back jobs to America. The spirit of optimism sweeping the country is already boosting job growth, and it is only the beginning.This is exactly the kind of investment, economic development and job creation that will help put Americans back to work, the President said. Many of the products that will be manufactured here in the United States by American workers will be exported to other countries, improving our balance of trade. This is a true American success story. In addition, the jobs created are paying on average $100,000 per year.Darren W. Woods, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil announced the companys investment program during a keynote speech today to an oil and gas industry conference in Houston, Texas.Investments of this scale require a pro-growth approach and a stable regulatory environment and we appreciate the Presidents commitment to both, said Woods. The energy industry has proven it can operate safely and responsibly. Private sector investment is enhanced by this Administrations support for smart regulations that support growth while protecting the environment.Exxon Mobil is strategically investing in new refining and chemical-manufacturing projects in the United States Gulf Coast region to expand its manufacturing and export capacity. The companys Growing the Gulf program consists of 11 major chemical, refining, lubricant and liquefied natural gas projects at proposed new and existing facilities along the Texas and Louisiana coasts. Investments began in 2013 and are expected to continue through at least 2022.Exxon Mobils projects, once completed and operating at mature levels, are expected to have far-reaching and long-lasting benefits. Projects planned or under way are expected to create more than 35,000 construction jobs and more than 12,000 full-time jobs. These are full-time manufacturing jobs that are mostly high-skilled and high-paying, and have annual salaries ranging from $75,000 to $125,000.

273,2017-03-06,Executive Order Protecting The Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into The United States,"EXECUTIVE ORDER- - - - - - -PROTECTING THE NATION FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATESBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and to protect the Nation from terrorist activities by foreign nationals admitted to the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1. Policy and Purpose. (a) It is the policy of the United States to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. The screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) play a crucial role in detecting foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism and in preventing those individuals from entering the United States. It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP.(b) On January 27, 2017, to implement this policy, I issued Executive Order 13769 (Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States).(i)  Among other actions, Executive Order 13769 suspended for 90 days the entry of certain aliens from seven countries: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. These are countries that had already been identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States. Specifically, the suspension applied to countries referred to in, or designated under, section 217(a)(12) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12), in which Congress restricted use of the Visa Waiver Program for nationals of, and aliens recently present in, (A) Iraq or Syria, (B) any country designated by the Secretary of State as a state sponsor of terrorism (currently Iran, Syria, and Sudan), and (C) any other country designated as a country of concern by the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence. In 2016, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as additional countries of concern for travel purposes, based on consideration of three statutory factors related to terrorism and national security: ""(I) whether the presence of an alien in the country or area increases the likelihood that the alien is a credible threat to the national security of the United States; (II) whether a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country or area; and (III) whether the country or area is a safe haven for terrorists."" 8 U.S.C. 1187(a)(12)(D)(ii). Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.(ii)  In ordering the temporary suspension of entry described in subsection (b)(i) of this section, I exercised my authority under Article II of the Constitution and under section 212(f) of the INA, which provides in relevant part: ""Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."" 8 U.S.C. 1182(f). Under these authorities, I determined that, for a brief period of 90 days, while existing screening and vetting procedures were under review, the entry into the United States of certain aliens from the seven identified countries -- each afflicted by terrorism in a manner that compromised the ability of the United States to rely on normal decision-making procedures about travel to the United States -- would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.(iii) Executive Order 13769 also suspended the USRAP for 120 days. Terrorist groups have sought to infiltrate several nations through refugee programs. Accordingly, I temporarily suspended the USRAP pending a review of our procedures for screening and vetting refugees. Nonetheless, I permitted the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security to jointly grant case-by-case waivers when they determined that it was in the national interest to do so.(iv)  Executive Order 13769 did not provide a basis for discriminating for or against members of any particular religion. While that order allowed for prioritization of refugee claims from members of persecuted religious minority groups, that priority applied to refugees from every nation, including those in which Islam is a minority religion, and it applied to minority sects within a religion. That order was not motivated by animus toward any religion, but was instead intended to protect the ability of religious minorities -- whoever they are and wherever they reside -- to avail themselves of the USRAP in light of their particular challenges and circumstances.(c) The implementation of Executive Order 13769 has been delayed by litigation. Most significantly, enforcement of critical provisions of that order has been temporarily halted by court orders that apply nationwide and extend even to foreign nationals with no prior or substantial connection to the United States. On February 9, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit declined to stay or narrow one such order pending the outcome of further judicial proceedings, while noting that the ""political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions"" about who should be covered by a suspension of entry or of refugee admissions.(d) Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats. Each of these countries is a state sponsor of terrorism, has been significantly compromised by terrorist organizations, or contains active conflict zones. Any of these circumstances diminishes the foreign government's willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States. Moreover, the significant presence in each of these countries of terrorist organizations, their members, and others exposed to those organizations increases the chance that conditions will be exploited to enable terrorist operatives or sympathizers to travel to the United States. Finally, once foreign nationals from these countries are admitted to the United States, it is often difficult to remove them, because many of these countries typically delay issuing, or refuse to issue, travel documents.(e) The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:(i)  Iran. Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984 and continues to support various terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, and terrorist groups in Iraq. Iran has also been linked to support for al-Qa'ida and has permitted al-Qa'ida to transport funds and fighters through Iran to Syria and South Asia. Iran does not cooperate with the United States in counterterrorism efforts.(ii)  Libya. Libya is an active combat zone, with hostilities between the internationally recognized government and its rivals. In many parts of the country, security and law enforcement functions are provided by armed militias rather than state institutions. Violent extremist groups, including the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), have exploited these conditions to expand their presence in the country. The Libyan government provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, but it is unable to secure thousands of miles of its land and maritime borders, enabling the illicit flow of weapons, migrants, and foreign terrorist fighters. The United States Embassy in Libya suspended its operations in 2014.(iii) Somalia. Portions of Somalia have been terrorist safe havens. Al-Shabaab, an al-Qa'ida-affiliated terrorist group, has operated in the country for years and continues to plan and mount operations within Somalia and in neighboring countries. Somalia has porous borders, and most countries do not recognize Somali identity documents. The Somali government cooperates with the United States in some counterterrorism operations but does not have the capacity to sustain military pressure on or to investigate suspected terrorists.(iv)  Sudan. Sudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1993 because of its support for international terrorist groups, including Hizballah and Hamas. Historically, Sudan provided safe havens for al-Qa'ida and other terrorist groups to meet and train. Although Sudan's support to al-Qa'ida has ceased and it provides some cooperation with the United States' counterterrorism efforts, elements of core al-Qa'ida and ISIS-linked terrorist groups remain active in the country.(v)  Syria. Syria has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The Syrian government is engaged in an ongoing military conflict against ISIS and others for control of portions of the country. At the same time, Syria continues to support other terrorist groups. It has allowed or encouraged extremists to pass through its territory to enter Iraq. ISIS continues to attract foreign fighters to Syria and to use its base in Syria to plot or encourage attacks around the globe, including in the United States. The United States Embassy in Syria suspended its operations in 2012. Syria does not cooperate with the United States' counterterrorism efforts.(vi)  Yemen. Yemen is the site of an ongoing conflict between the incumbent government and the Houthi-led opposition. Both ISIS and a second group, al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), have exploited this conflict to expand their presence in Yemen and to carry out hundreds of attacks. Weapons and other materials smuggled across Yemen's porous borders are used to finance AQAP and other terrorist activities. In 2015, the United States Embassy in Yemen suspended its operations, and embassy staff were relocated out of the country. Yemen has been supportive of, but has not been able to cooperate fully with, the United States in counterterrorism efforts.(f) In light of the conditions in these six countries, until the assessment of current screening and vetting procedures required by section 2 of this order is completed, the risk of erroneously permitting entry of a national of one of these countries who intends to commit terrorist acts or otherwise harm the national security of the United States is unacceptably high. Accordingly, while that assessment is ongoing, I am imposing a temporary pause on the entry of nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, subject to categorical exceptions and case-by-case waivers, as described in section 3 of this order.(g) Iraq presents a special case. Portions of Iraq remain active combat zones. Since 2014, ISIS has had dominant influence over significant territory in northern and central Iraq. Although that influence has been significantly reduced due to the efforts and sacrifices of the Iraqi government and armed forces, working along with a United States-led coalition, the ongoing conflict has impacted the Iraqi government's capacity to secure its borders and to identify fraudulent travel documents. Nevertheless, the close cooperative relationship between the United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and Iraq's commitment to combat ISIS justify different treatment for Iraq. In particular, those Iraqi government forces that have fought to regain more than half of the territory previously dominated by ISIS have shown steadfast determination and earned enduring respect as they battle an armed group that is the common enemy of Iraq and the United States. In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject to final orders of removal. Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.(h) Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security. Since 2001, hundreds of persons born abroad have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes in the United States. They have included not just persons who came here legally on visas but also individuals who first entered the country as refugees. For example, in January 2013, two Iraqi nationals admitted to the United States as refugees in 2009 were sentenced to 40 years and to life in prison, respectively, for multiple terrorism-related offenses. And in October 2014, a native of Somalia who had been brought to the United States as a child refugee and later became a naturalized United States citizen was sentenced to 30 years in prison for attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction as part of a plot to detonate a bomb at a crowded Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon. The Attorney General has reported to me that more than 300 persons who entered the United States as refugees are currently the subjects of counterterrorism investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.(i) Given the foregoing, the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may commit, aid, or support acts of terrorism remains a matter of grave concern. In light of the Ninth Circuit's observation that the political branches are better suited to determine the appropriate scope of any suspensions than are the courts, and in order to avoid spending additional time pursuing litigation, I am revoking Executive Order 13769 and replacing it with this order, which expressly excludes from the suspensions categories of aliens that have prompted judicial concerns and which clarifies or refines the approach to certain other issues or categories of affected aliens.Sec. 2. Temporary Suspension of Entry for Nationals of Countries of Particular Concern During Review Period. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall conduct a worldwide review to identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat. The Secretary of Homeland Security may conclude that certain information is needed from particular countries even if it is not needed from every country.(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President a report on the results of the worldwide review described in subsection (a) of this section, including the Secretary of Homeland Security's determination of the information needed from each country for adjudications and a list of countries that do not provide adequate information, within 20 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall provide a copy of the report to the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence.(c) To temporarily reduce investigative burdens on relevant agencies during the review period described in subsection (a) of this section, to ensure the proper review and maximum utilization of available resources for the screening and vetting of foreign nationals, to ensure that adequate standards are established to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists, and in light of the national security concerns referenced in section 1 of this order, I hereby proclaim, pursuant to sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) and 1185(a), that the unrestricted entry into the United States of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. I therefore direct that the entry into the United States of nationals of those six countries be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of this order, subject to the limitations, waivers, and exceptions set forth in sections 3 and 12 of this order.(d) Upon submission of the report described in subsection (b) of this section regarding the information needed from each country for adjudications, the Secretary of State shall request that all foreign governments that do not supply such information regarding their nationals begin providing it within 50 days of notification.(e) After the period described in subsection (d) of this section expires, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, shall submit to the President a list of countries recommended for inclusion in a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of appropriate categories of foreign nationals of countries that have not provided the information requested until they do so or until the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies that the country has an adequate plan to do so, or has adequately shared information through other means. The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security may also submit to the President the names of additional countries for which any of them recommends other lawful restrictions or limitations deemed necessary for the security or welfare of the United States.(f) At any point after the submission of the list described in subsection (e) of this section, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, may submit to the President the names of any additional countries recommended for similar treatment, as well as the names of any countries that they recommend should be removed from the scope of a proclamation described in subsection (e) of this section.(g) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President a joint report on the progress in implementing this order within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 90 days of the effective date of this order, a third report within 120 days of the effective date of this order, and a fourth report within 150 days of the effective date of this order.Sec. 3. Scope and Implementation of Suspension. (a) Scope. Subject to the exceptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section and any waiver under subsection (c) of this section, the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall apply only to foreign nationals of the designated countries who:(i)  are outside the United States on the effective date of this order;(ii)  did not have a valid visa at 5:00 p.m., eastern standard time on January 27, 2017; and(iii) do not have a valid visa on the effective date of this order.(b) Exceptions. The suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order shall not apply to:(i)  any lawful permanent resident of the United States;(ii)  any foreign national who is admitted to or paroled into the United States on or after the effective date of this order;(iii) any foreign national who has a document other than a visa, valid on the effective date of this order or issued on any date thereafter, that permits him or her to travel to the United States and seek entry or admission, such as an advance parole document;(iv)  any dual national of a country designated under section 2 of this order when the individual is traveling on a passport issued by a non-designated country;(v)  any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; or(vi)  any foreign national who has been granted asylum; any refugee who has already been admitted to the United States; or any individual who has been granted withholding of removal, advance parole, or protection under the Convention Against Torture.(c) Waivers. Notwithstanding the suspension of entry pursuant to section 2 of this order, a consular officer, or, as appropriate, the Commissioner, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), or the Commissioner's delegee, may, in the consular officer's or the CBP official's discretion, decide on a case-by-case basis to authorize the issuance of a visa to, or to permit the entry of, a foreign national for whom entry is otherwise suspended if the foreign national has demonstrated to the officer's satisfaction that denying entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to national security and would be in the national interest. Unless otherwise specified by the Secretary of Homeland Security, any waiver issued by a consular officer as part of the visa issuance process will be effective both for the issuance of a visa and any subsequent entry on that visa, but will leave all other requirements for admission or entry unchanged. Case-by-case waivers could be appropriate in circumstances such as the following:(i)  the foreign national has previously been admitted to the United States for a continuous period of work, study, or other long-term activity, is outside the United States on the effective date of this order, seeks to reenter the United States to resume that activity, and the denial of reentry during the suspension period would impair that activity;(ii)  the foreign national has previously established significant contacts with the United States but is outside the United States on the effective date of this order for work, study, or other lawful activity;(iii)  the foreign national seeks to enter the United States for significant business or professional obligations and the denial of entry during the suspension period would impair those obligations;(iv)  the foreign national seeks to enter the United States to visit or reside with a close family member (e.g., a spouse, child, or parent) who is a United States citizen, lawful permanent resident, or alien lawfully admitted on a valid nonimmigrant visa, and the denial of entry during the suspension period would cause undue hardship;(v)the foreign national is an infant, a young child or adoptee, an individual needing urgent medical care, or someone whose entry is otherwise justified by the special circumstances of the case;(vi)  the foreign national has been employed by, or on behalf of, the United States Government (or is an eligible dependent of such an employee) and the employee can document that he or she has provided faithful and valuable service to the United States Government;(vii)  the foreign national is traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the International Organizations Immunities Act (IOIA), 22 U.S.C. 288 et seq., traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government, or traveling to conduct business on behalf of an international organization not designated under the IOIA;(viii) the foreign national is a landed Canadian immigrant who applies for a visa at a location within Canada; or(ix)  the foreign national is traveling as a United States Government-sponsored exchange visitor.Sec. 4. Additional Inquiries Related to Nationals of Iraq. An application by any Iraqi national for a visa, admission, or other immigration benefit should be subjected to thorough review, including, as appropriate, consultation with a designee of the Secretary of Defense and use of the additional information that has been obtained in the context of the close U.S.-Iraqi security partnership, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, concerning individuals suspected of ties to ISIS or other terrorist organizations and individuals coming from territories controlled or formerly controlled by ISIS. Such review shall include consideration of whether the applicant has connections with ISIS or other terrorist organizations or with territory that is or has been under the dominant influence of ISIS, as well as any other information bearing on whether the applicant may be a threat to commit acts of terrorism or otherwise threaten the national security or public safety of the United States.Sec. 5. Implementing Uniform Screening and Vetting Standards for All Immigration Programs. (a) The Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence shall implement a program, as part of the process for adjudications, to identify individuals who seek to enter the United States on a fraudulent basis, who support terrorism, violent extremism, acts of violence toward any group or class of people within the United States, or who present a risk of causing harm subsequent to their entry. This program shall include the development of a uniform baseline for screening and vetting standards and procedures, such as in-person interviews; a database of identity documents proffered by applicants to ensure that duplicate documents are not used by multiple applicants; amended application forms that include questions aimed at identifying fraudulent answers and malicious intent; a mechanism to ensure that applicants are who they claim to be; a mechanism to assess whether applicants may commit, aid, or support any kind of violent, criminal, or terrorist acts after entering the United States; and any other appropriate means for ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary for a rigorous evaluation of all grounds of inadmissibility or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall submit to the President an initial report on the progress of the program described in subsection (a) of this section within 60 days of the effective date of this order, a second report within 100 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report within 200 days of the effective date of this order.Sec. 6. Realignment of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for Fiscal Year 2017. (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall suspend decisions on applications for refugee status, for 120 days after the effective date of this order, subject to waivers pursuant to subsection (c) of this section. During the 120-day period, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, shall review the USRAP application and adjudication processes to determine what additional procedures should be used to ensure that individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a threat to the security and welfare of the United States, and shall implement such additional procedures. The suspension described in this subsection shall not apply to refugee applicants who, before the effective date of this order, have been formally scheduled for transit by the Department of State. The Secretary of State shall resume travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP 120 days after the effective date of this order, and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall resume making decisions on applications for refugee status only for stateless persons and nationals of countries for which the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence have jointly determined that the additional procedures implemented pursuant to this subsection are adequate to ensure the security and welfare of the United States.(b) Pursuant to section 212(f) of the INA, I hereby proclaim that the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, and thus suspend any entries in excess of that number until such time as I determine that additional entries would be in the national interest.(c) Notwithstanding the temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security may jointly determine to admit individuals to the United States as refugees on a case-by-case basis, in their discretion, but only so long as they determine that the entry of such individuals as refugees is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States, including in circumstances such as the following: the individual's entry would enable the United States to conform its conduct to a preexisting international agreement or arrangement, or the denial of entry would cause undue hardship.(d) It is the policy of the executive branch that, to the extent permitted by law and as practicable, State and local jurisdictions be granted a role in the process of determining the placement or settlement in their jurisdictions of aliens eligible to be admitted to the United States as refugees. To that end, the Secretary of State shall examine existing law to determine the extent to which, consistent with applicable law, State and local jurisdictions may have greater involvement in the process of determining the placement or resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions, and shall devise a proposal to lawfully promote such involvement.Sec. 7. Rescission of Exercise of Authority Relating to the Terrorism Grounds of Inadmissibility. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall, in consultation with the Attorney General, consider rescinding the exercises of authority permitted by section 212(d)(3)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1182(d)(3)(B), relating to the terrorism grounds of inadmissibility, as well as any related implementing directives or guidance.Sec. 8. Expedited Completion of the Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System. (a) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall expedite the completion and implementation of a biometric entry exit tracking system for in-scope travelers to the United States, as recommended by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States.(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit to the President periodic reports on the progress of the directive set forth in subsection (a) of this section. The initial report shall be submitted within 100 days of the effective date of this order, a second report shall be submitted within 200 days of the effective date of this order, and a third report shall be submitted within 365 days of the effective date of this order. The Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit further reports every 180 days thereafter until the system is fully deployed and operational.Sec. 9. Visa Interview Security. (a) The Secretary of State shall immediately suspend the Visa Interview Waiver Program and ensure compliance with section 222 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1202, which requires that all individuals seeking a nonimmigrant visa undergo an in-person interview, subject to specific statutory exceptions. This suspension shall not apply to any foreign national traveling on a diplomatic or diplomatic-type visa, North Atlantic Treaty Organization visa, C-2 visa for travel to the United Nations, or G-1, G-2, G-3, or G-4 visa; traveling for purposes related to an international organization designated under the IOIA; or traveling for purposes of conducting meetings or business with the United States Government.(b) To the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of State shall immediately expand the Consular Fellows Program, including by substantially increasing the number of Fellows, lengthening or making permanent the period of service, and making language training at the Foreign Service Institute available to Fellows for assignment to posts outside of their area of core linguistic ability, to ensure that nonimmigrant visa-interview wait times are not unduly affected.Sec. 10. Visa Validity Reciprocity. The Secretary of State shall review all nonimmigrant visa reciprocity agreements and arrangements to ensure that they are, with respect to each visa classification, truly reciprocal insofar as practicable with respect to validity period and fees, as required by sections 221(c) and 281 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1201(c) and 1351, and other treatment. If another country does not treat United States nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas in a truly reciprocal manner, the Secretary of State shall adjust the visa validity period, fee schedule, or other treatment to match the treatment of United States nationals by that foreign country, to the extent practicable.Sec. 11. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To be more transparent with the American people and to implement more effectively policies and practices that serve the national interest, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, collect and make publicly available the following information:(i)  information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been charged with terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; convicted of terrorism-related offenses while in the United States; or removed from the United States based on terrorism-related activity, affiliation with or provision of material support to a terrorism-related organization, or any other national-security-related reasons;(ii)  information regarding the number of foreign nationals in the United States who have been radicalized after entry into the United States and who have engaged in terrorism-related acts, or who have provided material support to terrorism-related organizations in countries that pose a threat to the United States;(iii) information regarding the number and types of acts of gender-based violence against women, including so-called ""honor killings,"" in the United States by foreign nationals; and(iv)  any other information relevant to public safety and security as determined by the Secretary of Homeland Security or the Attorney General, including information on the immigration status of foreign nationals charged with major offenses.(b) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall release the initial report under subsection (a) of this section within 180 days of the effective date of this order and shall include information for the period from September 11, 2001, until the date of the initial report. Subsequent reports shall be issued every 180 days thereafter and reflect the period since the previous report.Sec. 12. Enforcement. (a) The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall consult with appropriate domestic and international partners, including countries and organizations, to ensure efficient, effective, and appropriate implementation of the actions directed in this order.(b) In implementing this order, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including, as appropriate, those providing an opportunity for individuals to claim a fear of persecution or torture, such as the credible fear determination for aliens covered by section 235(b)(1)(A) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. 1225(b)(1)(A).(c) No immigrant or nonimmigrant visa issued before the effective date of this order shall be revoked pursuant to this order. (d) Any individual whose visa was marked revoked or marked canceled as a result of Executive Order 13769 shall be entitled to a travel document confirming that the individual is permitted to travel to the United States and seek entry. Any prior cancellation or revocation of a visa that was solely pursuant to Executive Order 13769 shall not be the basis of inadmissibility for any future determination about entry or admissibility.(e) This order shall not apply to an individual who has been granted asylum, to a refugee who has already been admitted to the United States, or to an individual granted withholding of removal or protection under the Convention Against Torture. Nothing in this order shall be construed to limit the ability of an individual to seek asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the Convention Against Torture, consistent with the laws of the United States.Sec. 13. Revocation. Executive Order 13769 of January 27, 2017, is revoked as of the effective date of this order.Sec. 14. Effective Date. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m., eastern daylight time on March 16, 2017.Sec. 15. Severability. (a) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.(b) If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid because of the lack of certain procedural requirements, the relevant executive branch officials shall implement those procedural requirements.Sec. 16. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)  the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.DONALD J.

274,2017-03-06,Memorandum: Spring 2017 Data Call for the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions,"MEMORANDUM FOR: REGULATORY POLICY OFFICERS AT EXECUTIVE                     DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AND MANAGING                     AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS OF CERTAIN AGENCIES AND COMMISSIONSFROM: Dominic J. Mancini, Acting Administrator       Office of Information and Regulatory AffairsSUBJECT: Spring 2017 Data Call for the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions This memorandum and its attachment contain guidelines and procedures for publishing the Spring 2017 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) (see Attachment, infra). Publication of the Unified Agenda represents a key component of the regulatory planning mechanism prescribed in Executive Order (EO) 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735 (Sept. 30, 1993), and reaffirmed in EO 13563, Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review, 76 FR 3821 (Jan. 18, 2011).The complete Unified Agenda will be available online at www.reginfo.gov. We plan to continue our practice of publishing in the Federal Register only the Unified Agenda information required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.  601 et seq.). For further information about publication format, please refer to the attached guidelines and procedures.As you design your submissions (which are due by March 31, 2017) we ask that you give especially careful attention to the principles and requirements identified in EO 13771, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, 82 FR 9339 (Jan. 30, 2017); EO 13659, ""Streamlining the Export/Import Process for Americas Businesses,"" 79 FR 10657 (Feb. 19, 2014); EO 13563; EO 13610, Identifying and Reducing Regulatory Burdens, 77 FR 28469 (May 10, 2012); and EO 13609, Promoting International Regulatory Cooperation, 77 FR 26413 (May 1, 2012).In particular, EO 13771 recognizes it is the policy of the executive branch to be prudent and financially responsible in the expenditure of funds, and that it is essential to manage the costs associated with the governmental imposition of private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations. Consistent with these principles, and with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRAs) February 2, 2017 memorandum entitled, Interim Guidance Implementing Section 2 of the EO of January 30, 2017, Titled Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, (and any successor memos), your submissions should reflect attention to the following requirements:The total incremental costs of any new significant regulatory actions issued between noon on January 20, 2017 and September 30, 2017 shall, to the extent permitted by law, be fully offset as of September 30, 2017; andAgencies should, for each new significant regulatory action that imposes costs and that an agency plans to issue on or before September 30, 2017, identify two existing regulatory actions the agency plans to eliminate or propose for elimination on or before September 30, 2017.In addition, we recognize that Unified Agenda submissions will likely include regulatory actions that you plan to issue in Fiscal Year 2018. Section 3 of EO 13771 states that Beginning with the Regulatory Plans (required under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993, as amended, or any successor order) for fiscal year 2018, and for each fiscal year thereafter, the head of each agency shall identify, for each regulation that increases incremental cost, the offsetting regulations described in section 2(c) of this order, and provide the agency's best approximation of the total costs or savings associated with each new regulation or repealed regulation. While OIRA recognizes that EO 13771 refers to The Regulatory Plan traditionally issued in the fall, in order to facilitate the fiscal year 2018 regulatory budget planning process we are requesting that your spring 2017 submissions include a preliminary estimate of the total costs or savings associated with each of your planned fiscal year 2018 significant regulatory actions and offsetting deregulatory actions. Such cost estimates should be consistent with OMB Circular A-4, Regulatory Analysis, (Sept. 17, 2003). Some of these regulatory and deregulatory actions may fall out of the 12 month reporting window for this Unified Agenda cycle: if that is that case, we nevertheless request that the agencies base this cost estimate on your best current prediction of the planned fiscal year 2018 actions. We understand that these preliminary estimates are subject to discussion and revision during the rulemaking, review, and regulatory budgeting processes. We remind agencies of EO 13771s directives that for every one new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations be identified for elimination, and that the cost of planned regulations be prudently managed and controlled through a budgeting process.Also, the process for designating significant regulatory actions set forth in EO 12866 has not changed and we ask that you consult with your agencys OIRA desk officer on significance determinations for planned regulatory actions. Finally, please ensure that a department or agency head appointed or designated by the President after noon on January 20, 2017, or his or her delegate, has had an opportunity to review significant regulatory actions in light of these directives.Please note that the immediately preceding requirements apply only to those agencies required to submit significant regulatory actions to OIRA for review under EO 12866, and are subject to any additional exceptions identified in EO 13771, by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, or in any implementing guidance issued by OIRA. Nevertheless, we encourage independent regulatory agencies to identify existing regulations that, if repealed or revised, would achieve cost savings that would fully offset the costs of new significant regulatory actions.Preparing and Transmitting Agency Unified Agenda Submissions: The Attachment to this memorandum identifies the materials you will need and explains in detail how to prepare your agencys submission for the Unified Agenda (whether you enter the information directly into the database, transmit a complete electronic file, or submit the information on paper forms). Please follow the procedures explained in the Attachment carefully and be sure to include all required documents with your submission.Your agency may direct any questions regarding the content of its Unified Agenda submission to the appropriate desk officer in the OIRA.It is very important that your agency submits all Unified Agenda materials by March 31, 2017. Please direct your submissions and production questions, as well as requests for additional materials, to the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC), General Services Administration, 1800 F Street NW., Room 2219F, Washington, DC 20405-0001, telephone (202) 482-7340.Ways for an Agency to Make Its Unified Agenda Submission More Open and Informative to the Public: As you prepare your Unified Agenda submission, please keep in mind that agencies can help achieve the objectives of open government by making clear, meaningful, and informative contributions to the Unified Agenda. By supplying accurate, timely content, you will increase the transparency and accessibility of the regulatory process, maximizing the value of these documents to the public, while also improving planning and coordination.The Unified Agenda offers optional data elements for the URLs of websites with more information about a rulemaking and for submitting public comments. To help promote accessibility, we encourage you to provide relevant URLs whenever available. In addition, please include in your preamble a reference to www.regulations.gov, the government-wide website for submission of comments on proposed regulations.The following are suggested steps you can take to improve your agencys Unified Agenda:In recent years, a large number of Unified Agenda entries have reflected regulatory actions for which no substantial activity was expected within the coming year. Many of these entries are listed as Long-Term. We have retained the ability to list these items in the Agenda, and see merit in their continued inclusion, particularly in some instances of notable rulemakings for which no action is planned in the coming year. Please, however, consider whether the listing of such entries still benefits readers.Many entries are listed with projected dates that have simply been moved forward year after year, with no action taken. Unless you realistically intend and have the resources to take action over the next 12 months, please consider removing these items from the Unified Agenda.Please review any Unified Agenda entries marked Routine and Frequent or Informational/Administrative/Other and consider whether these entries (1) are categorized correctly and (2) meet the criteria for inclusion in the Unified Agenda under EO 12866.The timetables that appear for each entry in the Unified Agenda are particularly important for public understanding of the timeframes for participation in the regulatory process. Please take all reasonable steps to ensure the accuracy of timetable information.An overall effort to maintain the quality of agency Unified Agenda content necessarily includes an emphasis on consistency of agency data. As one example of coordinating related information, please make sure that responses for Priority, Major, Unfunded Mandates, Federalism, and Government Levels Affected are consistent within an agency.Abstracts should inform readers of the reason the rulemaking is under development and what the agency intends to accomplish. Entries with outdated information, or abstracts that merely repeat content appearing elsewhere in the entrysuch as the title, timetable, or legal authoritydetract from the usefulness of the Unified Agenda, and should be avoided.Thank you for your cooperation and prompt attention. All submissions are due by March 31, 2017. AttachmentGuidelines and Procedures for the Spring 2017 Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions Why Is the Unified Agenda Published? All executive departments and establishments subject to Executive Order (EO) 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735 (Sept. 30, 1993), are required by section 4(b) to publish a regulatory agenda. The Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) is a compilation of each entitys regulatory agenda (agency agenda). In addition, the Unified Agenda furthers the purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.  601 et seq.) (RFA); EO 13771, Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs, 82 FR 9339 (Jan. 30, 2017); EO 13132, Federalism, 64 FR 43255 (Aug. 4, 1999); the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C.  150104, 153138, 155156 (UMRA); and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, 5 U.S.C.  601 note. A central goal of the Unified Agenda is to promote transparency and open government. In the Fall edition, the Unified Agenda also includes The Regulatory Plan, describing the most important significant regulatory and deregulatory actions that the agency reasonably expects to issue in proposed or final form during the upcoming year.What Regulations Should Agencies Include in Their Agendas? Regulatory agendas should describe all regulations under development or review during the 12 months following publication. Agencies should include, at a minimum, any plans to publish or otherwise implement an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM), a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), or a Final Rule. Agencies may include any plans to conduct a review pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  610(c) or section 5 of EO 12866. An agency need not include in its regulatory agenda those rulemaking actions that are excluded by section 3(d)(1)(4) of EO 12866.Agencies have the option of including activities that will have an action beyond 12 months. However, such entries should be limited to rulemakings for which listing in the Unified Agenda will provide a benefit to users. Agency agendas also should include actions or reviews completed or withdrawn since the last Unified Agenda.In What Format Will the Spring 2017 Edition of the Unified Agenda Be Published? The Unified Agenda will be available online, in its entirety, at www.reginfo.gov, in a format that offers users the ability to obtain information easily from the Unified Agenda database. Publication in the Federal Register is mandated for the regulatory flexibility agendas required by the RFA, and therefore it will continue. Agency agendas printed in the Federal Register will consist of the following:The agencys Unified Agenda preamble;Rules that are in the agencys regulatory flexibility agenda, in accordance with the RFA, because they are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities; andAny rules that the agency has identified for periodic review under section 610 of the RFA.Printing of these entries will be limited to fields that contain information required by the RFAs agenda requirements (5 U.S.C.  602). Additional information on these entries will be available in the Unified Agenda published on the Internet. If an agency has no entries in the printed Federal Register version of the Unified Agenda, its preamble will not be printed. Under Federal Register regulations, GPO Access will have the same content as the printed Federal Register.How Will the Printed Edition of the Unified Agenda Be Organized? The portion of the Unified Agenda that will be printed in the Federal Register for Spring 2017 will, in general, follow the organizational pattern of prior editions of the Unified Agenda, displaying only the information required in the regulatory flexibility agenda, along with agency preambles. Part II of the Federal Register on the day of publication will have RISCs Introduction to the Unified Agenda. The individual agency agendas will then appear in separate parts, organized alphabetically in four groups: Cabinet departments; other executive agencies; the Federal Acquisition Regulation, a joint authority; and independent regulatory agencies. Departments may be divided into their component agencies. If an agency has no entries in the printed Federal Register version of the Agenda, its preamble will not be printed, and the agency will not have a separate part in the Federal Register.Each agencys part of the Unified Agenda begins with a preamble providing information specific to that part. RISC will provide a table of contents for each agency after the agencys preamble. The table of contents will list the agencys printed entries. Agencies should consider including in their Unified Agenda preambles a statement indicating that the agencys complete regulatory agenda is available online at www.reginfo.gov. RISC provides some suggested language for this purpose in the Unified Agenda News section of RISCs website.Each agency presents its entries, divided by sub-agency if applicable, under one of five headings according to the rulemaking stage of the entry. The stages are:Prerule Stageactions agencies will undertake to determine whether or how to initiate rulemaking. Such actions occur prior to an NPRM and may include an ANPRM or a review of existing regulations.Proposed Rule Stageactions for which agencies plan to publish an NPRM as the next step in their rulemaking process or for which the closing date of the NPRM Comment Period is the next step.Final Rule Stageactions for which agencies plan to publish a final rule or an interim final rule or to take other final action as the next step.Long-Term Actionsitems under development but for which the agency does not expect to have a regulatory action within the 12 months after publication of this edition of the Unified Agenda. Some of the entries in this section may contain abbreviated information.Completed Actionsactions or reviews the agency has completed or withdrawn since publishing its last Unified Agenda. This section also includes items the agency began and completed between issues of the Unified Agenda.Some agencies use Agency Sort Codes to arrange the order of their entries in the printed Unified Agenda, with the final sort by regulation identifier number (RIN). OMB has also asked agencies to include RINs in the headings of their Final and Proposed Rule Documents published in the Federal Register to make it easier for the public and agency officials to track the publication history of regulatory actions through their development.A bullet () preceding the title of an entry indicates that the entry is appearing in the Unified Agenda for the first time.All entries are numbered sequentially from the beginning to the end of the printed publication. The sequence number preceding the title of each entry identifies the location of the entry in this edition. The printed Unified Agenda will not have any separate indexes.How Will the Online Unified Agenda Be Organized? The entire Unified Agenda will be available online at www.reginfo.gov. The Unified Agenda will be presented in the form of a searchable database, rather than as a single document that is ordered according to a prescribed sequence. Users will be able to view an individual agencys complete agenda. The Unified Agenda will have an alphabetical Subject Matter Index based on the Federal Register Thesaurus of Indexing Terms. Because the online Unified Agenda will not utilize sequence numbers, the Subject Matter Index will be linked to individual entries by hyperlinked RINs. Each individual entry may be viewed in its entirety.What Information Appears for Each Regulation Included in the Agency Agenda? All entries in the online Unified Agenda contain uniform data elements including, at a minimum, the following information:Title of the Regulationa brief description of the subject of the regulation.Priorityan indication of the significance of the regulation. Agencies assign each entry to one of the following five categories of significance:Economically SignificantAs defined in EO 12866, a rulemaking action that will have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or will adversely affect in a material way the economy; a sector of the economy; productivity; competition; jobs; the environment; public health or safety; or State, local, or tribal governments or communities.

In some instances, agencies may indicate what the next action will be, but the date of that action is To Be Determined. Agencies indicate this by entering a date in the form 00/00/0000. Next Action Undetermined indicates the agency does not know what action it will take next.For every entry that is not a completion, it is important that you provide in the Timetable section an estimated date for the Next Actionthe first action scheduled to occur on or afteror indicate Next Action Undetermined.Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Requiredwhether the RFA requires an analysis because the rulemaking action is likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as defined by the Act.Small Entities Affectedthe types of small entities (businesses, governmental jurisdictions, or organizations) on which the rulemaking action is likely to have an impact as defined by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Agencies have the option of indicating likely effects on small entities even though they believe that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis will not be required.Government Levels Affectedwhether the action is expected to affect levels of government and, if so, whether the governments are State, local, tribal, or Federal.International Impactswhether the regulation is expected to have international trade and investment effects, or otherwise may be of interest to our international trading partners.Federalismwhether the action has federalism implications as defined in EO 13132.

These elements are: Title; Section 610 Review, if applicable; Legal Authority; Abstract; Timetable; Regulatory Flexibility Analysis Required; Agency Contact; and Regulation Identifier Number (RIN). In Fall editions, all entries in The Regulatory Plan are printed in full in the Federal Register.How Should an Agency Prepare Its Data for Publication in the Unified Agenda? Agencies participating in the Unified Agenda should submit their respective portions in the uniform format specified in the instructions of RISC. RISC edits and compiles the Unified Agenda on behalf of OIRA.Agencies have three alternative methods to prepare data on individual entries for publication in the Unified Agenda:Direct Entry. The agency establishes a connection to the RISC/OIRA Consolidated Information System (ROCIS) from one or more of its own computer terminals, through an Internet browser. Agency personnel should enter data directly into the ROCIS database.Data File. An agency that stores its Unified Agenda data in its own database may choose to transmit to ROCIS all of its data in electronic files prepared according to the specific file format prescribed by RISC. Please note that to allow sufficient time for editing, it is especially important to submit data files prior to the deadline. If you are interested in data file submission, contact RISC for further information.Paper Forms. Agencies that cannot use direct entry or submit a data file may choose to submit their Unified Agenda entries on paper forms. The RISC staff will key the data into ROCIS. For entries that will appear for the first time, please use only the Spring 2017 edition of the Regulatory Information Data Form. You can print copies of this form from http://reginfo.gov/public/jsp/regform/download.jsp. To update entries that appeared in the 2016 Unified Agenda, you should submit marked copies of Agenda Review Reports that you have obtained from RISC.Reports. ROCIS provides agencies with two main reports: The Agenda Review Report, which is a printout of the agencys entries, and the Error Report, which lists inaccurate or missing data. These reports may be run for all of an agencys entries, for entries updated since a specified date, or for a particular RIN or set of RINs. For each agency that prepares its agenda by direct entry or data file, ROCIS provides the agencys agenda contact staff the ability to generate and print out these reports on the agencys own printers. Please use the Agenda Review Report to review the content of your submission; you should use the Error Report to help you correct any errors and supply any missing data.Preambles. If you are designating section 610 reviews in the Unified Agenda, your preamble should include a reference to section 610 reviews. Each direct entry or data file agency must save from ROCIS to its own computer system a copy of its preamble from the preceding Unified Agenda. Please make changes in that file to update the preamble for the previous Unified Agenda (the Fall edition) and then upload the file to ROCIS. Do not cut and paste into ROCIS. Print the preamble file you are uploading for the required, signed copies of preambles (see below).For further information about these procedures, please contact RISC.What Documents and Information Should an Agency Submit? Each agency should submit the following documents and information to RISC:One signed original and two certified copies of the preamble to its Unified Agenda entry. (Please note that the signature is required to be that of the person whose name and title are typed in the documents signature block. One person may not sign for another person.) The preamble must meet the normal requirements for printing in the Federal Register, including a list of CFR chapters pertaining to the agency.(For agencies that use direct entry or data file) When the agency is satisfied that its entries are complete, accurate, and represent what the agency wishes to publish, a designated person at the agency will be able to submit the entries to RISC electronically through ROCIS.(Only for agencies that choose to submit their data on paper forms) A paper copy of the agencys agenda entries. New entries should be on Regulatory Information Data Forms. Repeating entries should be on marked copies of Agenda Review Reports that the agency has obtained from RISC.A letter addressed to the Office of the Federal Register (see sample letter) authorizing RISC to assemble the agencys agenda and authorizing the Government Printing Office (GPO) to bill the agency for printing its portion of the Unified Agenda. The letter should include the agencys billing code and be delivered to RISC at 1800 F Street, NW., Room 2219F, Washington, DC 20405-0001, telephone (202) 482-7340.In addition, agencies may also identify rules or actions they would like to be considered as pending. A pending rule or action is one the agency does not plan to take action on in the coming calendar year, and does not want to include as a notable Long-Term action in the Unified Agenda itself. For internal agency tracking and overall transparency, we understand that it can be important to retain consistent RINs over time; identifying a rule or action as pending allows the agency to preserve the existing RIN for that rulemaking so that the RIN is available to the agency in subsequent Unified Agenda publication cycles.When and How Should Agencies Submit Their Agendas? The deadline for submission of all completed agenda materials is March 31, 2017. This is a firm deadline.Agencies should submit the applicable forms and other required documents to RISC.RISC will then assemble the entire Unified Agenda and arrange for online publication at www.reginfo.gov. RISC will also ensure that all agency regulatory flexibility agendas are compiled and forwarded to GPO for printing in a single days issue of the Federal Register.GPO will bill each agency for the cost of printing its portions of the Unified Agenda that appear in the Federal Register. Because the Unified Agenda is submitted by RISC to GPO for publication in a fully coded format, agencies receive the maximum discount from GPOs regular charges.How Can Agencies Obtain Further Information? For further information concerning the content requirements of agency agendas, contact your agencys OIRA desk officer.For further information concerning automated agenda production, specific data requirements, format, completion, or submission of agency agendas, contact the Regulatory Information Service Center, 1800 F Street NW, Room 2219F, Washington, DC 20405-0001; telephone (202) 482-7340.",20954.34,-51.36999999999898,5849.17,-21.579999999999927,2375.31,-7.809999999999945
275,2017-03-06,"Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security","MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE         THE ATTORNEY GENERAL         THE SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITYSUBJECT: Implementing Immediate Heightened Screening and Vetting of Applications for Visas and Other Immigration Benefits, Ensuring Enforcement of All Laws for Entry into the United States, and Increasing Transparency among Departments and Agencies of the Federal Government and for the American PeopleBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. 1101et seq., and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I hereby direct the following:Section 1. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to keep its citizens safe from terrorist attacks, including those committed by foreign nationals. To avert the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may aid, support, orcommit violent, criminal, or terrorist acts, it is critical that the executive branch enhance the screening and vetting protocols and procedures for granting visas, admission to the United States, or other benefits under the INA. For that reason, in the executive order entitled, ""Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,"" and issued today, I directed the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State and the Director of National Intelligence, to conduct a review to ""identify whether, and if so what, additional information will be needed from each foreign country to adjudicate an application by a national of that country for a visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat.""While that comprehensive review is ongoing, however, this Nation cannot delay the immediate implementation of additional heightened screening and vetting protocols and procedures for issuing visas to ensure that we strengthen the safety and security of our country.Moreover, because it is my constitutional duty to ""take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,"" the executive branch is committed to ensuring that all laws related to entry into the United States are enforced rigorously and consistently.Sec. 2. Enhanced Vetting Protocols and Procedures for Visas and Other Immigration Benefits. The Secretary of State and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall, as permitted by law, implement protocols and procedures as soon as practicable that in their judgment will enhance the screening and vetting of applications for visas and all other immigration benefits, so as to increase the safety and security of the American people. These additional protocols and procedures should focus on:(a) preventing the entry into the United States of foreign nationals who may aid, support, or commit violent, criminal, or terrorist acts; and(b) ensuring the proper collection of all information necessary to rigorously evaluate all grounds of inadmissibility or deportability, or grounds for the denial of other immigration benefits.Sec. 3. Enforcement of All Laws for Entry into the UnitedStates. I direct the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the heads of all other relevant executive departments and agencies (as identified by the Secretary of Homeland Security) to rigorously enforce all existing grounds of inadmissibility and to ensure subsequent compliance with related laws after admission. The heads of all relevant executive departments and agencies shall issue new rules, regulations, or guidance (collectively, rules), as appropriate, to enforce laws relating to such grounds of inadmissibility and subsequent compliance. To the extent that the Secretary of Homeland Security issues such new rules, the heads of all other relevant executive departments and agencies shall, as necessary and appropriate, issue new rules that conform to them. Such new rules shall supersede any previous rules to the extent of any conflict.Sec. 4. Transparency and Data Collection. (a) To ensure that the American people have more regular access to information, and to ensure that the executive branch shares information among its departments and agencies, the Secretary ofState and Secretary of Homeland Security shall, consistent with applicable law and national security, issue regular reportsregarding visas and adjustments of immigration status, written in non-technical language for broad public use and understanding. In addition to any other information released by the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of Homeland Security:(i) Beginning on April 28, 2017, and by the last day of every month thereafter, the Secretary of State shall publish the following information about actions taken during the preceding calendar month:(A) the number of visas that have been issued from each consular office within each country during the reporting period, disaggregated by detailed visa category and country of issuance; and(B) any other information the Secretary of State considers appropriate, including information that the Attorney General or Secretary of Homeland Security may request be published.(ii) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall issue reports detailing the number of adjustments of immigration status that have been made during the reporting period, disaggregated by type of adjustment, type and detailed class of admission, and country of nationality. The first report shall be issued within 90 days of the date of this memorandum, and subsequent reports shall be issued every 90 days thereafter. The first report shall address data from the date of this memorandum until the report is issued, and each subsequent report shall address new data since the last report was issued.(b) To further ensure transparency for the American people regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of our immigration programs in serving the national interest, the Secretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, submit to me a report detailing the estimated long-term costs of the United States Refugee Admissions Program at the Federal, State, and local levels, along with recommendations about how to curtail those costs.(c) The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, shall, within 180 days of the date of this memorandum, produce a report estimating how many refugees are being supported in countries of first asylum (near their home countries) for the same long-term cost as supporting refugees in the United States, taking into account the full lifetime cost of Federal, State, and local benefits, and the comparable cost of providing similar benefits elsewhere.Sec. 5. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b) This memorandum shall be implemented consistent withapplicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c) All actions taken pursuant to this memorandum shall beconsistent with requirements and authorities to protect intelligence and law enforcement sources and methods, personally identifiable information, and the confidentiality of visa records. Nothing in this memorandum shall be interpreted to supersede measures established under authority of law to protectthe security and integrity of specific activities and associations that are in direct support of intelligence and law enforcement operations.(d) This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the UnitedStates, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.(e) The Secretary of State is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in theFederal Register.DONALD J.

280,2017-03-07,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 3/7/2017, #18","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:36 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Hey, guys. I brought a guest. Good afternoon. First off, at the top, I want to acknowledge that theres been an additional wave of threats to Jewish community centers and Anti-Defamation League offices. According to some reports, there have been over a hundred bomb threats phoned in to Jewish institutions since the start of this year alone. As the President said at the beginning of his joint address, We're a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its forms. We denounce these latest anti-Semitic and hateful threats in the strongest terms. It is incredibly saddening that I have to continue to share these disturbing reports with you, and I share the Presidents thoughts that he fervently hopes that we don't continue to have to share these reports with you. But as long as they will -- as long as they do continue, we'll continue to condemn them and look at ways in which we can stop them.Now, on to news of the day. You saw President Trump yesterday continue to deliver on two of his most significant campaign promises: protecting the country against radical Islamic terrorism, and repealing and replacing Obamacare with a patient-centric alternative. We talked a lot about the executive order protecting the nation from foreign terrorists entering the United States yesterday. And so, on to Obamacare. I'd like to introduce the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, to come up and talk to you a little bit about the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.Dr. Price.SECRETARY PRICE: Thanks, Sean. Good afternoon. First, let me just share with you what an honor it is to serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. I'm the third physician out of 23 individuals whove had the privilege of serving as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. And the mission at our department is to improve the health and safety and well-being of the American people. And we take that mission very, very seriously.And for many Americans, right now, their ability to gain healthcare or health coverage is a real challenge. For most Americans, they receive their health coverage through their employer. It's about 175 million folks. Those individuals will see no significant change other than there won't be a penalty for not purchasing coverage. For the folks in the Medicare system, there will be no changes at all in the current law. But we're talking about those people in the individual and small-group market, the moms and pops, the folks who run the corner grocery store, the corner cleaners. Those individuals out there are having huge challenges gaining care and gaining coverage.And then Medicaid is a program that by and large has decreased the ability for folks to gain access to care, and we want to make certain that we address that.This is about patients. This is not about money. This is not about something else. This is about patients. And sadly, the costs are going up for those folks in the individual and small-group market. The access is going down, and it's only getting worse. You know the stories. Premiums increased 25 percent over the last year, on average. Arizona had an increase of 116 percent. Deductibles are going up for many, many folks. If you're a mom or a dad out there and you make $40,000, $50,000, $60,000, your deductible in this market, in that individual and small-group market, oftentimes is $8,000, $10,000, $12,000 a year.What that means is youve got an insurance card but you don't get care because you can't afford the deductible. And we know that this is happening by talking to the folks who are out there trying to provide the care.A third of the counties in the United States -- one-third of the counties in the United States have only one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Five states only have one insurer offering coverage on the exchange. One insurer is not a choice. So we need to make certain that we correct that.In Tennessee this morning, it was announced that there are a number of counties that have no insurer offering coverage on the exchange. Insurers are leaving the market on the exchange. Last year there were 232 insurers that were providing coverage -- that were offering coverage on the exchange; now there are 167. That's a loss of about 30 percent in one year alone. And all of this means that patients are not getting the care that they need.Now, the principles that we have as our guiding star are affordability, we want a system thats affordable for everybody. Accessibility, we need a system thats accessible for everybody. A system thats of the highest quality, a system that incentivizes innovation in the healthcare system, and a system that empowers patients through both transparency and accountability.The President spoke last week, last Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, and he laid out his principles. First, wanted to make certain that those with preexisting illness and injury were not priced out of the market. Nobody ought to lose their coverage because they get a bad diagnosis.In terms of affordability, health savings accounts -- growing choices for patients is incredibly important. Tax credits that allow individuals to be able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, not that the government forces them to buy. Weve always talked about -- in terms of what kinds of reforms need to be put in place, that we need to equalize the tax treatment for the purchase of coverage. Those, again, in the employer-sponsored market, they get a tax benefit for buying health coverage. Those folks that are out there in the individual and small-group market, no tax benefit. And thats what this plan would do.State flexibility. Its incredibly important that we allow the states to be the ones that are defining what health coverage is, have the flexibility, especially in the Medicaid program, to be able to respond to their vulnerable population.Lawsuit abuse. The President mentioned, and its incredibly important, that -- the practice of defensive medicine wastes billions and billions of dollars every single year, and we need to make certain that were addressing that as well. The President also talked about a glide path, an appropriate transition to this new phase for healthcare for our country, and thats important as well so that nobody falls through the cracks. Buying across state lines, buying insurance across state lines. The President talked about this on the campaign over and over. The American people understand the commonsense nature of purchasing across state lines, and it increases competition. And we need to make certain that that happens, and then addressing the incredible increase in drug prices.There are three phases of this plan. One is the bill that was introduced last evening in the House of Representatives. Thats the start of all of this. Second are the all the regulatory modifications and changes that can be put into place. As you all well know, the previous administration used regulations to a fare-thee-well -- in fact, there were 192 specific rules that were put out as they relate to Obamacare, over 5,000 letters of guidance and the like. And we are going to go through every single one of those and make certain that if they help patients, then we need to continue them. If they harm patients or increase costs, then obviously they need to be addressed. And then theres other legislation that will need to be addressed that cant be done through the reconciliation process.So the goal of all of this is patient-centered healthcare, where patients and families and doctors are making medical decisions, and not the federal government. We commend the House for the introduction of the bill yesterday and we look forward to working with all individuals in this process. And I look forward to a few questions. Yes, sir.Q  Mr. Secretary, youre familiar from your time in the House with the clout that conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Heritage Action have with rank-and-file members. What does it say about this legislation that these groups are already out with opposition to it?SECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that this is the beginning of the process. And we look forward to working with them and others to make certain that, again, we come up with that process that aligns with the principles that weve defined that they actually adhere to or agree with as well, and that is that we need a system thats affordable for folks, a system thats accessible for individuals, thats of the highest quality, that incentivizes innovation, and that empowers patients.And so we look forward to working with them through this process.Q  Secretary, Congressman Chaffetz said today that Americans may need to forgo a new iPhone to pay for healthcare, and theyll have to kind of make these choices. Does the administration agree with that? Will Americans under this plan -- will they need to maybe sacrifice other goods to pay for their healthcare? SECRETARY PRICE: This is an important question, because whats happening right now is that the American people are having to sacrifice in order to purchase coverage. And, as I mentioned, many individuals cant afford the kind of coverage that they have right now. So theyve got that insurance card but they dont have care. What our desire is, is to drive down the healthcare costs for everybody. And the way that you do that is to increase choices for folks, increase competition, return the regulation of healthcare where it ought to be, which is at the state level, not at the federal level. All of these things that, taken in their aggregate, will in fact decrease the costs of healthcare and health coverage, and that will allow folks to be able to purchase the coverage that they want.Yes, sir.Q  Thank you, Dr. Price. I have two questions for you. First has to do with guarantees that you can make as the administrations point person on this legislation. Can you guarantee that whatever legislation emerges and makes it to the Presidents desk will allow individuals, if they like their doctor they can keep their doctor? And the second guarantee is, can you also guarantee that healthcare premiums for individuals will come down with this new legislation?SECRETARY PRICE: Again, a remarkably important question because, as youll recall, the promise from the last administration was if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor, if you like your plan you can keep your plan. Both of those promises turned out to be not true.We think its incredibly important for the American people to be able to select the physician and the place where theyre treated themselves, that the government ought not be involved in that process. And so our goal is absolutely to make certain that individuals have the opportunity to select their physician.In terms of premiums, we believe strongly that through this whole process and as it takes effect, that well see a decrease in not only the premiums that individuals will see, but a decrease in the cost of healthcare for folks. Remember, that was another promise that the previous administration made, that youd see a decrease in $2,500 on average for families across this land; in fact, what theyve seen is an increase of $2,500 or $3,000.So were going to go in the other direction. Were going to go in a direction that empowers patients and holds down costs. Yes.Q  Mr. Secretary, you are quite a distance away from conservatives with this plan in the central part of it, which is tax credits, which they see as yet another entitlement, very similar to the entitlement of Obamacare but different in form. How do you convince them, since its going to take tax credits to make this work, that they need to swallow this and move forward with the bill? I mean, youre getting an awful lot of opposition on the central tenet of this whole thing.SECRETARY PRICE: This is all about patients. And in order to provide that transition and in order to make it so that nobody falls through the cracks. We've got to have a system that allows for individuals to gain the kind of coverage that they want. And we, conservatives and others, have said for a long, long time that we believe it's important to equalize the tax treatment for those purchasing coverage, gaining coverage through their employer, and those not. And the tax credit is the opportunity to be able to equalize that tax treatment. Folks have talked about this for many, many years, actually, so that there's not a distortion in the tax code for who's able to gain a benefit for being able to purchase coverage and not.Q  Sir, Mr. Secretary, you were talking about making sure people don't fall through the cracks. The last administration, with Obamacare, focused in on making sure the underserved were part of the equation. What is the safety net or the safeguard that you have to make sure -- to ensure people don't fall through the cracks beyond the tax incentives, but also for the underserved, who are now part of -- many are now part of the program that weren't before, prior to Obamacare.SECRETARY PRICE: Yes, this is extremely important as well. And the current system, as you likely know, for those vulnerable in our population, especially in the Medicaid population, this is a system that's broken. You've got a third of the physicians in this country -- one-third of the doctors in this country that would be eligible to see Medicaid patients who aren't seeing Medicaid patients right now. And it's not because they've forgotten how to take care of patients, it's because of the rules that are in place that make it too onerous or too difficult for them to see Medicaid patients.So we believe that it's important to allow states to have that flexibility to fashion the program for their vulnerable population that actually responds to that population in a way that gives them the authority, them the choices, them the opportunity to gain coverage and the care that they believe most appropriate.Q  What if you find out that that is not happening when you give it to the states? Is there some type of punishment or some type of piece that you're going to put in place to make sure that that happens, that they follow through on your intent?SECRETARY PRICE: Yes, absolutely. There's accountability throughout the plan that we have that would allow for the Secretary and the Department to be certain that the individuals that we believe need to be cared for are being cared for in the state at the appropriate level. But we believe this is a partnership. This is about patients and partnership.The previous administration tended to make it about government. We believe it's about patients and partnership, and we want to partner with every single person in this land who wants to make certain that we allow the kind of choices and quality to exist.Q  The President tweeted earlier today. He described this bill as ""our wonderful new healthcare bill."" There's been a little bit of confusion. Does this represent the administration's bill? And is there anything in this bill that the administration cannot support?SECRETARY PRICE: This has been a work in progress. As you know, this has been going on for over a year. The work that I had the privilege of participating in when I served in the House of Representatives in the last Congress was open and transparent and we invited folks in to give their ideas. And tens, if not hundreds, of people had input into that process.This grew out of that, and over the past number of weeks, we've been having conversations with folks on the Hill, in the House and in the Senate, and other stakeholders. And so this is a work product that is a result of all of that process. The President and the administration support this step in the right -- what we believe is in the right direction, a step that repeals Obamacare and gets us moving in the direction of those principles that I outlined.Q  Do you support everything thats in that bill that's sitting on the table, sir? Do you support everything that's in the bill sitting on the table, sir?SECRETARY PRICE: This is a work in progress and we'll work with the House and the Senate in this process. As you know, it's a legislative process that occurs. I'm glad you pointed out the bill is on the table there. As you'll see, this bill right here was the bill that was introduced in 2009 and '10 by the previous administration. Notice how thick that is. Some of you will recall that I actually turned the pages and went through that piece of legislation in a YouTube. The pile on the right is the current bill. And what it means is that we are making certain that the process, that the decisions that are going to be made are not going to be made by the federal government. They're going to be made by patients and families and doctors.One last --Q  Mr. Secretary, given the opposition that John and others have brought up here today, does this plan already need to be salvaged in your view? And how do you do it?SECRETARY PRICE: Oh, no. You know what happens with these things. You start at a starting point, people engage and they get involved in the process, sometimes to a greater degree. Nothing focuses the mind like a bill that's currently on the table and that has a -- as a work in progress -- or in process. And well work through it.Q  So this is a starting point here?SECRETARY PRICE: This is an important process to be had. The American people have said to their elected leaders that the Obamacare process for them gaining coverage and care is not working. That's what they've said. And so we believe its important to respond to the American people and provide a healthcare system that allows for them to purchase the kind of coverage and care that they desire.Yes.Q  You said in your letter to the House chairman that necessary technical and appropriate changes might need to be made for this bill to reach the Presidents desk. So what specific changes is the White House and the administration looking for in this bill?SECRETARY PRICE: Well, as I mentioned, there are three different phases to this process. One is this bill, this legislation that's working through under the rules of reconciliation, which is a fancy term to mean that there are only certain things that you can do from a budgetary standpoint has to affect either spending or revenue. There are things that you can't do in this bill, and those we plan on doing across the horizon in phase two, which is the regulatory portion, and then in phase three, which is another piece of legislation that would be going through the House and the Senate with a majority -- supermajority in the Senate.That process will incorporate all of the kinds of things that we believe are absolutely necessary to reconstitute that individual and small-group market and to get us in a position, again, where patients and families and docs are making these decisions.Q  Mr. Secretary, bearing in mind that the CBO score isnt back yet, can you guarantee that this plan will not have a markedly negative impact on deficit or result in millions of Americans losing health insurance?SECRETARY PRICE: What I can say is that the goal and the desire I know of the individuals on the Hill is to make certain that this does not increase the cost to the federal government.Q  Mr. Secretary, two elements of the bill. I have questions about how they control costs and how they help with access. The Medicaid per-capita block grant through the states, how is that sort of fundamentally different from the Obamacare regime on Medicaid in terms of expanding access?And then the second point, why doesn't this bill do away with the cost-sharing community ratings regime that Obamacare had?SECRETARY PRICE: So the per-capita cap, Medicaid, again, is a system that doesn't work for patients. Youve got folks out there who need care, who need to see particular physicians who arent able to see them. All Americans should be saddened by the situation that we have when there are patients out there that can't get the care that they need. We believe one of the keys to providing appropriate care in the Medicaid population is allowing the states to have the flexibility to address that Medicaid population.Remember, Medicaid population is four different demographic groups. Its those who are disabled, its those who are seniors, its healthy moms and kids, by and large. Those are the four main demographic groups. And we, the federal government, force states, mostly, to take care of those individuals in exactly the same way. If you describe that to the folks back home on Main Street, they say, that doesn't make any sense at all. You need a program that's different for the healthy moms and kids to respond to their needs that's different than folks who are disabled and seniors.And so what we believe is appropriate is to say to the states, you know your population best. You know best how to care for your vulnerable population. We're going to watch you and make certain that you do so, but you know how to do that. And that will decrease costs markedly in the Medicaid program. We're wasting significant amounts of money -- not that folks are getting too much care, we're wasting it because its inefficient and theres significant abuse in the system.So in terms of the cost-sharing, I think that the cost-sharing measures are being addressed. It's important that we run through that process. This is the process where we felt the previous administration was spending money that they didn't have the authority to spend, and Congress is working through that to make certain that the rightful holders of the authority to spend money in this nation, which is the Congress of the United States, exercises that authority.Q  How does the White House and you feel about the label Trumpcare?SECRETARY PRICE: I'll let others provide a description for it. I prefer to call it patient care. This is about patients at the end of the day. This isn't about politicians. This isn't about insurance companies. This is about patients. And patients in this nation, especially those in the individual and small-group market, these are the folks.I had the privilege of going to Cincinnati last week with the Vice President to a small-business roundtable. And one of the business owners, one of the small-business owners there, said he had 18 employees last year at this time. This year, he has 15 employees -- not because he doesn't have the work, but because of the cost of health coverage for those individuals forced him -- forced him -- to let three people go.Now, they're being forced to let three people go because the federal government has put in place rules and regulations that make it virtually impossible for folks in the individual and small-group market to provide coverage for their employees. This is a system that's not working for people. So if we focus on the patients -- I'll call it patient care. If you focus on the patients, we'll get to the right answer.Q  Mr. Secretary, a major complaint -- sorry -- a major complaint of conservatives with phase one of the Obamacare repeal-and-replace is that it is missing a measure that would allow healthcare to be sold across state lines. Now, the President said this morning that that would be in either phase two or phase three. Is that something that you believe the President could do through executive action, and then you yourself could do? Or is that something that you believe has to be addressed legislatively?SECRETARY PRICE: There are different aspects to the purchase across state lines that will allow individuals to gain, again, the kind of choices that they want. Some of this might be able to be done from a regulatory or a rules standpoint. Some of it will require legislation, and that's where we're going to need the assistance of our friends on the other side of the aisle. The American people have demanded that they be able to purchase coverage across state lines, purchase coverage that they want for themselves. So whether it's through association health plans, which allows individuals who are in small-business groups, like the fellow that I just mentioned, to pool together nationally to be able to purchase coverage, or whether it's mom and dad, who don't gain coverage through their employer through something called individual health pools that allows folks to pool together solely for the purpose of purchasing coverage, even though they're not otherwise economically aligned. That allows people -- there are 18 million folks in that individual and small-group market. That would allow those individuals to be able to purchase coverage and get the purchasing power of millions. That's huge power and authority that we want to put in the hands of people, that we want to put in the hands of patients. And some of that may, in fact, require legislation.Yes, sir.Q  Mr. Secretary, thank you. Two questions but first, Congressman John Faso of New York has said that the issue of denying federal funds to Planned Parenthood should be separate from whatever healthcare bill finally emerges from Congress and is signed into law by the President. Is that the administration's position as well? And my second question is this. You mentioned earlier the people who had their healthcare plans cancelled when they thought they could keep it. I believe in your state of Georgia, more than a million people had that experience. Will some of the plans that were cancelled be able to come back under the new healthcare plan?SECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, in terms of Planned Parenthood, we think it's important that the legislature work its will on this process. It's incredibly important that we not violate anybody's conscience. We want to protect the conscience provisions that exist. It's also important to appreciate that through community health centers, the bill that's being proposed right now would allow greater access for women to healthcare in greater numbers of facilities across this land. And they've actually proposed more money for women's healthcare than currently exists. So I think that they're working their best to address that issue.In terms of whether or not old plans that were available before might be available, absolutely. And we believe that the opportunity to provide a robust market, robust choices for individuals across this land will be secured. And, again, that's one of the keys to bringing down the premium costs, of bringing down the cost for health coverage. So we're excited about that and look forward to that coming to pass.Q  If the new plan calls for repealing the revenue-generating taxes and penalties but keeping the entitlements, how is that sustainable?SECRETARY PRICE: That's the work that somebody mentioned over here -- the Congressional Budget Office score, and once the Congress receives that score, then they'll be working through that to make certain that in fact it is fiscally responsible. Imagine, if you would, however, a system where the incentives within the system are all to drive down costs, to provide greater choices and competition for folks, and respond to the specific needs of patients. And in so doing, what you do is actually get a much more efficient system for the provision and the delivery of healthcare. It's a system we don't have right now because the previous administration felt that the government -- the federal government ought to do all of this. And we've seen what came about when the federal government does all of that -- that its increasing premiums, increasing deductibles, decreasing choices. You've got a card that says you've got insurance, and you walk in, and you can't afford what it is that's trying to -- for the doctor that's trying to take care of you.So this is not a system that's working for folks in that individual and small-group market and in the exchanges.Q  Mr. Secretary, many have complained that Obamacare resulted in higher wait times in the emergency room. Will this new bill cause that? Have you have any idea on that?SECRETARY PRICE: One of the things that the previous administration said was that they were going to be able to drive folks away from one of the most expensive areas for the provision of healthcare, and that is the emergency rooms. In fact, they did just the opposite. And much of that is because of, again, the rules and the regulations that they put in place. So from our perspective, we believe that if individuals are able to purchase the kind of coverage that they want, then they'll have access to the kind of doctors and other providers that they desire, and won't need to be able to be seen in the emergency room. They'll already have the care. Emergency rooms ought to be for emergencies, not for the standard care that individuals tend to receive right now. So we believe that if you put in place the right system, then emergency rooms and emergency physicians will be able to have the opportunity to care for those individuals that appropriately present to their department.Q  Mr. Secretary, I'm interested in following up on your comment that it's important that no one vote on anything that violates their conscience. Federal funding already can't be used for abortions, but are you saying that the administration has a position on provision of birth control at these community health centers? And secondly, is the administration looking to actively withhold funding to Planned Parenthood if they continue to provide abortions, as has been reported?SECRETARY PRICE: We're working through all of those issues. As you know, many of those were through the rule-making process and we're working through that. So that's not a part of this piece of legislation right here.Q  But you dont have a view on provision of birth control and access to it? When you're talking about women's healthcare, which you brought up, and saying you wanted to expand more community funding.SECRETARY PRICE: Yeah, what we're doing, as I say, is working through the rules and the regulations to see where the previous administration was, see how they did it, and whether or not it needs to be addressed. With the understanding that what we believe is important when we look at the rules and regulations is to define whether or not that rule or regulation actually helps patients and decreases costs, or harms patients and increases costs. If it does the latter, then we need to do away it. If it does the former, then we ought to accentuate it. Q  What was the issue of conscience you were talking about? What was the issue of conscience you were talking about then?SECRETARY PRICE: To make certain that individuals in the market are not forced to do things that violate their conscience.Yes, sir.Q  Secretary, thank you, sir. Common people and the small businesses have been waiting for this new bill under President Trump. So any message, sir, for them?SECRETARY PRICE: Well, I think that this is the culmination of years of work. It's the culmination of years of concern and frustration by the American people. They knew at the time that the previous bill -- the previous law passed that it wasn't going to help them. They knew that costs were going to go up. In fact, we predicted at the time that costs would go up and that access would go down. And so this is the culmination of years of hard work by the electorate, by the citizens of this country to say that we want a system, again, that respects patients and families and doctors in these decisions.One more.Q  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The President tweeted out earlier today that he believes that hes working on a plan to have drug prices come down by spurring competition. Can you tell us a little bit about what that plan is going to be, when it might be rolled out? Is it part of these phases? And then the second question, the bill also includes a tax break for insurance executives that make more than $500,000. You said this is about patients. Why is that tax break important for this legislation?SECRETARY PRICE: To the latter, I'm not aware of that. I'll look into that.Drug pricing is really important. So many individuals are now having significant difficulty being able to afford the medications that theyve been prescribed. And it's not able to be addressed specifically in this phase one because it's not a revenue or spending issue for the federal government. So it can't be in this phase one.But in phase two and three -- which may be concurrent along with this phase one -- but in phase two and three, then we look forward to bringing solutions, to solve the remarkable challenge that patients have across this line with the increase in pricing of drugs. I've got to run. Youve got a guy right here who is going to answer all the rest of the questions. Thank you so much. God bless you.MR. SPICER: Thank you, Dr. Price.Let me just kind of continue on. The bottom line I think that the Secretary was making is that Obamacare sought to cover 20 million people and in the process it drove up costs for everybody, whether or not you were in the exchange or not. Most people get their insurance through their employers. Older populations get their healthcare through Medicare. Low-income populations get their healthcare through Medicaid. And veterans get their insurance through TRICARE. So what we're talking about here is a very defined amount of individuals that were trying to address and not affect the entire system.Obamacare turned our healthcare system on its head to address the pool of individuals who don't fall into any of the buckets that I mentioned. Our plan that we're talking about today with the House will ensure that those individuals receive the care that they need if they want an affordable cost while not sending rates skyrocketing.Obamacare was an overcomplicated bill that served the special interests and not the American people. These over 974 pages that were passed and then we were told we had to read them are filled with carve-outs by over $1 billion of healthcare- related lobbying that were spent on the year that Obamacare was crafted. Our plan, in far fewer pages, 123 -- much smaller, much bigger -- so far we're at 57 for the repeal plan and 66 pages for the replacement portion. We'll undo this. And remember, half of it, 57 of those pages, are the repeal part. So when you really get down to it, our plan is 66 pages long, half of what we actually even have there. We'll undo the massive disaster and replace it with a plan to return healthcare back to the patient.As the President outlined in his joint address, he expects five core principles to guide Congress through this healthcare process. First, ensure that the American people with preexisting conditions have access to coverage. Second, ensure a stable transition for Americans currently enrolled in the exchanges. Third, provide more equitable tax treatment through tax credits for people who already don't receive tax-advantage healthcare from their employer. And I know -- something that Secretary Price was talking about -- for the vast number of people who get their insurance through their employer, theyre getting it tax free. They are not taxed on that benefit, which is something that is not afforded to people who are in the individual market who either run a small business or are sole proprietors.Fourth, we should expand the power of health savings accounts to return control to Americans over their healthcare dollar and decisions. They should be able to choose the plan they want, not the plan that's forced on them by government. And finally, we should give our state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicare to make sure that no one is left out. This is the Obamacare replacement plan that everyone has been asking for, the plan that the President ran on, and the plan that will ultimately save the system. It's also a culmination of years of dedicated work and careful thought by Republicans to find a replacement that will best undo the damage that's been caused by Obamacare while ensuring that all Americans have peace of mind during this stable transition period.These are the principles for which conservatives have been fighting for for years. President Trump looks forward to continuing the dialogue between the administration and the Hill on saving the healthcare system.Whats important to remember is that were not going to be able to do all of this on one bill. As the Secretary mentioned, there are two other steps as well that allow us to get more of the President's plan accomplished after we pass this first important, major step.The second piece is already underway, and that's what Secretary Price can do through executive action. He has already rolled out a handful of important actions, including the major marketplace stabilization regulation, to help bring stability to the collapsing insurance market. Hell continue to enact a number of policy changes in the regulatory and administration space -- administrative space to achieve what the first step cannot because of the nature of reconciliation.The third piece of executing the President's healthcare plan is on -- requires 60 votes in legislation, maybe more depending on what we can do and when. That's how we'll move forward on the policies of purchasing across state lines, lowering drug prices -- that just came up -- and repealing any of Obamacare's premium-spiking insurance market distortions that can't be done through this current bill.Also, yesterday, in addition to speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, the President also had separate calls with Prime Minister of Japan, Abe, and South Koreas Acting President Hwang. During both of these calls the President reiterated the United States ironclad commitment to stand with Japan and South Korea in the face of the serious threat posed by North Korea.He also emphasized that the administration is taking steps to further enhance our ability to deter and defend against North Koreas ballistic missiles using a full range of the United States military capabilities.Moving on to todays schedule. This morning, the President had a call with President Kenyatta of Kenya. Well have a readout for that call soon, if its not already out. The President and First Lady also announced the official reopening of public tours here at the White House. You may have seen the President stop by to surprise greet some of the first visitors on their tour. Were looking forward to welcoming the people back to -- the American people back what is affectionately referred to as the Peoples House.We are the worlds only executive residence and office of head of state that also serves as a museum free to the people. Visiting the White House is obviously an experience thats uniquely American, and we encourage guests of all ages to come visit the White House, their house.Also this morning, the Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, held a press conference announcing that Chinese ZTE Corporation has agreed to a record-high, combined criminal and civil penalty of $1.19 billion after the company illegally shipped telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea in violation of sanctions. This civil penalty is the largest ever imposed by the Commerce Departments Bureau of Industry and Security and, pending approval from a federal judge, the combined penalties between the Commerce Department, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Treasury would be the largest fine and forfeiture ever levied by the U.S. government in such a case.This settlement tells the world that the days of flouting the U.S. sanctions regime or violating U.S. trade laws are over.President Trump is committed to ending the disrespect of American laws and American workers.So back to the schedule for a second. This morning the President also received his daily intelligence briefing. He had lunch with Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who will continue to be an important partner as the Presidents nominee for Supreme Court, Judge Gorsuch, begins the confirmation process in the next couple weeks.At this moment, the President is leading a discussion on immigration with Senator Cotton and Senator Perdue and members of White House senior staff. The President and the senators are expected to discuss the merit-based immigration reforms that the President mentioned at last weeks joint address. Later this afternoon, the President will lead a meeting with the House Deputy Whip Team focused on repeal and replace of Obamacare. There will be a pool spray at the top of that meeting. The gather time is 3:20 p.m. The President will also meet with Richard Trumka, President of the AFL-CIO. Theyre expected to discuss the importance of investing in our countrys infrastructure and renegotiating trade agreements like NAFTA. There will also be a pool spray at the top of that meeting, and well have further details on it.This evening, the President will visit with a group of Boy Scouts who are in Washington to participate in a near-century-old tradition of sharing scoutings achievement with key government officials. Looking ahead, I want to let you know that the President will be welcoming at least two foreign leaders in the coming weeks, and I expect additional announcements of additional leaders later. But first, next week, Chancellor Merkel of Germany will visit the White House. And the following week, the President will welcome Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq. With that, Ill kick it off with your questions. Jonathan Karl.Q  Sean, its been a full --MR. SPICER: Jonathan.Q  Thank you. (Laughter.) Sean, its been a full --MR. SPICER: Youre out of practice.Q  I know. (Laughter.) Its been a full three days since the President said that President Obama had his wires tapped, his phones tapped at Trump Tower. In those three days, has the White House come up with any evidence whatsoever to prove that allegation?MR. SPICER: I addressed this multiple times yesterday. I think the President -- we put out a statement on Sunday saying that we would have no further comment and we were asking the House and the Senate intelligence committees to look into this concern and report back.Q  Cant the President just ask the FBI director if this happened? Has he asked him?MR. SPICER: Look, I think -- no, the President has not. And I think that weve gone back and forth with you guys -- I think there is clearly a role that Congress can play in its oversight capabilities. Theyve made it very clear that they have the staff, the resources and the process. I think thats the appropriate place for this to handle. I think if we were to start to get involved you would then write stories about how we were getting involved.So its a no-win situation. I think the smartest and most deliberative way to address this situation is to ask the House and Senate intelligence committees who are already in the process of looking into this to look into this and other leaks of classified information that are troubling to our nations national security.So, as the President said in the statement on Sunday, we believe that that investigation, as well as the investigation of other classified leaks and other important information that threatens our national security, be looked into by the House and Senate intelligence committees, and then we encourage them to report back.Q  Do you believe that President Obama ordered something like this?MR. SPICER: I get that thats a cute question to ask. My job is to represent the President and to talk about what hes doing and what he wants. And he has made very clear what his goal is, what he would like to have happen. And so Ill just leave it at that. I think weve tried to play this game before. Im not here to speak for myself, Im here to speak for the President of the United States and our government.Zeke.Q  Sean, one follow-up on what Secretary Price said earlier. I think he was asked by John about whether the administration was willing to make a -- for the American people right now who like their doctor or like their health insurance plan, is the White House willing to make a commitment then today that when this replacement bill is passed, if it passes, that they will at the end of that be able to keep their doctor and keep their healthcare plan?And secondly, just changing gears radically onto -- China overnight issued some strong rhetoric promising consequences for the deployment of the THAAD missile system to South Korea. If you could respond to that.MR. SPICER: So on the first piece, I think -- look, one of the things thats important to understand about this process thats very different from when the Democrats did it -- youll recall then-Speaker Pelosi said youre going to have to read the bill to know whats in it. I think theres a big difference.This is the bill. Its right here. Its on the website. Were going through regular order. If you go to the House of Representatives website, Speaker Paul Ryans website, its listed. Everybody can read it, and its going to go through what they call regular order. Were not jamming this down anybodys throat. Its going to go through a committee process. All parties involved, all representatives in the House will be able to have input into it. I think thats the way to conduct this process, is to do it to allow people to watch the process happen in the committees, allow members of Congress to have their input in it, to make amendments, to see that we get the best bill that achieves the goal for the American people.When it was done the last time, it was jammed down peoples throat, and look what happened. You had 974 pages that people struggled to read afterwards and figure out what had just gotten passed, and the consequences were, frankly, devastating.So to your point about keeping your doctor, in a lot of cases youve lost your doctor for a couple of reasons. One, they may not participate in the plan. They may not take insurance at all anymore. Two, they may not take Medicaid -- or three, they may not take Medicaid. And the list goes on and on about why they might not be there -- or your plan, the plan that you got is no longer accessible. As the Secretary mentioned, one-third of all counties in the United States no longer take Medicaid -- or, excuse me, have only one plan that you can choose from. So its a fact right now that you -- in most cases, you have no choice. In many cases, youve lost that ability. Our goal is to actually add more choice and more competition. Right now, the government tells you, you must have this plan or you will pay a penalty, and within this plan, heres what you have to have. Weve lost the element of choice and competition in healthcare, and by bringing all of that back, I think theres a higher degree of likelihood that youre going to get the plan that you want and youre going to get the doctor you want. Because it will be your choice, not the governments choice.And thats a big, big difference. This plan was jammed down everybodys throat, and the consequences took their plans away, it took their doctors away, and it drove up costs. This plan allows more competition, more people to enter it, and the American people and patients to make a decision on what plan they want. If they have a plan and a doctor they like, then theyre going to choose a plan that allows them to continue with that doctor. But theres going to be more competition and more choice, not less. And thats, frankly, what you have now. With respect to China, I think I addressed this yesterday. We stand shoulder to shoulder with Japan and South Korea in doing what we can to protect that region in particular from an attack from North Korea. We understand the situation and we continue to work with them. As Ive mentioned, the President spoke to both leaders yesterday. We provided a readout of those calls. But we obviously understand the concerns of China, but -- this is a national security issue for them.Hunter.Q  Thank you, Sean. How concerned is the President with the situation between North Korea and Malaysia right now?MR. SPICER: Well, as I said, I think we're very well aware of the -- whats going on in the region. The President obviously had a conversation with, in particular, the leader -- the acting President of South Korea last night with respect to whats going on there. And again, Ill refer that to the National Security Committee to give you further -- Cheryl Bolen.Q  Thanks, Sean.MR. SPICER: Cheryl. I know, sorry, I forgot you yesterday.Q  I appreciate it. So two questions. One on healthcare. If the CBO scores this bill and it does not provide the amount of coverage that the Affordable Care Act did, will the President still support it?MR. SPICER: Well, Im not going to get ahead -- Secretary Price mentioned this -- lets not get ahead of the CBO going through this. But I think, as I mentioned to Zeke, one of the things that's important to understand theres -- this is -- this bill has to be done in the phases that it has to to address the repeal part of it, and the replace part of it.There are only certain things that we can do through reconciliation. I know theres the regulatory piece that we can do through actions that the Secretary is empowered to do, frankly, under Obamacare. And then third is an additional piece of legislation that addresses things.But there are cost-saving measures that -- and competition aspects of this that have to be included in phase two or three because they're not allowed in the reconciliation bill because of the nature of how reconciliation works on Capitol Hill.So I think that one of the things that we have to understand is that how that score comes out from the Congressional Budget Office will depend on whether they look at it specifically with just a phase one or whether they look at it in its totality. But Im confident that if you look at whats going on right now, Cheryl, its unsustainable. Premiums in state after state, as Dr. Price mentioned, they're up 25 percent on average. Arizona is 116 percent. I think Oklahoma is the 50s. Minnesota is in the 40s. This is unsustainable for a family to continue to pay the premiums that they have and for individuals, small-business owners, et cetera.So the question is, can we allow people to go on this trajectory where more and more of their paycheck is getting eaten up in a plan that's, frankly, not giving them choice, doctors, or plans that they want. This plan I think clearly achieves those goals a lot better. It gets the price -- cost containment down. It gets price control under it. And it allows doctors and plans to reengage in the marketplace, as they were prior to this. And I think that is a major aspect of it.Hold on. Cheryl waited.Q  Thank you. From yesterday, I had a nominations question. Is there something that's preventing the White House from submitting the nominations of Sonny Perdue for Agriculture and Alex Acosta for Labor?MR. SPICER: I believe Alex Acosta was sent up to the Hill earlier today. We should have an announcement officially out. So sometimes theres a little bit of a lag. I apologize between my office and -- but that one is up, and Ill check on Sonny Perdue. I think some of it is just in coordination with the Senate, so pardon my time.Q  Thanks, Sean. I have two questions for you. First, will the President offer a correction to his tweet this morning that states that 122 prisoners were released from Gitmo by the Obama administration and then returned to the battlefield? Can you take that first?MR. SPICER: Yes, I mean, obviously the President meant in totality the number that had been released on the battlefield -- that have been released from Gitmo since -- individuals have been released. So that is correct.Q  Then my second question. Is the White House concerned about this new information that came out in WikiLeaks today that U.S. intelligence agencies are potentially, purposely providing vulnerabilities to tech products here in the United States?MR. SPICER: Im not going to comment on that. I think obviously that's something that has not been fully evaluated, and if it was, I would not comment from here on that.Kevin.Q  Yes, Sean, I was going to ask about branding. The President in the past put his name on buildings and different products. When it comes to healthcare, does the White House feel that the bill presented today should be known as Trumpcare from here on out? I know it was asked of the Secretary. And at what point do you think that the transition should go away from Obamacare to the new administration?MR. SPICER: Well, as soon as its repealed we can get rid of that. I think that will happen quickly.And as Secretary Price mentioned, I think we're less concerned with labels right now and more in terms of action and results. And I think that's what our focus has been is getting that cost down, getting that choice back that we mentioned. Yeah.Q  Sean, DHS is reportedly considering separating families that cross the border illegally. How does the President feel about that?MR. SPICER: Im going to -- that's a DHS matter. We don't get involved in either Customs or ICE enforcement. So I think that's a question better reserved to both DHS and ICE specifically.Jim.Q  Oh, thanks, Sean. On the Obamacare question, one of the criticisms on this is that there is still a de facto individual mandate because it allows insurance companies to increase premiums up to 30 percent of people -- if theres a gap in coverage. And I have one more. MR. SPICER: Well, that's not -- the difference is under the current bill that's here, if you don't buy insurance, you pay a fine. Under the current bill you don't have -- theres nothing that mandates you to buy insurance. That's up to an individual. So by its very definition, it is not -- can't be considered that.Whats your second one?Q  Well, you don't think its a de facto mandate in the sense of theres a penalty --MR. SPICER: It can't be.Q  -- in place as there is now? Not by the government, but is by the insurance companies.MR. SPICER: Right. But theres no -- I think you answered your own question on that one. Q  I have one more.MR. SPICER: Okay.Q  Another topic. The President has blamed the Democrats in the Senate for blocking the Cabinet. Last Thursday, the Republicans actually called a recess early -- adjourned on Thursday early. Previously they called a recess the week before. Does the President have any plans to call for the Senate to remain in session and the Congress to stay in session until they approve the nominees and maybe even also repeal Obamacare?MR. SPICER: This isnt a Republican issue. I mean its not Republicans that are playing beat the clock on a lot of these nominees. And we've discussed this since the transition time. There were several nominees that, frankly, werent even considered controversial by the standards of Senate Democratic leadership, and yet have been held up over and over again. I don't think -- that's a very different scenario than going back and being with constituents, which was on the Senate schedule. So I don't think -- that's a synonymous thing.Do we have Michael Medved ready to go for a Skype question? Michael?Q  Yes, hello. Sean, thank you very much. Obviously, today there was a big emphasis on Obamacare, which is profoundly important to the American people. But it seems that too often in the last several weeks, the administration has gotten distracted and media have gotten distracted by talk of wiretapping at Trump Tower, or the President calling his predecessor a bad and sick guy or criticizing the ratings of Celebrity Apprentice. Do you think the White House could do a better job of focusing on the issues that really matter, the reforms that matter to the American people rather than getting distracted to these subsidiary conflicts as we move forward into the coming months?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Michael. Respectfully, I would say that we have been focused. We're here talking about Obamacare and the need to drive down the cost and access for healthcare for every American. I think that's a pretty significant thing to be focused on.Yesterday, we were talking about the Presidents effort to continue to keep the nation safe, to make sure that people arent coming into the country who arent here for peaceful purposes. The President has talked to almost 50 world leaders. Hes had 30-plus executive actions on all sorts of stuff from regulatory aspects to things that will create more jobs. I think that's a fairly focused effort.That being said, I think, look, whether it was Candidate Trump, President-elect Trump, or now President Trump, the President has always made it very clear -- or not he made it clear, but I think the voters made it clear that one of the things that they appreciate about him is his ability to be authentic and to speak very forcefully and very directly with the American people. And that's an aspect that I think was central to why he was elected, is because hes not a canned politician that's going to give the same staid answers over and over again.Sara.Q  Going back to Freds question, conservatives have started to call this Obamacare Lite. But President Trump has promised to fully repeal Obamacare, but this bill leaves a lot of the structure of Obamacare intact. If this is the policy that passes, is President Trump confident in the future he can say that he fully repealed Obamacare?MR. SPICER: Yeah, absolutely. As I mentioned, the first half of the bill that we put forward repeals it. There are three things, I mean -- each phase that we've talked about, phase one, phase two, and phase three, theres a repeal-and-replace aspect in each one. But Republicans and conservatives have been talking about adding competition and driving costs down for decades now, selling across state lines, small-business pooling. All of those things have been part of conservative plans for a long time. And I think instilling that competition in it, allowing more access -- I think there is a big difference. There is no -- we have for the longest time -- if you're a conservative, you think about this right now that you have -- anyone who has an employer-based -- their job comes from an employer that gives them healthcare, they're getting a subsidy. They're getting a credit. They don't pay taxes on their healthcare, and their employer doesn't either. That's a huge disadvantage to anyone who is a sole proprietor or owns a small business. And so, frankly, to allow the playing field to be leveled and allow small businesses, which are, frankly, the job creators in this country, to allow entrepreneurs and self-starters to get the same tax treatment that a Fortune 500 company gets you is a very conservative principle.And again, look, one of the things that's important, Sara, is for all of the people who have concerns about this -- especially on the right -- look at the size. This is the Democrats, this is us. You can't get any clearer in terms of this is government, this is not.And I think that part of the reason the visual is important is that when you actually look at the difference, you realize this is what big government does. It crowds out competition. It drives up prices. It stifles entrepreneurship and innovation. Doctors leaving the markets. More and more people not taking Medicaid or TRICARE. That should concern people. When you've got veterans that can't -- because most of the time, Medicaid and TRICARE are tied together. So when you have those systems not accepted by doctors, that means the lowest of our -- people on the low-income scale and people who have served our country have fewer and fewer choices. That alone should be a problem and concerning for many people. But the premium spikes are another problem. Because again, even if you're in the exchange, now you're seeing over and over again that happen. You're also seeing young people decide that theyd rather just pay a penalty because the cost of those basic programs is out of reach for a lot of young people who are just entering the job market.But again, I think the greatest illustration of the differences in the approaches is that size. Our bill, which is a tenth of the size, does repeal and replace in what their bill just did in massive government bureaucracy. And that is a big difference. Jim.Q  Just want to ask you -- I mean you had the Health and Human Services Secretary out here, you just talked about this is the Republican bill, this is the Democrat bill. Is that the Presidents bill? Is that his healthcare bill?Q  That is a bill that we have worked with with Congress. We feel very good about where it is. We are looking forward -- as I mentioned earlier, the President is meeting with the Whip Team to encourage them to support it and to build it out. I don't think -- and I'm not trying to be cute here -- but I think it's not his bill or their bill. It's a bill that we have worked on with them together. We're very proud of where it stands now.The big difference, Jim, is that, unlike before, as I mentioned, when the Democrats jammed it down peoples throat and said -- waited to get that 60th vote, with Senator Kennedy still around, and then basically said, literally, you will have to wait and see what it looks like before we passed it -- we not only posted it out there for everybody to look at, but by sending it through regular order, not just putting it up for a House vote, but sending it through the committee process, allows Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike to offer up amendments and suggestions. And the House will work its will.Now, we will continue to give guidance and thoughts and suggestions. But I think the Presidents core principles are whats going to guide us as we head through the Hill and then -- the House and then to the Senate.Q  And just one quick follow-up on Jonathan Karls question, because the President made a very serious allegation over the weekend, and I think we would all be remiss if we went through this briefing and not tried to get you on camera to at least offer us some evidence. Where is the evidence, where is the proof that President Obama bugged President Trump?MR. SPICER: Well, I answered this question yesterday on camera on your air. So just so we're clear -- I know this is now -- it will be twice. But I think I made it clear yesterday --Q  But since yesterday, since yesterday --MR. SPICER: Nothing has changed.Q  -- is there any new proof --MR. SPICER: No. And it's not a question of new proof or less proof, or whatever. The answer is the same, which is that I think that there is a concern about what happened in the 2016 election. The House and Senate intelligence committees have the staff and the capabilities and the processes in place to look at this in a way that's objective. And that's where it should be done. And, frankly, if youve seen the response from -- especially on the House side, but as well as the Senate, they welcome this.And so lets let the Senate do their job and the House -- excuse me -- intelligence committees, and then report back to the American people.Q  Will the President withdraw the accusation? Does he have any --MR. SPICER: Why would he withdraw it until it's adjudicated? That's what we're asking, is for them to look at this and see if there is --Q  No regrets with him about raising this accusation?MR. SPICER: No. Absolutely not. And I think that what he wants them to do is to look into wiretapping, other surveillance, and again, as I mentioned before, the other leaks that are threatening our national security. You're seeing the leaks happen over and over again that come out throughout the administration, throughout government, and undermine national security. And I think the appropriate thing to do is to ask the House and the Senate to look into it.Glenn Thrush.Q  To follow up on a follow-up, in terms of -- you were given the opportunity on air to say whether or not the President still supported Director Comey. Does the President support Director Comey? And I have a quick follow-up.MR. SPICER: I have no reason to believe he doesnt. He has not suggested that to me. So now to the non-follow-up to the --Q  Have you seen any evidence yourself? Has the evidence been shared with you or other senior members of the Presidents staff as to why he made this particular accusation?MR. SPICER: As far as me, no. I'm not in a position that that would be regularly part of my daily duties for the President to sit down and go through that. That's probably a level above my pay grade. But as Ive mentioned, I think the President believes that the appropriate place for this to be adjudicated is for the House and Senate intelligence committees who have the clearances, the staff, the processes, to go through this, look at it and report back.Q  Did he share it with --MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get in -- as the President made very clear, Glenn --Q  -- with his National Security Advisor?MR. SPICER: As the President said in the statement that he issued on Sunday, we're not going to have further comment on this until this matter is resolved.Yes.Q  Two quick questions. So just to follow up on the follow-up. So does the White House feel that it's appropriate -- you say that you want it to be adjudicated by the congressional committees, but the President made declarative statements on Twitter.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  So I guess, is the White House position that the President can make declarative statements about a former President basically committing a crime and then the congressional committees should look into that and basically prove it? I mean, how does that exactly --MR. SPICER: I take issue with -- it's not a question of prove it. I think as I said, now, five times to a follow-up to a follow-up, that it's not a question of prove it. It's that they have the resources and the clearances and the staff to fully and thoroughly and comprehensively investigate this and then issue a report as to what their findings are. Q  But President Trumps Twitter statement shouldnt be taken at face value about what --MR. SPICER: Sure it should. Of course, it -- I mean, why-- no. Theres nothing -- as I mentioned to Jim, it's not that hes walking anything back or regretting. Hes just saying that they have the appropriate venue and capabilities to review this.Margaret. I'm sorry.Q  So on the Obamacare replacement, so you said that it will be in phases and that you're going to need additional legislation. So just to clarify, are the cost savings that you guys are projecting, is that dependent on phase three of the national competition plan? Because if thats the case then -- MR. SPICER: Yeah, well, it's not dependent. I think that in order to see it fully come to fruition, yeah, you have to see all parts of it. But the way that it was passed doesn't allow for -- the way that it was passed is almost the same way that we're going through this now, which is they pass certain things, then the Secretary of Health and Human Services, at the time, was granted significant regulatory authority that allowed her to do certain things at the time to implement pieces of Obamacare that we now have to act backwards and go almost in the same steps to do what they did to lay it out. We've got to repeal it, and then we've got to replace it with the plan that's going to do the same.Certain things can be done in the same way and certain things can't. It just -- it literally depends on how that was done.John Frederick.Q  Sean, in the replacement plan, it says that the states that accepted the Medicare expansion money would continue to be funded. So what is the message you have to Republican state legislators that thought they were fiscally responsible in rejecting Medicaid expansion in their states and now they didn't get the federal dollars on either end? What is your response to them?MR. SPICER: I think what we need to do is to make sure, as the President said in his statements, as Secretary Price did, we've got to make sure that we continue to protect people through this transition process. Let the bill work its way. But this is the first time -- as we address the Medicaid portion of this, this is probably the first time that we've really addressed an entitlement aspect of something in almost 30 years. So I think we've got to let this piece of it work its way through the House.But there is -- remember, one of the things that happened through the Medicaid expansion was the goal has always been about Medicaid to help people who were disabled or poor or met a specific number of criteria. For the first time in Obamacare, we expanded Obamacare -- or the Obama administration did, rather -- to able-bodied individuals that -- in a way that had never been done before, and it was not a specific class. That's led largely to the ballooning cost.I think a lot of the reforms that will be contained in this bill will address that, but I think we've got to let it work its will through the process.Alexis.Q  Sean, I want to ask you two communications questions on two topics. Because the President gave himself a middling grade on communication, let me ask you about the experience that the previous administration had when Obamacare was going through its own phases. The President -- President Obama said that the opposition to the legislation was able to seize the opportunity while it was being legislated to create public perceptions about what was in the legislation. So my question is on ACA. What is the President going to do to improve his communications, to be out there, explaining what is in the bill, to work with lawmakers? That's the first question. And then I'll ask you the next one.MR. SPICER: Okay, thank you. So on the first one, as Ive mentioned, hes had and continues to have significant outreach to members of Congress. He's talked to health insurers. I mean, I think we've read out a lot of the activities of the last couple weeks. And literally, in just -- within an hour, he's going to sit down with the House Deputy Whip Team to talk about the legislative piece of this in the House.So this is going to be a very aggressive, laser-like focus of this administration over the next month or two to get this thing through the House and then moved over to the Senate. But there's a big difference, Alexis. What we're doing is vastly different. They were expanding government, promising people something. And I think what's happened is there was a lot of difference with how they approach it. Right now, the American people, no matter where you are, you understand the state of your healthcare, the costs that you're seeing and the lack of choice that you've now been presented with. And in many cases, you realize that when you go in to see the doctor or a loved one is going to see a doctor that they're not getting -- they're not either able to get in, they're not taking the Medicare or the exchange insurance that they got, the costs are going out of control. And I think it's really interesting -- I mean, one of the things that Dr. Price mentioned that is so apropos of this is, having a card does not mean you have insurance. It's like handing someone a blank check -- it doesn't mean that you have money, it means you have a check. And I think what we've seen over the last few years with Obamacare is you can have an insurance card, but that doesn't mean someone is going to take it, and it sure doesn't mean that it's going to be affordable. And there's a big difference between having a card and having healthcare that's affordable. And that's the difference that we're trying to solve right now. So when it comes to communication, I think one of the things that's really helpful is that part of the sell is done for us. The American people understand the state of their healthcare. They understand how much they're paying for. They've gone to see a doctor or gone to a hospital or had a notice from their carrier saying we are no longer part of this, or their employer says, hey, whatever your particular carrier is, is no longer available, we're switching you into this. And so for so many Americans, healthcare is a very, very real part of their daily experience because they're caring for themselves, they're dealing with an ailment, or dealing with children or a loved one or someone else in their family where they're seeing, firsthand, the devastation and disaster that Obamacare has caused them in their personal life. So I think there's a welcoming of this effort and I think it's a lot easier for us to go in -- because we don't have to explain the problem. People are living it. And I think for them to understand what we're giving you is more choice, greater competition. We're incentivizing more people to be part of the process, and we're going to be driving down the cost of those premiums.You had a second.Q  My second question on communications has to do with the President's assertion about the wiretapping. Because the White House wants this now to be handled by the legislative branch, and in confidence and in classification, can we count on the President to, himself, while this investigation is going on, to cease and desist using Twitter or any other public venue to make accusations that are in public but he will not respond to in public?MR. SPICER: With respect to this particular situation? I'll ask that and I'll get back to you on that.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. Just getting back to the question about if one likes his or her healthcare, they can keep it. In 2013, Congressman Fred Upton, then Chairman of the House Energy Committee, offered legislation that put precisely those words into law and it received the votes of every Republican member in the House and between 40 and 50 Democrats, and then it died in the Senate. Would the administration support a revival of the Upton Amendment? In other words, putting the right to keep one's healthcare plan and doctor if he or she liked it, today?MR. SPICER: I mean, I think that's the goal. I don't want to start talking about what we're going to -- as we go through the process. We've now put our stamp on this and sent it to the House. It will work its will as amendments come up through regular order. Our team will weigh in on those with their staff and, again, the President is meeting with the Whip Team today.I don't want to start saying we're going to support this amendment or that amendment now, but I think generally speaking, obviously the goal is to make sure that people get a plan that they like that's affordable, that meets what they need to have met, that they shouldn't have to have a one-size-fits-all, government-instilled healthcare system that doesn't offer any choice or, frankly, isn't tailored to the needs that they have. I think that's an important thing.John.Q  Sean, right now you're two votes short of passing repeal-and-replace in the Senate because you've got four Republican senators who are saying they can't support the bill because of rolling back the Medicaid expansion. What do you say to those senators who are very concerned that people will lose coverage that this does not provide enough stability for those people who rely on Medicaid for their healthcare?MR. SPICER: Well, there's two things, John. One is, we're at day one. We're going to go through the House first, so we've got a little bit of time. And I think as we go through that process, these senators -- and not just the additional two but I think and hope that we'll get additional ones -- they recognize that those people, as I've said over and over again here -- if we do nothing, they're going to be in a very, very worse scenario than they are now.More and more people -- if you're on Medicaid, which serves so many low-income Americans, as I mentioned, they have a card. And that card does not allow them to go to doctor after doctor who are saying, we're not going to take Medicaid or TRICARE anymore. So I would ask those senators, what are you doing to help us work on a bill that will get them insured again? Because for too many Americans, they've got a card, but they don't have insurance. And I think that's a very, very big thing to -- a distinction to make.They're the ones who have the problem right now. They've got a Medicaid card and nowhere to go. And what we need to do is to make sure that low-income Americans, veterans, small business owners, individuals who desperately need healthcare have options and affordability.Q  One other piece of this. You could bring down the cost of the insurance itself through efficiencies in the system, selling across state lines. But the biggest driver of the increase in health insurance cost is the skyrocketing cost of medicine. What in this overall plan do you propose to do to either cap the rise or even bring it down?MR. SPICER: Well, I think you -- the Secretary mentioned this, but I mean, the cost of prescription drugs is --Q  That's one small --MR. SPICER: No, it's not. It's a big factor. I think that --Q  But when you're paying $50,000 out of pocket to get a stent? I mean, it's --MR. SPICER: Again, what is the biggest thing missing --Q  -- but it's getting out of control.MR. SPICER: Fair enough, but --Q  Fair enough, drugs is one part of it but -- huge other part of it.MR. SPICER: Okay, when you talk about procedures or drugs, the biggest thing that's missing in this whole equation is competition. I mean, we're down to one plan in many places. There's nothing for these places to compete --Q  Theres plenty of competition between hospitals.MR. SPICER: No, there's -- I mean, that's fine, but if they know they're going to get the same reimbursement rate, if they know that there's no other options, that plans aren't trying to get people -- then that's a big difference. Right now, there's a lack of competition in the industry. And I think one of the President's -- I get it may be one part of that, but you're right, that all-over medicine -- procedures and such -- there's a reason he met with drug executives and talked about getting those costs down; that there's a multi-faceted approach, and how do we instill competition, how do we drive down costs? But you're right, we've got to do more to get the cost of that down, of the procedures to allow additional options. Everything that is -- it's the same way that, again -- think about your insurance. One of the things that was driving up cost in the past was people were exercising the option of going to an emergency room over and over again for their primary care. And what happened is that you saw all of these ""clinics"" pop up from around and insurance carriers actually made it cheaper in terms of co-pays to go see that than an emergency room, driving people to somewhere that didn't continue to drive up cost, clog insurance. That competition alone starts saving the plans money and helping to keep cost down. We've got to instill more aspects of competition in medicine.Jennifer.Q  Sean, can you give us an update on the effort to roll back regulations? Have the taskforce -- regulatory reform taskforces identified any regulations to roll back? And have any actually been repealed?MR. SPICER: I think that they have had their work cut out for them. Theyve started as they -- the President has met with different industries and companies, corporations, associations. That is a constant subject of discussion, which is those regulatory aspects of our economy that are keeping companies from growing, expanding and hiring. And so I know that the domestic policy team and others have been working on that. And if I can get further updates on specific legislation or, excuse me, specific regulatory action, I'll get back to you.Hallie.Q  Thanks, Sean. Two topics for you. I'm trying to get some clarity on something that my colleagues have tried to follow up on as well. You've said that the President stands by his tweets Saturday morning that President Obama ordered this wiretap. You've also said that the administration wants Congress -- let me just be clear -- he found out this information. You've also said that the President wants Congress to investigate. Some members of Congress, by the way, have asked the White House and asked the President to come forward with that information. So bottom line, why would the President want Congress to investigate for information he already has?MR. SPICER: I think there's a separation-of-powers aspect here as I mentioned to Jonathan that we think it's --Q  Talk about resources and time -- why waste that?MR. SPICER: Well, it's not a question of waste it. It's a question of appropriateness. Q  But if the President has the info, Sean -- and I guess that's what I'm trying to get to -- if he's sitting on this information that he found out, he's now directing or asking or recommending that the intelligence committees look into this. And you talked about they have resources and staff, which they do, but why expend those resources and staff if the President found out this information and has it?MR. SPICER: I think there's a difference between directing the Department of Justice, which may be involved in an ongoing investigation, and asking Congress as a separate body to look into something and add credibility to the look -- adds an element that wouldn't necessarily be there if we were directing the Department of Justice, for example. But again, I think we've made it very clear how he wants this done and where we go from there.Q  Second question then. Millions of Americans are working on their tax returns right now. Will the President commit to releasing his tax returns for this year and is he still under audit for his past returns?MR. SPICER: My understanding is he's still under audit and I'll follow up on the question.Q  Question and quick follow-up. How do you understand what we've seen on the growing number of cases at the Canadian border of Canadians born and raised in Canada with valid passports being stopped at the border and told just to go back? They won't let them come in and -- in the U.S.MR. SPICER: I'm not aware of that. I think that's something that probably should be addressed to the Department of Homeland Security.Q  Do you think there might be a misunderstanding of the messages sent on the immigration --MR. SPICER: I don't know. I think it's a good question that is probably best directed towards the Department of Homeland Security. Dr. Swan.Q  Thank you. Is the White House going to keep its promise to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement? And our understanding is that there is some divisions of opinion -- Rex Tillerson wants to stay in; Steve Bannon wants to get out. Whats going on? Will you keep the promise? If not, why not?MR. SPICER: I think that's something I'd be glad to follow up with you and everyone. I don't have anything on that right now. I'm aware of the discussion of it, so let me -- if I can, I'll get back to youMike.Q  I have an unrelated question, but I also want to follow up on something --MR. SPICER: Unrelated questions are my favorite. (Laughter.)Q  You talked about the communications strategy. Will the President play a public role in selling this bill? Will he speak to the public about it? Will he answer questions about it?MR. SPICER: That's a good question. I think that we are going to have a very comprehensive strategy. As I mentioned, just a few minutes from now the President is going to engage with members of the House Whip Team to talk to them. Q  -- talking to members of Congress.  MR. SPICER: I understand that, but -- and I understand that. This is step one. Theres a lot of time -- as I mentioned, we expect to be dealing with this for the next several weeks. There will be plenty of opportunities for the President to speak about that, to engage with the public. But it's going to be a comprehensive plan that we will discuss.We had I can't even begin to tell you how many administration folks, members of Congress flooding the broadcast and radio airwaves today, both nationally and in local markets. We were very, very active throughout the country getting out the word on what we're doing and why we're doing it, from national broadcast shows to cable to -- I mean, to radio. We had a very, very aggressive start to this effort. We're working with the House, in particular. Were continuing to start really engaging with the Senate. But this is going to be a comprehensive effort, working with the House and the Senate, to get this thing done, and other partners -- doctors and outside groups that share this concern. As I mentioned earlier to one of the other folks, theres a need by companies and corporations who are feeling the weight of additional cost to join us in this effort. And I just want -- this is obviously something that needs to get dealt with. The escalating costs are having a significant impact not just on our economy, but on the ability of people to get hired, or, frankly, people who are hired leave their job because the cost of healthcare is not allowing especially people in the small- and medium-sized businesses to keep up with those costs.With that, thank you guys very much. I look forward to seeing you --Q  -- meeting tomorrow -- congressmen coming to the meeting with the President.MR. SPICER: We'll have a readout --Q  Sean, I have that unrelated question, which was --MR. SPICER: Im sorry. That's not fair. Mike gets his unrelated question.Q  And answer mine after that, please.Q  Will the Trump administration continue the Obama administrations practice of releasing publicly the visitor logs?MR. SPICER: We're currently evaluating our procedures on that and we'll have some -- and when we have an announcement I'll let you know.And, April, I'll have a readout on our schedule for tomorrow later. Q  Hes meeting tomorrow with --MR. SPICER: Once it's confirmed, I will let you know first, and then everybody else. Thank you, guys. Have a great day.END2:54 P.M.

281,2017-03-07,Remarks by President Trump and Representative Steve Scalise in Meeting with the U.S. House Deputy Whip Team,"3:34 P.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, everybody, and Mike Pence is going to be here in a few minutes. We miss Mike when he's not around. (Laughter.)So I want to thank the members of the House Deputy Whip team. It will be very important over the next number of months. We have a great team and we're going to have a lot of victories, a lot of wins, but we have a great team.Together, we're going to do incredible things for the great citizens of our country. As I said during my joint address to Congress -- and I think you mostly liked that, right? (Laughter.)PARTICIPANT: We loved that. (Laughter.)PARTICIPANT: We liked it a lot. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: We're witnessing a renewal of the American spirit, a surge of optimism and a new national pride, which is sweeping across the land. I see it -- there's such spirit, whether it's for the business things we're doing or whatever. It's such spirit that we haven't seen in the country in a long time. Jobs are pouring back here. You saw what happened with Exxon, where they just announced a massive job program. So we're going to have some fun.Now, we have to remember, Obamacare is collapsing and it's in bad shape. And we're going to take action. There's going to be no slowing down. There's going to be no waiting and no more excuses by anybody. We're all now -- I can probably say I'm a politician. (Laughter.) Okay? I am a politician. But we're going to get it done, and you're the leaders that really will get it done for all of us and for the American people. Obamacare is in very bad shape. I believe that if we wait two years, it will totally implode. It's really pretty much imploding now, Steve, when you think. But it will implode and people will be, like, please help us, please help us, and that will be the Democrats asking for help. They already are asking for help in the true sense of the word, because it's a disaster. The insurance companies are fleeing. Some states are up over 100 percent in costs. The deductibles are through the roof -- you don't even get to use it.So we're going to do something that's great, and I'm proud to support the replacement plan, released by the House of Representatives and encouraged by members of both parties. I think really that we're going to have something that's going to be much more understood and much more popular than people can even imagine. It follows the guidelines I laid out in my congressional address -- a plan that will lower costs, expand choices, increase competition, and ensure healthcare access for all Americans. This will be a plan where you can choose your doctor. This will be a plan where you can choose your plan. (Laughter.) And you know what the plan is -- this is the plan. And we're going to have a tremendous -- I think we're going to have a tremendous success. It's a complicated process, but actually it's very simple. It's called good healthcare. So I want to thank you folks for being with us today, ladies and gentlemen. And we will do something really, really important and really good for the American people. I think it's going to go very quickly. I hope it's going to go very quickly. And as you know, after that, we work on the tax cut. We're going to be planning a major tax cut. I know exactly what we're looking at -- most of us know exactly the plan. It's going to put our country in great shape and we're going to reduce taxes for companies and for people, and I can use the word again -- massively. It's going to be a big tax cut, the biggest since Reagan, maybe bigger than Reagan.So I look forward -- I really look forward to working on that, but we can't really get to that, unfortunately, because of the way your system works. We can't get to that until we take care of healthcare. So we'll take care of the healthcare. I appreciate your great support and let's get it done. Thank you. Thank you all. Fantastic. Thank you.REPRESENTATIVE SCALISE: Well, Mr. President, thank you for having our Deputy Whip team to the White House. And thank you for your commitment on following through on what, to most Americans, is probably one of the most important promises that was made not only by you, but by all of us in getting this majority -- both in the House and Senate -- and the White House, and that is rescuing the American people from the failures of Obamacare. We've heard the message for years. We've seen the dramatically skyrocketing costs. You're seeing double-digit increases every year in most part of the country in health premiums for families. Many families are seeing deductibles that rise about the $10,000 range, which means people don't have access to healthcare. People don't have the ability to choose their own doctor.You talked about this the other night in just one of the best speeches Ive heard from a President standing at that well in the House Chamber when you addressed the joint session and gave an inspirational speech to the country laying out the things that need to happen and that you're going to do to get this country back on track, and to create jobs, and to secure America.But one of the things you talked about is how its wrong that unelected bureaucrats in Washington have the ability to tell you what you can and can't buy for your family in healthcare, one of the most personal decisions families make.This bill finally starts the process of not only repealing Obamacare, but also replacing it with reforms that put patients back in charge of their healthcare decisions, that lower costs for families. Let them actually choose the decisions between them and their doctor, which are so personal.And so as we start this process, the people in this room, the chief deputy whips are the ones that are going to be working directly with members to ultimately pass this bill to your desk so that we can quickly provide that relief from Obamacare to the people of the United States. And I know we are honored to have our former House colleague and now our Vice President of the United States who has been involved in this fight from the beginning, as well, Vice President Mike Pence joining us, too.Thank you, Mr. Vice President.THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much, Steve. And again, we're going to work quickly. Its a great bill. We're going to have -- I really believe we're going to have tremendous support. Im already seeing the support -- not only in this room, Im seeing it from everybody. And Im seeing it from the public. And they want Obamacare over.I got elected to a certain extent -- I would say a pretty good little chunk -- based on the fact repeal and replace Obamacare. And many of you people are in the same boat. Very important. So lets get it done.Thank you all very much for being here. Thank you. Okay, thank you. END3:41 P.M.

Trump met with Congressman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) in the Oval Office to discuss rising prescription drug prices.

President Trump expressed his desire to work with Congressman Cummings in a bipartisan fashion to ensure prescription drug prices are more affordable for all Americans, especially those who need lifesaving prescription medications. Reforming the Food and Drug Administration and reducing the regulatory burdens on drug manufacturers so as to enhance competition will help accomplish those goals.

America remains committed to empowering women around the world to realize their full potential within the global marketplace. And with our international partners, America will build upon the legacy of previous generations of women who have bravely broken through both economic and political barriers.It was with these goals in mind that, as one of its first initiatives, this Administration ramped up efforts to promote women in business by launching the United States-Canada Council for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders.

The Easter Egg Roll will take place Monday, April 17, 2017, on the South Lawn of the White House. Families with children 13 years old and younger are invited to join the President, First Lady, White House staff, and their families for a day of festivities.The White House Easter Egg Roll is a timeless White House tradition, dating back to 1878 and the presidency of President Rutherford B. Hayes. The President and First Lady are honored to continue the traditions of the past, while weaving new traditions into the fabric of our Nation's history.White House Easter Egg Roll tickets are free to the public and will be allotted through an online lottery. Tickets are limited and non-transferable.Further information, including the specific timing of the lottery, will be released later this month.",20855.73,-69.02999999999884,5837.55,3.619999999999891,2362.98,-5.4099999999998545
291,2017-03-08,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:37 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Good morning. First off, I want to acknowledge, as the President did this morning, that today is International Womens Day. It's also Womens History Month. We're going to be holding several events throughout the month here at the White House to honor and celebrate women and how their vital contributions have and continue to be to our society, our economy, our family and our businesses.The President tweeted this morning about the surge in hiring in the two months that hes been in office. LinkedIns workforce reports say January and February were the strongest consecutive months for hiring in over a year and a half. A new report from ADP and Moodys showed strong private job growth that is far exceeding market expectations. And just this morning, Samsung confirmed that its planning a major investment in U.S. production facilities, directly citing the Presidents election as an influence in their decision. The initial investment is expected to reach around $300 million.We keep seeing that the wave of optimism in growth in the wake of the Presidents pledges to help American businesses continues to produce real results for people throughout our nation.Yesterday I forgot to -- there are a couple of things that I didnt get to yesterday, so let me mention a couple of those. Yesterday afternoon, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin, and senior White House staff met with several veteran service organizations -- included in what is commonly referred to as the Big Six -- to discuss the Presidents commitment to helping our veterans and modernizing our VA. The meeting represented another step in fulfilling the Presidents promise to the men and women who have served our nation so honorably. I know the President looks forward to personally following up on that meeting with the VSOs.Also last night, the President named several individuals whom he intends to nominate or appoint to key administration posts: Courtney Simmons Elwood, General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency; Noel Francisco, Solicitor General at the Department of Justice; Jeffrey Rosen, Deputy Secretary of Transportation; John J. Sullivan, General Counsel for the Department of Defense; Ajit Pai, member of the Federal Communications Commission; and Tony Sayegh, Jr., the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the Department of Treasury.Expect further announcements as the week goes on.Now, on to the events of the day. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Laurene Powell Jobs, the founder and president of Emerson Collective, an organization dedicated to removing the barriers that unfortunately prevent some in the world from achieving their full potential. They discussed education and immigration policy, which are two of the areas that Emerson Collective focuses on.Then the President held a strategic affairs lunch, focused on infrastructure with leaders in the private sector. Infrastructure used to be a point of American pride. But now, an overbearing, ineffective regular system can keep projects in limbo for years. The President has already started removing the regulatory roadblocks that have been killing projects before theyve even begun through his executive actions, streamlining the permitting process and calling for each agency throughout the government to identify regulations that cause undue burden.As the President has said many times, strong public-private partnerships will also be key to revitalizing our countrys ruined roads, crumbling bridges and outdated airports. The government has wasted too much of the taxpayers money on inefficient and misguided projects. By looking at infrastructure from a businesspersons perspective, as the President and these executives do, we can restore respect for the taxpayer dollar and make the best investment.The President was particularly pleased to be holding this meeting now that Secretary of Transportation Chao, EPA Administrator Pruitt, and Energy Secretary Perry are all confirmed and getting to work. In attendance at the lunch, as I mentioned, were Secretary Chao, Secretary Perry, Administrator Pruitt, and then Richard LeFrak, CEO of LeFrak; Steve Roth, the CEO of Vornado Realty Trust; Josh Harris, co-founder of Apollo Global Management; Bill Ford, the CEO of General Atlantic; Lynn Scarlett, the managing director of the Nature Conservancy; Tyler Duvall, the partner of McKinsey; and Elon Musk of SpaceX.Later this afternoon, the President will meet with Congressman Elijah Cummings to discuss rising prescription drugs prices. I know the President is looking forward to continuing the dialogue that they started a few weeks ago on the phone. At 4:00 oclock, the President will meet with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Senator Murkowski, and Senator Sullivan of Alaska. Theyre expected to discuss the priorities of the Department of Interior, especially as it pertains to the government-owned lands in Alaska. This evening, the President will meet with conservative leaders about health care. We'll have more details and participants on that meeting a little bit later this afternoon.The President and the Vice President continue to reiterate their support for the House bill on Obamacare repeal and replace, and look forward to working with Congress to institute a new healthcare system. Tonight, the President will have dinner with Senator and Mrs. Cruz.And finally, a couple of additional administration announcements. Today, the President and the First Lady announced the initial details for the 139th White House Easter Egg Roll taking place on Monday, April 17th. They are honored to continue the traditions of the past while creating new ones that will play a lasting role in the fabric of our nation's history. Tickets to the Easter Egg Roll are free to the public and will be allotted through an online lottery. Further details on the lottery and information on that day will be released later this month. Keep an eye on WhiteHouse.gov for updates on that.I'm also pleased to announce -- and a little bit proud -- that Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland will be visiting the White House for the traditional St. Patrick's Day visit on March 16th. We'll have further details on that visit, as well as the other foreign leader visits later this week.With that, some questions.David Smith of The Guardian.Q  Hi, Sean. Can I ask about the President's state visit to the UK? Is there timing for that? And what was your reaction to some members of Parliament in Britain saying the President is not welcome? They actually used words like ""racist"" and ""sexist."" Has that led him to reconsider?MR. SPICER: The President, as you know, accepted Her Majesty's invitation when the Prime Minister was here. He looks forward to going over and visiting the United Kingdom. As we have details to share with you further, we will, but there is nothing further at this time.Caitlin.Q  Does the White House have a reaction to the Iranian vessels coming within 150 yards of a Navy ship over the weekend? Aren't they on notice? And will you offer anything beyond a verbal reaction? And then I have a follow-up question.MR. SPICER: Okay. The USNS ship that was in close proximity is obviously something that the President has been made aware of. The President has been very clear that this provocative action is something that won't be tolerated. With that, I would refer you to the Department of Defense, who is monitoring that situation and will talk about the appropriate actions they may take.And your next one?Q  And then, secondly, does he have any plans to revamp the H-1B visa program by the April 1 deadline?MR. SPICER: I think we've talked before about immigration as a whole. I think there is the legal part of immigration and then the illegal part of immigration. The President's actions that he's taken in terms of his executive order and other revamping of immigration policy have focused on our border security, keeping our country safe, our people safe. And then, obviously, whether it's H-1B visas or the other one -- spousal visas -- other areas of student visas, I think there is a natural desire to have a full look at -- a comprehensive look at that. He discussed the RAYS Act yesterday with Senators Perdue and Cotton. We'll have more on that coming forward.But I think as the readout mentioned, he was very supportive of their efforts with respect to how we view legal immigration. He mentioned it in his joint address that we're one of only a handful of countries that doesn't use a merit-based system of immigration, and that is something that we need to look at in its totality.Hunter.Q  Thank you, Sean. I had two quick questions. Are you aware of any women who work at the White House who are participating in the strikes today? And also, more generally, what is the administrations reaction to this protest? And do you think its an effective way -- skipping work is an effective way for women to demonstrate their power and significance?MR. SPICER: On the first part, I am not aware of any that are not here. I think everyone that Im aware of has shown up and is working really hard to advance the Presidents agenda. Theyre committed to moving this country forward. For those of us who have joined the President throughout government, I think -- but obviously, as the President stated today, we want to recognize the contributions that women make to our businesses, to our families, to our economy, to our society. And its a free country. People have the right to express themselves. But I think that we should, on a daily basis -- not just one day a year but 365 days a year -- appreciate the contributions that women make in all of those categories. So it shouldnt be a daily thing, and hopefully we can help fix that a little bit more.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. There seems to be this groundswell of conservative opposition to the healthcare bill that was offered up by leadership in the House of Representatives. You mentioned the President is going to be meeting this evening with conservatives. What is his message to those individuals? Are they members of the Freedom Caucus? Will Senator Rand Paul be there? And can you give a sense about what the President intends to do to turn around that opposition that was quite apparent yesterday?MR. SPICER: So a few things on that. One, as I mentioned, well have a list of participants later. Two, I think that there has been a lot of -- from business and conservative groups have been very supportive of this, whether its Americans for Tax Reform, Americans Taxpayers Union, the Medical Device Manufacturing Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, AdvaMed, One Nation Health, Consumer Health Products Association, the Association of -- AMAC, the National Association of Wholesale Distributors, the American Legislative Exchange Council, and others.Theres been tremendous support for this. Weve had people throughout Washington, D.C going to different associations and groups throughout the day the last couple days talking about the benefits of this. And were going to continue to do outreach. He met, as you know, yesterday with the House Whip team expressing his unwavering support for the bill and the process that its about to encounter. Hell mention -- hell work with these individuals tonight.And were going to have a full-court press. Our team throughout the administration on local radio and local television to get that message right to the American people to talk about both the things that we talked about yesterday -- why we have a crisis right now in healthcare and why Obamacare is failing, but then secondly why the solution that the President has worked on with the House is the right one to bring down costs and to reinstitute choice. So that message is going to continue to get delivered both today and for the next several weeks until it passes the House and the Senate and comes back to his desk. But again, one of the important messages that I think those on the conservative side need to understand is, right now, there is an uneven playing field. If you get your insurance through Medicaid, Medicare, through the government, or an employer-based healthcare, you are untaxed, your employer is untaxed. It is those self-employed individuals, those small businesses that are paying the penalty for this.And thats what I think we have to remember, is that we talk so often on the conservative side and on the Republican side about the importance of entrepreneurship, the importance of small businesses to our economy, and yet theyre the ones who suffer right now with an inequity in the tax system. And I think that by leveling that playing field, and by giving them more options and driving down cost, were actually doing a very conservative thing here by removing the mandate of a government-mandated you must buy this program or you will pay a penalty, and eliminating choice.We are enacting I think very strong conservative values in healthcare that give all Americans more choice at a lower cost. So I think that should be a very positive message. John.Q  Yes, thank you. As a brand new federal employee I'm sure you're aware --MR. SPICER: A current -- welcome back.Q  Yes, well, at the moment. Im sure you and your family are aware that Office of Personnel Management offers a very comprehensive healthcare program called the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program.MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  You, anyone in this building, on the Hill, their staff, their family, their friends -- not their friends, their family -- well, maybe who knows -- very generous. Its state of the art. The individuals involved in the healthcare situation right now, the debate, no matter how it plays out, can they really have the kind of sympathy and empathy for individuals who may not benefit nearly as much when theyre negotiating this -- all these plans, Sean?MR. SPICER: In what respect?Q  Well, I mean, youre fine. Youre covered.MR. SPICER: Sure, but its unfortunate -- first of all, Im not fine. Because I think because of Obamacare, premiums on everybody have gone up. Regardless of what you pay, federal employees make a contribution to their healthcare plan as well. And I think that the -- all premiums have increased over the last -- whether youre in an employer-based system or not. So one of the big issues with Obamacare was in order to fix a problem that faced 15 to 20 million people, is that the entire system got shattered, and prices on everybody got ratcheted up. People who were on Medicaid suddenly lost their ability -- so the issue was, is that in an attempt to solve a problem that affected a very specified and defined group of people, we affected the entire healthcare market.So whether or not you get it from an employee or not -- an employer or not -- but to your question, thats part of the issue. Q  But --MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. Heres the issue -- youre right, youre absolutely right. Right now, if youre a federal employee, and a lot of cases in state, you get to open a book and you get to look at what plan matters to you, what plan is best for you or your family -- how much do you want to pay, how much coverage do you want to have, whats the co-pay youre willing to -- what services or benefits do you want as part of your plan. Absolutely. But the issue is, for so many Americans, they dont have that choice. For a third of the counties in this country, theyve got one choice, one. And in a lot of states theyve got none, or the exchanges are becoming fewer and fewer, the number of doctors and plans that take Medicaid, fewer and fewer.So to your point, I think actually were in a unique place, because we get to understand what the average American should get -- that we shouldnt be limited to a specified number of people.Q  I appreciate your argument. Very well taken. MR. SPICER: Thank you.Q  However, Im going to compare a GS-5 or a GS-9 to a senator or a secretary of one of the agencies. I mean the safety net on those individuals gives them a certain cushion, then they're negotiating. But do they really have that kind of compassion or that kind of empathy for the people who, in fact, may be thrown off the healthcare?MR. SPICER: I think that just because somebody has healthcare doesn't mean that they can't empathize with somebody who doesn't. We all have family and friends that are suffering. I mean, that's like saying because I have a job I can't be empathetic to somebody who doesn't have a job. We all have family or friends. Its the same thing when we watch a friend or a family member suffer through a terminal disease, because we have suffered through it doesn't mean that we can't have compassion towards that person or be concerned on how much that bill is costing them. I mean, that's actually in some ways -- depending on the relationship you have with that person -- you can even feel worse. You can feel guilty about how much you have and how you're not able to help that person. I think in many cases that's what drives us is to know that there are options available to some Americans and not others. Q  I appreciate your response.MR. SPICER: Thank you.John.Q  Sean, will you confirm that there is a criminal investigation into this alleged theft of cyber tools from the CIA by WikiLeaks? What can the White House tell us about the situation, particularly the fact that it seems like theres another leak for the intelligence community that's on the scale of Edward Snowden? And can you assure the American people that none of these tools have ever been used against them?MR. SPICER: Well, theres a couple things in that. Number one, for obvious reasons it is our policy as a government not to confirm the authenticity of any kind of disclosure or hack. That would be highly inappropriate for us.But all of these occurred under the last administration -- that is important. All of these alleged issues. And I think its interesting to have it asked this way about the damage that could have occurred or what tools could be used in light of whats been going on recently. We've had your own networks correspondent James Rosen had his phones -- multiple phones tapped. Was that appropriate back then?I think theres a lot of concern out there about alleged leaks. Theres two steps to this. And I think what you saw over the last week in terms of -- this should be a major concern to people in terms of the leaks that are coming out and the desire to get to the bottom of them -- whether or not -- not specifically with respect to the disclosure that you're referring to, but I think the idea that we are having these ongoing disclosures of national security and classified information should be something that everybody is outraged by in this country. This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our country, our security, and our well-being.And you've seen over the last two years, depending on the leak, it depends on the outrage. Its interesting how whenever -- whether the leak occurred under the last administration, you had member after member talking about disclosures that occurred during that last administration, whether it was members of Congress -- Elijah Cummings expressed concern during the last thing -- last administration in terms of the Americans that were -- when it dealt with Hillary Clinton, there was complete outrage about the leaks that occurred; members calling for investigations to the leaks. Its interesting how there is sort of a double standard with when the leaks occur, how much outrage there is.And so I do think its important. While I don't want to get into confirming or denying this particular thing, I think it is interesting how different subjects are approached.This one everyone is immediately rushing to, and there should be a lot more coverage of this. This alleged leak should concern every single American in terms of the impact it has on our national security.Q  Can I ask something unrelated?MR. SPICER: Of course, you can.Q  Robin Shahini has been imprisoned in Iran since last October for collaborating with a hostile government -- that government being the United States of America. He's on a hunger strike, apparently his health is suffering. Is the President aware of Mr. Shahini's plight and that of three other Americans who are being held in Iran? And what, if anything, might the President be doing about it?MR. SPICER: Yeah, so obviously we're aware of the situation. In that particular case, I would refer you to the State Department. Q  I wanted to go back to an earlier question. What is the President personally going to be doing in order to sell this healthcare bill? And what's he going to do to convince reticent lawmakers to come along -- people like Rand Paul, who don't like it?MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, we're on day two. As I mentioned, we've been out and local -- talk radio and local markets. The President yesterday met with the House deputy whips. Today, he's having a series of additional meetings with conservative groups, with others. He's already talked to insurance agents. I mean, we've talked about the lead up to this with the insurance executives, with companies, with various members of the House and the Senate from both parties. He met with governors, attorneys general, I think there's a group of lieutenant governors coming in. We're going to be aggressively going after -- talking about the solution that we have for healthcare, both the need to repeal the current Obamacare system and the need to replace it with something that gives patients the choices and costs that they need. As I mentioned yesterday, and I can't overstate this, there's a difference between having a card and having care. Being told you have coverage and not being able to use it is no good, and that's the thing that I think is really important. When we get asked the question, so often, how many people are going to be covered, that's not the question that should be asked -- how many people are going to get the care they need? Having coverage with a high deductible and, in some cases -- or not having a plan that allows you to get the coverage you need or afford it, isn't real coverage. It's a card. And I think that's the big difference in the approach that we're taking here. It's how do we get people the affordable care they need; that there's more choice; that more doctors are coming into the system instead of leaving. And that is a big, big difference in the approach that's happening now.Q  Will he be going on the road to try to sell it?MR. SPICER: I think you will see a lot of travel and a lot of activity by the President and all of the administration. And it's not just going to be the President. It's going to be the secretary, the directors, key administration staff. The Vice President has been actively engaged in meeting on the Hill, on talk radio, on local radio, on local television. You've seen a flurry of meetings with outside interests, with op-eds explaining the problem and engaging groups and associations that have an interest in this, and industry leaders.But this is going to be a very, very aggressive, comprehensive approach to making sure that every American understands that there is a major problem and that we are here to fix it.Cecilia.Q  Just on WikiLeaks, I want to go back to that -- two parts. Is the President outraged by this?MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, again, I don't want to -- the allegations -- he has been very clear about the concern that he has for leaks. This is --Q  This one specifically --MR. SPICER: Well, again, Cecilia, if I -- I think he is very concerned about the allegations that are out there in terms of what may or may not happen. It is an allegation, it is something that we are not going to confirm at this time. But as you can imagine from the President's previous comments, he is extremely concerned about this, about these allegations, about this -- about the potential that something -- if this were true -- would have on our national security. And make no mistake about it, I think the President has talked before that anybody who leaks classified information will be held to the highest degree of law. We will go after people who leak classified information. We will prosecute them to the full extent of the law. Playing with our nation's national security is not something that should be taken lightly under this administration.Q  Quick follow-up. When it came to the campaign and Hillary Clinton, the President said, ""I love WikiLeaks."" Does he still feel that way today?MR. SPICER: There is a big difference between disclosing Podesta -- John Podesta's gmail accounts about a back and forth, and his undermining of Hillary Clinton, and his thoughts on her on a personal nature, and the leaking of classified information. There is a massive, massive difference between those two things. And I think it is, again, the interest and the outrage that occurred last year by a lot of Democrats when it came to leaks is interesting that we're hearing not as much outrage now when it comes to some of our issues of national security.April.Q  Sean, a couple questions. One, you said Congressman Cummings -- you affirmed Congressman Cummings is meeting with President Trump today.MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  In the last press conference, his solo press conference the President had, he talked about Senator Schumer telling Elijah Cummings not to come. What happened to smooth this over? And what is the conversation going to be about? Is it just going to solely be on the high cost of prescription drugs?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that the nature of the meeting stems from the conversation they had on the phone, which was on prescription drugs. And then Im sure that if Congressman Cummings or the President brings up another subject, it will go there. Im not -- well try to have some sort of readout afterwards, depending on how that goes.But the nature of it is an area where they agree. And if you remember, one of the things that they talked about on the phone was that there were probably several more areas that they would agree on, and find that they would agree on, throughout a conversation. And I hope that that conversation does exactly what they said that it would in terms of getting to those areas of common agreement where they can work together to help solve additional problems that our country faces.Q  So you don't have any knowledge of what happened to smooth that over for him to come in --MR. SPICER: I know our teams were in touch with -- his office immediately followed. And as you know, there were a couple times when the meetings had been -- tried to be scheduled and just didn't work out. And luckily, he was able to --Q  Hes one member of the 49 of the CBC. Right after that press conference, the White House reached out to the Congressional Black Caucus, to Cedric Richmond, the head of the caucus. Where is that meeting? Where does that meeting land? Is it happening?MR. SPICER: I know that we've reached out, and we're looking for a date on that, as well. So we're pleased that this one was able to come together, and then well get to the next one.Q  My last question.MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Yesterday there was a compare-and-contrast with visuals, show and tell if you will --MR. SPICER: Yes, I saw that --Q  Yes, you were -- yes. And you compared and contrasted about how you're going about it and how the Obama administration went about Obamacare. One difference that they've made note of -- and I want to get your response to this -- is the fact that you may have this and said that you're doing this versus what they're doing -- the one thing they say that you did not do that they did: had their bill scored by CBO. And you did not score it by CBO.MR. SPICER: Sure. It is being scored. Look, I know -- look, with all due respect to them, this the same group that said -- who passed it and then told us we could read it.This bill is online for every American to go to ReadTheBill.gop. Its on the Speakers website. We link to it on several accounts that we've tweeted.Q  But it was scored before they went before the Congress.MR. SPICER: I understand that. And again, if that's the complaint, this is the same group that didn't let anybody read it, that jammed it through with no bipartisan support. This President has reached out to both sides of the aisle, had governors here, had senators here to get their input. There is no contrast between what we did and what they did. This was a full effort to reach out to the members in the House and the Senate. Its going through regular order in the House. Every member of the House and the Senate will be able to have their opportunity to have amendments offered through -- well, through the committee process and on the floor.So the idea that they can compare the date that they got it scored is pretty reaching deep on this because there has been an opportunity for members to have their input on this and to talk about their concerns, to give their input on it -- especially the governors, who were left on the sideline last time and who have such an important role in administering healthcare when it comes to Medicaid. The idea that anyone talks about when the score was issued -- there will be a score in all good time. But the other thing is, lets be honest, the irony of the score is that the CBO was way off the last time. I don't think that we're waiting to -- that that's a big issue to us right now.Q  Doesn't cost matter, though, before you --MR. SPICER: Of course, cost matters. But look at how off they were last time. If you're looking at the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place. They were way, way off last time in every aspect of how they scored and projected Obamacare in terms of -- Q  But you have no numbers --MR. SPICER: But neither did they. Last time, if you look at the number of people that they projected would be on Obamacare, they are off by millions. So the idea that we're waiting for a score -- it will be scored. But the idea that that's any kind of authority based on the track record that occurred last time is a little far-fetched.Jessica.Q  Two questions on the wall, Sean. As you know, the bids for prototypes went out today. And I just was curious about the timing of that, how much pressure there was to get that going quickly. And then secondly, is there guidance from the White House about what kinds of vendors can build the wall, especially can international vendors build the wall?MR. SPICER: I think that process is working through -- as the President has talked about before, we were trying to move ahead with existing funds that DHS has. And then well continue to create a timeline to ask Congress for that funding. We're working with Congress on that.And then I don't think it will be any surprise to know that the President is going to favor American workers and American companies when it comes to an American project. That shouldnt be any kind of surprise.Blake.Q  Sean, its looking increasing likely that the Federal Reserve next week will hike interest rates. Two brief questions. One, how does the President feel about that? And secondly, does he have the full confidence in Janet Yellen, who he described during the campaign as too political to lead the Federal Reserve and set monetary policy?MR. SPICER: Let me get back to you on that one. I don't have any comment on the Federal Reserve. Ill look at the team. What I will say is that, as I mentioned at the outset, when you look at the hiring and the jobs and the manufacturing and the pace, the consumer confidence and the CEO indexes that are going -- that have already come out in the first two months, we see a resurgence, an optimism in the economy by job creators to want to hire here, who want to manufacture here, who want to grow here. And I think that our economy is clearly on the upswing. And I think you see statement after statement, company after company coming out and sharing in the Presidents vision for moving the country forward and for renewing the optimism and building and being part of an American resurgence in terms of our economy.Q  Just to be clear, the no comment was on Mrs. Yellen or on this thoughts of a rate hike?MR. SPICER: Ill get back to you on both. How is that?Yeah, go ahead.Q  Sean, along with Aprils last question about the difference between this administration and the previous one and how to approach this issue, one thing that the Obama administration did do was get key stakeholders at the table -- AARP, American Medical Association. Both of those organizations have come out today strongly opposed to this proposal. Whats your message, particularly with respect to the AARP?MR. SPICER: Well, they got a really good deal last time when it came to prescription drugs in particular. I think -- this is a patient-centric bill. Its about patients. Its about people. Its about the Americans who were left behind. Look at what those deals got people last time. I mean, for all those people that are on Medicaid, in particular, they don't have choices anymore. So I would argue that the President has put the American people first and has put patients first. So you can talk about -- we're glad to have support, make no mistake about it. But I think that the support that this administration and I think the House is focused on is getting every American their buy-in and their support. Obviously, look, Im not going to -- we would love to have every group on board. But this isnt going to be -- every single deal we heard about it getting through, the Cornhusker Kickback, this and that. Over and over again, it was one deal after another to get to -- to buy votes to get it through the Senate.So if you want line up how many special interests got paid off last time versus now, theyll probably win hands down.Q  Sean --MR. SPICER: This isnt -- hold on -- but this isnt about trying to figure out how many special interests in Washington we can get paid off. Its about making sure that patients get the best deal that lowers prices and brings back costs.But again, I think -- what Im trying to figure out is at some point you're defending the indefensible. Nancy Pelosi put out three criteria for how they judge Obamacare. And by their own standards, they fail on all three. Costs are up. Choices are down. There is no other way to judge that. By every account, every single premium by every standard is up. Choices are down across the country. So there is a horrible deal that the American people got bought -- got sold. And what we're trying to do is put patients back first in line. Q  But so the AARP is specifically talking about patients in their 50s and 60s. The AARP describes this as an age tax that will disproportionately affect people who right now are low-income, are benefitting from subsidies under Obamacare and could stand -- according to the AARPs estimate -- to take a hit of thousands of dollars in their premium payments this year when the subsidies go away and the tax credits go away. Whats your message to those people who voted for the President?MR. SPICER: I think that -- right. And the message from the President is that we want you to get more choice and a lower cost. And I think that, as we work this bill through, through daylight -- not jam it through in the middle of the night -- that they are going to see as more and more people will that this is a deal for the American people that's going to put patients first, lower their costs, and give them more choices.But again, I don't -- there is probably not a person out there, either through themselves or a loved one or a friend or a colleague that has seen choices go down and premiums go up [sic]. So what people are dealing with now is not acceptable. And I think the idea that anyone defending the current status quo -- and even in some of the statements of some of the groups, they admit that theres a problem right now.And so my advice to those people is, join the process. Share your idea, share your thought, let the process work its will so that it is a bill that has input. But the bill -- the way it was done last time is not something thats acceptable.Shannon.Q  Is the President worried, though, that every major doctors group -- the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians -- have all come out and said they have serious concerns? For all the talk of doctors and patients and choice, the doctors groups are all so far unanimously coming and saying theyre not supportive of this. Is that concerning to the President?MR. SPICER: No, I think when you look at a lot of doctors versus the associations here in Washington, we have had tremendous input from doctors themselves. Dr. Price, himself a doctor, is the one who crafted this.So you have a doctor in charge of the administrations effort to work with Congress. Youve got several physicians and other medical professionals in Congress that are talking about the experiences they have -- in fact, many of them ran for Congress because of the concerns they saw in their own industry.So while I have respect for some of the work that some of these Washington, D.C.-based associations do, at the end of the day this is about patients and about the input from doctors who are on the front line of seeing patients and talking about the care that theyre able to give or not to give to people.Anita. Q  Do you mind if I follow up on something else you said?MR. SPICER: I do -- I dont, sorry. Q  Youve talked about people having a card. Youve got a card, but its a $2,000 deductible and theres only 10 doctors in your town that will see you, lets say. But thats better than nothing if you get cancer or hit by a car. So maybe this makes access -- right, but it is better than no insurance. So if this expands access to people and choice, but it reduces the number of people who actually have health insurance --MR. SPICER: But I dont think --Q  -- so can it do both?MR. SPICER: Yeah, of course it can. And it will do both, by ensuring that more people -- right now youve got more people paying the penalty and saying, I dont want healthcare, Im going to pay the penalty because costs are too high. And was it probably five, six, seven years ago, before Obamacare went into place, a single individual, young individual person on the open market could get a premium -- a plan with a premium of 100, 150 bucks a month. Its in the high 300s now.And I think that theres a big difference. Youre not -- for young people just entering the workplace, for example, your example -- they go get into an accident, right now youve got a lot of individuals that get off their parents healthcare and say, Im healthy, I have no desire to go get healthcare, its another few hundred dollars a month that I dont have or that Id rather spend on something else.If we can get that cost down, it makes a lot more sense -- and get them plans that are tailored to them, 27-, 28-year-old individuals dont need care thats for folks -- that talks about certain things that -- a plan that has certain things that are towards the end of life. But right now, youve got one-size-fits-all, government-run, government-mandated plans that offer people a suite of medical services that they do not need, because theres no choice, and its a government-mandated system.I think offering more choice and more competition allows people to pick a plan that is more tailored to your needs. And this goes back a second ago to what John was asking, that if you can actually pick a plan and across state lines find one that suits you as an individual -- as opposed to maybe theres a family plan thats more comprehensive, it has dental and vision and all the things that your kids are going to need because of all the things you anticipate -- thats a plan that a young family might need versus an older person thats single or a young person thats just entering the workforce.But right now theres no competition, theres no choice. So its not an either/or situation. Were facing a situation where more and more people are getting less and less and paying more and more for it, and thats the wrong way to go. Mara.Q  Anita. You actually -- Anita.MR. SPICER: My apologies. Anita, then Mara. Q  Switching gears completely, the military have recently conducted some kind of exercise at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, and it was preparing for a migrant crisis. And there is a DHS migrant center there. And I wondered if the administration has considered, and what you all think about using that facility for immigrants. Has that come up?MR. SPICER: That particular exercise, to the best of my knowledge, is a rather regular exercise that occurs, as do many of the exercises that the military prepares for on a whole host of contingency operations. So that is a routine military operation.Q  Is there any consideration, though?MR. SPICER: It is a routine military operation, as several of them do with our partners throughout the world where we plan for random contingencies that may or may not happen. Thats the job of the military -- to practice for contingencies that may or may not happen on a whole host of issues.But to try to ascertain --Q  Okay, so are you all considering using the facility for immigrants?MR. SPICER: There is nothing to consider it for. I think were fine right now. There is nothing that we would need to use it for.But again, I mean, I think part of the goal of preparing the military going through various exercises is on a whole host of issues -- on refugees, they prepare for natural disasters. Were not anticipating a natural disaster, but we prepare for them. At the White House, when we were coming in as an administration, I think we briefed during the transition period -- we did whats called a right-seat, left-seat operation with the outgoing administration. So we sat down and talked about cyberattacks and natural disasters, and the whole-of-government response in some of these things.It doesnt mean that we anticipate them, it doesnt mean that we want them, it means that were going to prepare for them in the same way that many organizations do fire drills. Its not that you anticipate or expect a fire, but you prepare for them, as many families do. Preparedness is the key to executing well, and I think thats what all were doing.Q  And secondarily, the Louisville media is reporting that President Trump will be there on Saturday. Can you confirm that? And is this about healthcare? As you just said, he was going to make the rounds.MR. SPICER: Yeah, Ive seen that report. We have nothing to announce with respect to the Presidents schedule at this time. But, as I mentioned earlier to I think it was Shannon, that we will have -- or is it Jill, I cant -- somewhere in this area -- we will have an update on the Presidents schedule later this week.But I do anticipate the President to be very active in his support for the repeal-and-replace effort. And so this is what you should expect.Now Mara.Q  The CBO score is supposed to come out next week, and you just called into question their credibility.MR. SPICER: I didnt call into question -- just so were clear, Im just --Q  It's true.MR. SPICER: Thanks, Matt, I appreciate it, I can answer. Their record is what Im calling into question to -- when you look at the number of people and the costs on what they scored, the last Obamacare bill on, its way off. Thats a fact, thats not anything more than that.Q  Well, people base their votes on what they think is going to happen to the cost and the coverage -- if they lose coverage.MR. SPICER: Thats right.Q  Is there any analytic organization that you would accept a score from?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that theres -- yeah, I mean OMB will probably put out a score on --Q  If not the CBO, is there some organization -- so OMB is the --MR. SPICER: No, no, Im not saying -- but, Mara, hold on. All Im saying is, look at what the CBOs record is on Obamacare. Its vastly off. I think they projected 20 million people to be on Obamacare this year; I believe the number is 12. Theyre way off in terms of the millions.So its not a question of whether Im questioning anything -- anyone that can actually do basic math can understand that their projections for Obamacare the last time were way, way off the mark. And so my only point is, is that I think when they come out with this score, we need to understand the track record when it comes to healthcare.Q  -- the track record? Is there any scoring organization that you think has a good track record?MR. SPICER: Theres probably a lot. And I think members have to look at a lot of things to cast their vote on. Theyre going to have to look at the totality of the bill, the support of their constituents, the current state of things. I think that theres no question -- look, when you look at the trajectory of the cost right now in terms of premiums, you can either say -- and not just the premiums, but Obamacare is going to collapse on its own weight very soon. And the President made it very clear in his press conference and a lot of previous statements, the politically easy thing to do is just let it collapse and let Democrats come back to the table.I dont think thats the right thing, and the President has made it clear he doesnt think thats the right thing. This is an opportunity for him to show the American people that the right thing to do is to care about their healthcare options and the cost that theyre paying.Q  And just one last thing. He mentioned deductibles before and how theyre going up under Obamacare. Are you promising people that their deductibles will come down under this plan?MR. SPICER: Everything that we have been led to believe about how this is -- yes, this will drive costs down. When you talk about opening up pooling, when you talk about driving costs down because you can buy it over state lines, everything that has driven up costs, all of those market forces that will come in, and I think every leading economist that has looked at this says it will drive costs down.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. The premier argument by Democrats, notably former President Obama today, is that enactment of the act that was illustrated yesterday would lead to many people losing their healthcare. You certainly heard that from Democrats, but also several of the Republican governors who were here for the National Governors Association, including strong allies of the President -- Governor Bentley of Alabama, Governor Hutchinson of Arkansas voiced the same concern. They did not want any plan that would lead to anyone losing their present healthcare. What does the administration say to what is the leading argument against a new plan? And then I have a follow-up question.MR. SPICER: Of course. I would say that any governor that is concerned about people losing care right now should join us. They are losing their care right now, they are losing their options, and they are paying too much. So the answer is that, if youre concerned about those principles, then you should be concerned with what is happening right now, and you should be concerned and want to join in this administration and work with this Congress.And again, the big difference thats here is, instead of us jamming a bill down Congress, and now allowing the American people to read it until it is passed, as was done with Obamacare with then-Speaker Pelosi, is that this bill is out in the open for every single person in the world to read. It is open for people to let their member of Congress share their thoughts, share their ideas, and its done out in the open.I think that is a vastly different approach with how this is going about than the last time, and that makes a big difference with the approach. And it gives people an opportunity through the process, what they call regular order, to have input on this. And if it can be made better, then great.But I think this time, we recognized that theres a lot of work that needs to get done on behalf of the patients that are having trouble getting care.Alexis.Q  Oh, wait.MR. SPICER: Im sorry.Q  My follow-up question is a follow-up question about the wall. During the recent Governors Association meeting, Governor Graco Ramirez, who is the Chairman of Mexicos Association of Federated Governors, warned that continued discussion about the wall and the Presidents talk of building it might very well lead to the election of Mr. Lopez Obrador as the President of Mexico, and he is considered the most anti-American, most hostile-to-America of any of the candidates. Are there any concerns that come up in the discussion of the wall, namely the impact on Mexican politics?MR. SPICER: No. (Laughter.) That was pretty good. The Presidents number-one concern is the safety of our country. Number two is the jobs that are impacted by this and the ability of Americans to get the wage that they deserve.But again, this is a national security issue, something that, frankly, when hes discussed this with President Pea Nieto of Mexico, that -- there is a shared concern about drug cartels, drug trafficking, arms sales over the border. There is a shared concern for the respect of the border, because it means a lot to both sides.So this is something that we care about from a national security standpoint, and then obviously the President is concerned on it both -- as well as on an economic standpoint.Alexis.Q  I want to follow up on what John was just -- your answer was that if the healthcare bill could be made better, the President is interested in that. So could I just clarify, when he meets with the congressional conservatives this evening who have misgivings about the legislation, is he intending to talk to them about what they would like to change, and is he open to making those changes? Is that what he -- is that the mode hes in, rather than a sell mode? Hes in a listening mode?MR. SPICER: I think hes in a -- very much of a sell mode. The President and his team have worked very hard on this. Theyre very proud of the effort and the product that they have produced in consultation with the House and the Senate.But obviously, its going through the process. And so if somebody has an idea -- and that could be on the administrations side -- that we believe that after a consultation with individuals or groups, that theres a way to improve upon this -- but thats the beauty of going through the process that we are.But make no mistake, the President is very proud of the product that we have produced. We are out in full sell mode all around the country talking about how we think this is the best way to solve the problem that the American people face, and why we believe that the solutions that we put forward in this bill are the right ones, and that will benefit them.Go ahead.Q  And can I follow up and say -- before the President meets with Chancellor Merkel next week, is it possible that we could see the President for a more general multi-question news conference? Hes been a little press-shy this week. And from North Korea to healthcare selling to CIA leaks, wed love to talk to him. Could we see him for a news conference?MR. SPICER: I will ask, Alexis. (Laughter.) Q  Would you ask him that? (Laughter.)MR. SPICER: Is there anyone else? I would be glad to ask -- show of hands. (Laughter.) Okay, thank you, I appreciate it. I would be glad to ask the President, share your request with him, and Ill see what we can do on his schedule. But as you can -- he is very busy these days. He has done a lot of sprays, he will continue to interact with you guys. But I will be glad to make your request known.Katie.Q  Sean, yesterday Secretary Price said that the bill that you guys have introduced, both the repeal and the replace, are starting points. And on Capitol Hill there was a lot of talk of the starting point being a nonstarter. So it seems like theres negotiations that need to be made. Does the President have any non-negotiables in his bill that he will not take out, even at the request of conservatives?MR. SPICER: Well, Katie, I mean, I think, as I was just saying to Alexis, that it is a starting point. Its going through regular order in the House. And so part of that process as it goes through the committee markup hearing, both in Ways and Means and House Energy and Commerce Committee -- that by its very nature allows for input through both of those committees and then ultimately on the floor before it moves over to the Senate, and the Senate goes through a similar process.So I think, frankly, were just acknowledging the reality of where the process is. But were proud of the process, were proud of the input that weve received from governors, from senators, from individuals, associations, companies. And we feel very proud of the work that is encapsulated in this bill, and the results that it will yield.And so that being said, I think the President understands, as a businessman, that if someones got a really good idea that hes going to listen to it. And if he can be part of the process to help make something better, theres nothing thats going to preclude that. We have been very open to listening to people. Were very proud of that. Were going to go out, as I said, in full sell mode. But if theres an idea that comes across, were going to entertain that to make it clear. Hallie.Q  Sean, two topics here. First on healthcare, then Ill have a follow-up on that. In the past, you and others have accused Democrats of rushing through the original healthcare law. Now, there are some Republicans, including today, who say this is simply moving too fast. Is the President willing to accept a delayed timeline if it pushes repeal and replace into later in the year?MR. SPICER: Going through the process cant be delayed -- I mean, by its very nature. Were going through the committee process. There are two House committees --Q  But you said the timeline is being -- maybe Easter break -- after that --MR. SPICER: But again, thats subject -- right, but again, I would argue its subject to how the House does its will and then how the Senate does. I think obviously we would like this to move forward. Theres a lot of stuff in the queue. Weve talked about tax reform. This bill is attached to the FY17 budget reconciliation, and I know that, for a lot of Americans, that means nothing in terms of the phrase and the nomenclature that surrounds how Congress does it.But its important to recognize that that vehicle allows Congress to do certain things and not others with a 50-vote -- with a majority vote in the Senate. Thats important. There are certain things you can do through that, that you cant do through other vehicles, and that will take a 60 vote and -- that you can do administratively.So its actually -- if you heard Dr. Price talk yesterday about the three phases, its actually multi-phased, its going through regular order. But there is simply no contrast between how we are approaching this and how Democrats approached it last time.Number one, theres actually been input from across the aisle, both from the governors who were here, attorneys general, outside groups, House and Senate Democrats have been able to provide input to both staff, to the senior administration officials and to the President. And then secondly, its actually going through the process. So while we can predict a timeline, ultimately, its going to be up to the House and then the Senate to determine how fast it goes. But there are members on each of those committees, and then, ultimately, every member on the floor that has the ability to give input.Q  Just one other question. Im just curious about this meeting with Senator Cruz tonight. He has come out and expressed some skepticism on the bill as it stands now. Presumably that will be part of the topic of conversation, but as you mentioned, Heidi Cruz is coming too, and Im wondering if the President has any plans to apologize to her for the insinuations he made on the campaign trail. MR. SPICER: I think theyre looking forward to a great dinner. He had dinner with the Rubios a couple of days ago, maybe a week ago. He had lunch yesterday with Senator Graham. As I stated weeks ago, the President is going to continue to have outreach to members of Congress of both parties. Hes meeting with Congressman Cummings today. This is a President who wants to engage with members of both sides of the aisle in both Houses, but also groups, business leaders, union leaders, the AFL-CIO head, Richard Trumka, was here yesterday. This is a President thats going to engage with everybody that can help join in proposing ideas and thoughts and opinions on how to move the country forward.So he looks forward to dinner tonight with Senator and Mrs. Cruz, as he has with several others. And I think youre going to see more -- a continuation of this kind of effort to reach out and get peoples ideas. Margaret.Q  And then -- I apologize, I have a second topic, which is, does the President believe the CIA has been compromised in any way? MR. SPICER: With respect to the disclosure, is that what youre --Q  yeah.MR. SPICER: Again, Im not going to -- its U.S. government policy not to confirm this. I think he has obviously been very concerned, as I stated, about the disclosure of national security on any level. It undermines our countrys national security. And I think that -- I just will say, I think theres also been a big double standard when it comes to disclosures of classified information and the outrage that exists when one side has it happens versus another.Q  What do you mean?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that there has been a lot of disclosures about national security that occurred last cycle when there was potential that the FBI had leaked certain information. The members of Congress on the other side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton, and others talked about how there was so much concern about classified information -- were seeing such silence and outrage from the media, from others with the current disclosures now with things that may or may not have happened towards the 2016 election when it comes to this side.So I think theres a vast difference when it comes to how the disclosures are approached. Yeah.Q  Sean, on North Korea, what is President Trumps position toward North Korea, and what is his decision for the North Korean policy?MR. SPICER: On the which --Q  North Korean policy.MR. SPICER: On the politics?Q  No, policy. Q  Policies.MR. SPICER: Oh, policies. Well, I mean, were very troubled by the launch of missiles that have occurred from North Korea. I think thats why the THAAD missile system that weve started to deploy into South Korea is so important. Were continuing to work with the government of South Korea to make sure that they have the defenses necessary to protect themselves.The deployment of a THAAD system is critical to their protection, as witnessed by this weekends ballistic missile test. China and the United States in particular both understand the threat that North Korea poses to the region. And I think that theres areas of concern that we can work together to protect the country.Trey.Q  You had called on me.Q  Today was International Womens Day. Theres a lot of concern about access to healthcare for women. Will the President commit to reaching out to female Democratic lawmakers as the next two phases of this healthcare bill continue? And additionally, what is the Presidents stance on access to birth control for women across the country?MR. SPICER: I think that question was asked and answered by Secretary Price yesterday. With respect to womens health, the President has also made it clear that he intends to have a substantial increase in funding towards women community centers that fund womens health services. And that will be reflected in his budget. Margaret.Q  Thank you.MR. SPICER: Sorry.Q  Sean, is the President the target of a counter-intelligence investigation?MR. SPICER: I think thats what we need to find out. Theres obviously a lot of concern. I mean, I mentioned to John there was considerable concern last cycle when a reporter was the target of one. But part of the reason that we have asked the House and the Senate to look into this is because of that.And I think it was interesting. I think if you look at last week, all of a sudden these stories that keep coming out about the President and his links to Russia, it has continued to be the same old, same old, played over and over again. The President has made clear he has no interest in Russia, and yet a lot of these stories that come out with respect to that are, frankly, fake. They are a series of fake allegations that at the bottom note, While theres no evidence to substantiate any of this, its the same unnamed sources, associates that we get tagged with, and yet there is no evidence that continues to be shown. And every single person that gets briefed on this shows that -- whether its Senator Cotton, Chairman Nunes, who has done a phenomenal job of trying to get to the bottom of this.But its interesting, I think the double standard that exists between the concern about getting to the bottom of the allegations that -- with respect to the President, that there are so many other issues. When you talk about --Q  So he doesnt know whether he is the target of a probing?MR. SPICER: But I think thats one of the issues that we have asked the Senate and House to look into. I can tell you with respect to the other instances, you look at former DNI Clappers comments, he literally said, the DNI -- he said, The DNI, which includes the NSA, FBI and CIA, did not find any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian agents. Senators Rubio, Cotton, Burr, Chairman Nunes -- all of the people who have been briefed on this situation have come to the same conclusion.And it is interesting how many times this fake narrative gets repeated over and over and over again, and yet no evidence has ever been suggested that shows the President has anything to do with any of the things that are written. Its a recycled story over and over and over again. And I think that theres a bit of -- its amazing, the President goes out last week, does this joint session, and then literally 24 hours, stories start getting recycled about potential issues that come up that literally continue to offer no fact, nothing but the unsubstantiated rumors over and over again. And yet, what is ignored is when you have someone like former DNI Clapper go out and literally say that they did not find any evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and [Russian] agents. You have Rubio, Cotton, Nunes all say the same thing that theyve been briefed that theres nothing -- and yet this fake narrative --Q  Sorry, just want to make sure that Im understanding you. Are you saying that there is a possibility he is the target of a counter-intelligence probe involving Russia? Because you just connected those two things.MR. SPICER: No, no, no. I think what Im saying is that there is a difference between that narrative and then the narrative that has been perpetuated over and over again.The concern that the President has and why he asked the Senate and House intelligence committees to look into this is to get to the bottom of what may or may not have occurred during the 2016 election. But the interesting -- Margaret, is that when you look at every single person thats been briefed, theyve all come to the same conclusion -- that nothing happened during the 2016 election tying him to Russia. And yet the fake narrative continues over and over and over again, and the idea that it has to -- it continues to be recycled without any substance, without any evidence, needs to stop.Yes.Q  The President said he was tapped.Q  He said his wires were tapped.Q  He said this as a fact.MR. SPICER: I understand that, and thats why were --Q  So youre saying he doesnt know whether he was wiretapped?MR. SPICER: No, no, no, thats not what I said was --Q  Well, he doesn't know he's the target of an investigation. Q  That his wires were tapped.MR. SPICER: Hold on, one at a time. I said that the President made clear on Sunday that he has asked the House and the Senate intelligence committees to use their resources and their processes to examine the facts and come to a conclusion.Chris.Q  Since youre talking about whether things are true or not, let me ask you -- following up on something yesterday, you seemed to acknowledge that the President was wrong when he tweeted that 122 prisoners released by the Obama administration from Gitmo had returned to the battlefield. In fact, it was mostly by the Bush administration. Will he retract, or even apologize for that, given that he also called it a terrible decision by the Obama administration, and given that that was incorrect? That there still has been no proof either of his tweets about widespread voter fraud or the wiretapping? Does the President have a credibility problem?MR. SPICER: No, look, I said yesterday -- I think Trey asked the question -- that the President meant the total number of people. Q  But he said the Obama administration.MR. SPICER: I understand that, Im actually explaining it. Thats why you asked the question. He meant that the total number of people released from Gitmo was 122. What the President -- but just to be clear, theres a big difference -- under the Bush administration, most of those were court ordered. The Obama administration took great steps -- they talked about -- it was a campaign promise, frankly, from day one to close Gitmo. This President is very clear that he understands the nature of the threat that the people in Gitmo pose to our nation, and the recidivism rate that there are among people that we have released.That is a concern that he shares. The reason the Bush administration did it was in many cases they were under court order. The Obama administration made it actually a priority to let people go and to actively desire to close that camp and to release more and more of those people, especially in the waning days. There is a huge contrast between the posture and the policy of the last two administrations on how they were dealing with Gitmo.This administration understands and the President has been very clear that he understands the people that are kept in Gitmo pose a danger to our country and to the rest of the world. Theres a big, big difference between the posture of those two.Q  Do you acknowledge that the tweet was wrong?MR. SPICER: I just said it. I said that the tweet -- he meant that it was -- the totality of the people. Thats what I said to Trey yesterday, Ill say it again to you today.Dave Boyer.Q  So can I just follow up on something else you said, Sean? A totally different topic, because you said that youre in full -- youre in sell mode, completely in sell mode. And I wonder if the President sees this as a test of his ability to make a deal, something that he really talked about, something that voters responded to on the campaign trail. Is this essentially, does he feel, on him that this is him going to show the American people that he can get this deal done?MR. SPICER: Well, he gets -- he is a dealmaker. Hes a negotiator. Hes a world-class business leader. And hes been highly successful at it. So if anybody can get a deal on something, its going to be Donald Trump. Thats part of the reason I think that the American people -- what they saw in him, that there was so much broken with Washington that when it came to the big problems -- whether it was domestically or internationally -- that if somebody could come in and work across party lines, work with another country to get a deal that was in the countrys best interest, he had that skillset. And thats why they, frankly, elected him President. So I think he feels very good about the product that weve put out. We are in sell mode. We want to get this done. But the President has an open mind. He enjoys meeting with people and hearing ideas about how to make this country better, how to create jobs, how to create a better healthcare system, how to create better schools. And if theres someone that comes up with a better idea that will help lower costs and increase access, hes certainly going to listen to it.Dave Boyer.Q  Sean, yesterday in the Presidents meeting with the deputy whips he was talking about his tax cut plan. He said its going to be the biggest since Ronald Reagan, maybe even bigger. He said, I know exactly what were looking at, most of us know exactly the plan. So my first question is really easy. Tell us about the plan.MR. SPICER: What the plan is?Q  The tax cut plan.MR. SPICER: Well, again, Im going to wait until -- thank you, I appreciate the layup, Dave. (Laughter.) But Ill leave it to him to work with Congress. When were ready to roll it out, we will do just that. Were not there yet, so lets go on with the next hopefully --Q  Secondly, building on these jobs numbers today that look very positive, obviously theres a lot of CEOs out there who are excited about the possibility of a tax cut plan, and yet the President has also expressed a lot of concern about the national debt. If youre going to get a tax cut on the level of Ronald Reagan, a historic-sized tax cut, how are you going to do that, balance the needs for continued job growth with the concerns about the debt?MR. SPICER: Because I think that one of the best ways to get the national debt down is to grow the economy. The more the economy is growing, the more we can get it at three, four, five percent, the more the deficit goes down. Thats just the best way to tackle the deficit is to grow the economy, put people back to work, create a deeper manufacturing base. I mean, that is -- between that and some of the efforts that the President has put in to make government more efficient and effective, and save money at that level, those are the two things that I think combine to get the deficit down.Jennifer.MR. SPICER: Hi, Sean. Of the more than 13,000 Syrian refugees who are in this country, less than 150 of them are Christian, Shia, or Yazidis -- the same groups that the U.S. government acknowledges are literally being at risk of being wiped off the map. So I wonder, now that Secretary Tillerson has had time to settle in and as you review the refugee program, immigration policy, is this something thats being discussed? Is this a priority to give these groups some relief?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that you know that when we talked the first time about the executive order, it was something that we acknowledged. There is definitely an area where -- in the executive order that we just passed, one of the areas that we talked about was -- and Id have to go back and look at the exact phraseology, but we recognize that certain groups, and they can be religious in nature, are being persecuted, and I think that thats going to be a factor on how we look at that program. Its something that the President, as you mentioned, hes talked about in the past. Its something that Secretary Tillerson has acknowledged. And thats not just refugees coming into this country, but I think one of the reasons that we need safe havens in Syria is to make sure that groups and individuals, whether they be part of a group or religion who are being persecuted have a degree of safety that they can count on.Q  Thanks, Sean. Appreciate it --MR. SPICER: No, no.Q  Mike, Maria.Q  Right here, thank you.MR. SPICER: Its International Womens Day, Mike.Q  Exactly. Thank you so much. So the President is on the record saying that he supports some sort of legalization for many of the undocumented people in the country. And you know theres a DREAMer that was caught in the raids in Seattle, Washington. We dont know if he is going to be released or not. Does the President want to or plan to meet with DREAMers to talk about whats on his mind about gathering ideas for some sort of legalization? And if so, when would that meeting occur?MR. SPICER: The President, I think, has talked about how he wants to tackle this holistically, and back to Chriss question a second ago, I think he has made clear that if theres someone who has the ability to strike a deal, to get people in a room and acknowledge well, we have to stay true to our principles, that we can get a deal on a way to fix our broken immigration problem, it is him.We are not at that phase yet. This is something that he has talked to senators about, and I think that, as we continue to move forward, obviously, the focus now is on Obamacare, repealing and replacing it with this program. But it is something that were going to continue to move forward with, and as a comprehensive thing -- not just the illegal issue, but the visa issue, how we deal with the other folks that are in this country. But stay tuned, weve got more to go on this. Well go further.Whats that?Q  No meeting on the works with DREAMers?MR. SPICER: There is nothing on the schedule at this point.Q  I'm sure you're aware of reports that the President had ordered the Pentagon to step up the attacks on al Qaeda in Yemen. Does this mark a new strategy rather? And does the President delegate now to the Pentagon attacks on either ISIS or al Qaeda?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the President talked about this a lot during the campaign, about giving the authority and trusting the generals and the decision-makers of his national security team with executing what they need to, to prosecute the war on terror and the war against radical Islamic terrorism.So its not a question of delegating authority. There are certain things -- and we addressed this in the briefing in previous weeks -- but theres a big difference. Hes not delegating the authority, but making sure that they have the ability and the timeliness to act in an appropriate manner to prosecute the case and to go after terrorists in a way that they probably werent last time.So I mean, there is a big difference between the approach of this President and the last administration in terms of giving the generals and the leaders in the national security team and the Defense Department the tools and authority they need to prosecute the case against ISIS.Sarah. Gabby, sorry.Q  Thanks, Sean. Youll get it one day.MR. SPICER: I know. You guys switch.Q  Israels defense minister said yesterday that U.S. officials had sent a direct warning to Prime Minister Netanyahu against annexing parts of the West Bank. I wanted to know if that was at the request of President Trump. And then also, if you could tell us where the White House is in terms of reaching a deal with Israel on what they consider permissible settlement construction.MR. SPICER: Well, as you know, yesterday, the President spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu. That conversation largely had to deal with areas of regional security. I dont have anything further to readout on that, and I know that when they met here at the White House, there was discussion of settlements, and the President was very clear about what his desires and his wishes were. I think as we continue to follow up with Israel in the coming weeks, we will have more on that.Q  Thank you. Ronica Cleary with Fox 5. I have a follow-up question to actually his asking about the thousands of women who have chosen to strike today, and you saying that it is a free country. But at Channel 5, weve reported quite a bit on the schools and the districts that are closing because so many women chose to strike today.So it is a free country, but what would be the Presidents reaction to, if you will, what is more important; the students being at school today or the womans right to strike and kind of make a statement, if you will, on this day?MR. SPICER: Yeah, thanks, Ronica. I think its an important question. I mean, youve -- I know, locally, this affects a lot of individuals throughout Northern Virginia and Maryland and the District. So look, I think -- I havent talked to the President specifically about this. Obviously, as I mentioned, people have a right to express themselves under our First Amendment, as the President is doing today by making sure that we appropriately salute the contributions that women make to this country. But theres clearly an impact in the case of schools -- localities throughout the country, here in the greater Washington, D.C. area. But I think that that concern is best utilized by parents through their local school boards and through their city councils and mayors, whether or not they found it appropriate for that to occur. I have not spoken to the President about this, but I think theres a balance. And I think that -- I would hope that we should use this opportunity to recognize the role of women in the workplace, in the family, and throughout society for the contributions that they continue to make and have made in the past in making the country as great as it has.So with that, one last thing, just to clarify. I think Jill asked this, but I just want to be really clear on one point, which is, there is no reason that we should -- that we have to think that the President is the target of any investigation whatsoever. Im sorry, that was Margaret. I apologize.Q  Specifically counterintelligence.MR. SPICER: Right, and there is no reason to believe that he is the target of any investigation. I think thats a very important point to make, and so --Q  So retract your previous --MR. SPICER: No, no, no. It doesnt -- what Im saying is -- hold on. The one question dealt with whether or not the tweet dealt with wiretaps during the thing, the other is an investigation. They are two separate issues, and there is no reason to believe that there is any type of investigation with respect to the Department of Justice.Thank you, guys. Ill see you tomorrow. Thank you. See you guys --Q  -- leaks?MR. SPICER: Not that -- I cant comment. Thank you, guys.END2:50 P.M. EST",20855.73,-69.02999999999884,5837.55,3.619999999999891,2362.98,-5.4099999999998545

293,2017-03-09,Remarks by President Trump in National Economic Council Listening Session with CEOs of Small and Community Banks,"Roosevelt Room11:17 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you, everybody, very much. Good morning and I greatly appreciate you being here. We have some real experts with us and we have some great bankers with us.Today's discussion is crucial to my jobs agenda and to the American people. Community banks play a vital role in helping create jobs by providing approximately half of all loans to small businesses, and that's been dwindling because the community banks have been in big trouble.Nearly half of all private-sector workers are employed by small businesses. We must ensure access to capital. Small businesses -- small businesses to grow. Community banks are the backbone of small business in America. We are going to preserve our community banks.You probably know this -- I signed an executive order on regulation on February 3rd, I believe it was. And that's a big executive order, a very powerful executive order. It's taking a lot of the regulation away. You'll be able to loan. You'll be able to be safe. But you'll be able to provide the jobs that we want and also create great businesses.So it's an honor to have you with us today, and perhaps we could go around the room. And we'll start with Dorothy, and say who you are and who you represent.Go ahead, Dorothy.MS. SAVARESE: Thank you, Mr. President. I'm Dorothy Savarese.

294,2017-03-09,Readout of President Donald J. Trump’s National Economic Council Listening Session,"Today President Donald J. Trump hosted a National Economic Council listening session in the Roosevelt Room of the White House with community bankers from around the country.The President and the community bankersalong with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohndiscussed how excessive regulation is threatening the future of community banking in America. President Trump noted that community banks are crucial to our Nations economy, particularly because they provide approximately half of all loans to small businessesthe engines of economic growth and job creation in the United States.Current one-size-fits-all banking regulations have badly hurt Americas community banks.

295,2017-03-09,Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:04 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Good morning, everyone.Q  Afternoon.MR. SPICER: Thank you. Appreciate the -- John Roberts fact-checking from the seat. (Laughter.) Good morning -- good afternoon. (Laughter.) Its not my fault, its on the paper. After receiving his daily intelligence briefing this morning, the President led a National Economic Council listening session with CEOs of small and community banks. Since 2008, the number of small banks has declined 30 percent. The dramatic increase in regulation following the financial crisis has been a major driving force in the decline of these banks. Dodd-Frank alone has resulted in 22,000 pages of new regulations. While large banks can hire armies of compliance officers whose sole purpose it is to ensure they meet the ever-growing number of regulations, it increases the cost of doing business for community banks, leading some not to engage in some forms of lending, or simply due to the time and costs involved.Our community banks are key funding sources for small-business owners, entrepreneurs, farmers and ranchers across the country, many of whom cant qualify for traditional loans. They provide approximately half of all loans to small businesses. By reforming the regulatory system so that it is efficient, effective, and appropriately tailored, we will stop treating these critical institutions in our communities the same as banks that have exponentially more in assets, enabling them to engage even more with small businesses and entrepreneurs that stimulate local economies.The banks participating in this listening session are members of the American Bankers Association and the Independent Community Bankers of America. A full participant list is available to those who are interested.Yesterday I noted the continued signs of good news in our economy in terms of hiring, and the morning reports showed that consumer comfort has risen to the highest level in a decade. Im sure last night you also saw the report that illegal southwest border crossings are down by an extraordinary 40 percent, a significant deviation even when you consider the seasonal trends. These measures reflect that both the economy and the border are already responding to the Presidents agenda, even while were still in the beginning stages of putting his policies in place.The country and the world are clearly ready and waiting for the change that the President campaigned on and is already delivering. Right now, the President is holding a legislative affairs lunch with OMB Director Mulvaney and key members of Congress on his plans for the federal budget and repeal and replace that weve talked about. This is just the latest opportunity to continue the dialogue between the President and members on Capitol Hill on turning his ambitious agenda into action. The strong relationship between President and congressional leaders will be key as the budget process moves along. As Director Mulvaney has been saying, our budget blueprint will be released in mid-March, and the President is working collaboratively with both his Cabinet and Congress to create a budget that keeps the Presidents promises to secure the country and make the most efficient use of taxpayer money.In attendance at the meeting from Capitol Hill are Senator Crapo, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Chairman Cochran; the Senate Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee; Senator Mike Enzi, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee; Senator Bob Corker of the Senate -- member of the Senate Budget Committee; Congresswoman Black, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee; Congressman Thornberry, the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee; Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio; Congressman Meadows of North Carolina; the Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus; and Congressman Rokita of Indiana.Later this afternoon, the President will meet with former Secretary of Commerce Pete Peterson. Then the President has a meeting with Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly and the Director of the CIA, Mike Pompeo.And finally, the President will make remarks to the Senate Youth Program around 4:00 today, a tradition that began with President Kennedy and has continued through every administration. The President is honored to be speaking to this distinguished group of young men and women who are interested in pursuing careers in public service.I also want to mention that right about now, the Vice President is giving the keynote remarks at the Latino Coalitions Policy Summit. His remarks focus on the particularly negative impact of Obamacare on small businesses, many of who have been unable to hire more workers, or were forced to scale down their operation due to high taxes and burdensome requirements that were imposed by the law. The President is dedicated to improving the healthcare system for every American, including small businesses owners who have especially been suffered -- have had to suffer through complying with thousands of pages of regulations and rules. Thats exactly why hes working with Congress to enact the American Health Care Act, which he was glad to wake up this morning and see approved by the House Ways and Means Committee. Also today, the President was pleased to see his Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, voted out of committee. We had hoped to see Seema Verma, who would be confirmed as the administrator this week as the administrator of Health Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services at the Department of Health and Human Services. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats continue to unnecessarily delay her confirmation. At this critical time when were talking about healthcare, its ironic that they refuse to consider someone with such amazing expertise in this area.Seema Burma has worked for over 20 years in healthcare policy. She has redesigned Medicaid programs in several states, including Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and Kentucky. Shes worked with governors offices, state Medicaid agencies, state health departments, state departments of insurance, as well as private companies and foundations. Shes unquestionably and uniquely qualified for her position, and especially now that health reform is at the top of the Presidents agenda, its time to get her in place. This delay by Senate Democrats at this critical time is unacceptable.On a scheduling note for the weekend, the Vice President announced yesterday that hell be in Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday with Governor Bevin. The Vice Presidents Office will have further details for you on that trip as we get closer. Finally, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that today is the 10-year anniversary of the disappearance of Former FBI Agent Robert Levinson from Kish Island, Iran. The Trump administration remains unwavering in our commitment to locate Mr. Levinson and bring him home. The Levinson family has suffered far too long, and we will not rest until his case is resolved. And with that, Ill take your questions.Hallie Jackson.Q  I got a couple of topics for you, if you dont mind.MR. SPICER: Of course.Q  Julian Assange says the CIA has lost control of its entire cyber weapons arsenal. Does the President agree?MR. SPICER: I think, as weve commented before, theres grave concern that the President has about the release of national security and classified information that threatens and undermines our nations security. Obviously, he believes that the systems at the CIA are outdated and need to be updated. We are not commenting on the current situation, as is U.S. government policy, but I think the situation technology-wise at the CIA, the President has acknowledged, needs to be updated. The CIA put out a statement regarding the current situation, and I would refer you to that.Q  Follow-ups on that. Is he going to talk about that with Mike Pompeo today?MR. SPICER: He gets a daily briefing from the director, and Im not privy to the contents of his discussion, but obviously issues of national security, including that, are probably something that gets discussed.Q  And then some Republicans have said Julian Assange should be imprisoned. Does the President agree?MR. SPICER: I think the U.S. government has had a position on Julian Assange is -- a position in the past, and I dont see anything that has changed that. He has compromised in the past -- and undermined our national security, and I think Ill leave it up to the Department of Justice to further comment on their disposition of him.John.Q  Second topic was on healthcare.MR. SPICER: Second topics?Q  Second of two topics.MR. SPICER: Its like an interview, not a press briefing.Q  The President tweeted just a little bit ago that he believes that healthcare is coming along great. Weve also been watching Paul Ryan deliver a pretty lengthy PowerPoint presentation --MR. SPICER: Very good PowerPoint.Q  -- seeming aimed at convincing Republicans to get onboard this plan. Isnt that a sign that healthcare is not actually coming along great?MR. SPICER: I think anybody who has been in Washington for a few days or longer recognizes that any major piece of legislation takes a lot of explanation. The President has been very committed to talking to members of Congress. He had another meeting last night. Something as complicated as this, that deals with one-fifth of our economy, that was a major takeover of our healthcare system, isnt a simple thing. Its a major, complicated piece of legislation thats got three prongs to it. And this is the first one -- the reconciliation piece that starts to chip away at finally repealing Obamacare. When they passed Obamacare, they rushed it so quick they gave the then-Secretary of Health and Human Services great authority to enact certain aspects of it. We now -- that would be our phase two, is having Secretary Price go through the pieces of Obamacare that he has been given the authority to, when they passed it, to help unwind a lot of the things they did.And then phase three is stuff that has to be done through other pieces of legislation that does stuff like allow people to sell insurance across state lines; that allows small businesses to pool. So theres a lot of facets to getting this pushed through, and I think that one of the things that weve been able to do quite effectively is talk to members, especially in the House, but the Vice President has been very active on both sides of both chambers to communicate how this is a comprehensive strategy in three prongs to repeal and replace it with something more effective.Q  -- for example, roll back Medicaid expansion freezing until 2018? Would he support that?MR. SPICER: Look, Hallie, I think this is going to through the process of -- its working its way through Ways and Means today, theres a mark-up in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and I think thats where we are going to continue to see action -- in the House, and then when it goes to the Senate the President will continue to engage very actively with the House and the Senate to get this done.Q  Thank you, Sean. New York City First Lady Chirlane McCray said in a statement that Donald Trump should keep his hands off womens bodies, womens healthcare, and Planned Parenthood, which has done just fine without President Trumps advice. I wanted to know what the response from the White House was on this.MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, with respect to Planned Parenthood specifically, the President has been very clear that hes pro-life. Weve worked with them to talk about making sure that theres a difference between taxpayer funding of abortion and womens health services. We have, and the President has committed to making sure that funds for women health community centers is going to be reflected by a substantial increase in his budget. Hes committed to doing that, and hes trying to figure out a way to make sure that the focus of taxpayer money is spread towards community centers that provide vital health services to women, and that were not using taxpayer funds for abortion.John Roberts.Q  I just want to follow on Hallie --MR. SPICER: Which one?Q  In an unrelated topic. (Laughter.) Just so youre prepared. On healthcare, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas today sent a series of tweets in which he basically said, this is dead on arrival in the Senate, go back to the drawing board, adding that it is absurd for the committees to be voting on something that hasnt even been scored yet. What does the President think of what Senator Cotton said today? Does he plan on having a conversation with him?MR. SPICER: Well, were going to engage. He has talked to Senator Cotton, and will continue to talk to any senator that has questions or concerns or ideas. It went through the Ways and Means Committee last night. I think they started at something like 10:15 yesterday morning. It is an 18 --Q  Has he talked --MR. SPICER: I dont believe he has talked to Senator Cotton. Hes meeting with members right now. As I just mentioned, he had dinner last night with Senator Cruz. Hes continuing to work both sides of the aisle, both chambers. As I mentioned yesterday, I think youre going to see a very aggressive, a very robust push. We continue to have the team out talking to local media, local radio, op-eds placed, talking to local leaders. We believe that the more we talk about the comprehensive, three-prong approach that we have to doing a lot of the things that conservatives have talked about -- to bring back cost containment, to get people to be more patient-centered in the healthcare decisions they make, allow more choices -- its going to bring people on board.But the thing thats really interesting, John, about the current approach is that, no matter where you are, especially on the conservative side, you cannot possibly believe that the current healthcare system is an effective program. It is a monstrosity. It is a government gone wrong. And I think --Q  I hear that, but --MR. SPICER: And I think that we will continue to engage with him and other members of the House and Senate that have ideas, but its going to continue to work its way through the process. As I mentioned, it went through the House Ways and Means Committee. Its currently going through the House Energy and Commerce Committee. When the House passes it, and it goes over to the Senate, Im sure Senator Cotton and other senators will have an opportunity to have their say. Thats part of the process. We welcome his ideas and his thoughts, as we do with other senators.But the President has continued to do tremendous outreach, and our staff has continued to do that. Mick Mulvaney has been on the Hill, Vice President Pence has maintained a very aggressive schedule, as well as other members of the administration, and were going to get this thing passed with all of their input and ideas.Q  Was the President aware that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was acting as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be the national security advisor?MR. SPICER: I dont believe that that was known. I would refer you to General Flynn and the Department of Justice in terms of the filings that have been made.Q  Had the President have known that, would he have appointed him?MR. SPICER: I dont know, John. Thats a hypothetical that Im not prepared to ask. I dont know what he discussed prior to being appointed in terms of his background, his resume, his client base. I dont know any of that. I know that, from what I have read, that he has filed the appropriate forms with the Department of Justice, and I think you should ask him and subsequently them if you have any questions about this specific filing.Jon Karl.Q  Sean, just following up on Senator Cotton, he told me just a short while ago that he believes that this bill might actually make things worse than the current Obamacare. What do you say to Senator Cotton?MR. SPICER: I respectfully disagree, and I hope we have an opportunity for the team to continue to not only talk to him about what were trying to do and how were trying to do it, but that wed love to hear his ideas. I mean, this isnt -- as I mentioned the last couple days -- were not jamming this down peoples throat. Were welcoming ideas and thoughts. We think this is a great vehicle to restore a patient-centered healthcare bill to drive down costs, and I think Senator Cotton clearly recognizes that the current version of healthcare that is out there right now is not sustainable.And so we welcome his input into this process. We think that the work that weve done prior to putting this together with the House is something that reflects a lot of the best ideas, and we would continue to welcome his input on this.Q  Are you open to major changes --MR. SPICER: Hold on, Charlie. Its not -- Im not open --Q  Is the White House open to major changes or is it --MR. SPICER: I think the President has said before he wants to hear members ideas. He believes that this bill encompasses the best of ideas and the best way forward. But again, were going to let the process work its will through the House and then subsequently through Senate. And if members have ideas, we want to hear them and want them to be part of it. This isnt getting jammed through, and we welcome that, and thats why the President continues to meet with folks. He met with individuals yesterday. He going to go meet with them today. Hes going to be hitting the road. He wants to hear members of Congress, outside groups, physicians, healthcare providers, patients. But he wants people to have an input in this to make sure that we have the best possible bill that serves their needs and that dont look back, like we do now with Obamacare, and say, I wish was had done this right.Weve got a system that, frankly, isnt working. And I think that, no matter where you are on the political spectrum, you have got admit that either you or a loved one, or a friend, or a colleague isnt getting the care they deserve, or isnt paying what they thought they would be paying. And I think we have to do this right so that we dont look back the way we do now and regret the way that it was done.Charlie.Q  Senate and House conservatives said that they want sort of a return to a 2015 Obamacare repeal effort. If that effort landed on the Presidents desk, would he sign it?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the effort that is going through right now is the vehicle that is what people are on board with. I think one of the things that we have to remember is that the process, this three-pronged process, is done for a particular reason. The reconciliation process -- which I know for most people, it sounds like a very arcane, inside-baseball congressional term -- but it only allows for certain things to happen in that repeal process. And that's why we've been very clear -- and I think Paul Ryan laid out, Dr. Price has laid it out, and Mick Mulvaney is laying it out when he goes up to the Hill -- that there's a reason that we keep talking about it in three prongs. Because there are only so many things that you are legally allowed to do through the reconciliation process. When the Democrats jammed this through, they did it in a way that they did it basically in two steps. They jammed it through the reconciliation process, number one. And number two, they gave broad authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services so at the time -- that she could unilaterally do certain things with healthcare and implement certain things that we now have to undo in the same way.What we've done that's different, though, is frankly, add a third prong, which allows for additional legislative vehicles that will go through the House and then to the Senate, that will allow some of the core conservative principles that we've talked about for, frankly, decades, about allowing more competition, allowing people to pool, allowing people to do things that we think will allow lower prices to come out of the process. And I think that's a big difference in how --Q  So if a repeal lands on the President's desk, he would not sign it?MR. SPICER: It is going to land on his desk, because we're going to go through this process.Q  I mean repeal without replace.MR. SPICER: Well, again, I think the way that we're doing now I think is the right and the responsible way to do this. This bill will land on the President's desk. He will sign it. We will repeal Obamacare and we will put into place a system that will be patient-centered that will allow the American people to have greater choice and lower cost.Blake.Q  Sean, with the pushback that you're getting so far with healthcare, do you think it is realistic to have both healthcare and tax reform done in 2017? And I ask you that because Mitch McConnell was asked about this day, and he talked about there being certain constraints, and that the tax reform portion of it could be a 2018 item.MR. SPICER: I think we feel very confident that we're going to get a lot done -- continue to get a lot done this year. Tax reform is high on the President's priority list. I think it's high on the American people's priority list. And especially as April grows closer and closer, and people look down at their federal tax form and realize how much they're paying, and we see companies pledging to come back recognizing that these companies bought into the President's vision and agenda to make America more tax and regulatory friendly so that they would create jobs, manufacture more here. That's something that he's committed to.He understands how important it is. Look, the President is uniquely qualified as a businessman, a successful businessman, to understand what a good business climate does to job creation and to manufacturing. And I think his commitment isn't just a campaign promise; it's something that he has lived by for decades now, understanding that that's what spurs economic growth, that makes one place more attractive to invest in or to hire more people or to grow jobs. And so for him, this is deeply personal. And I think that you're going to see Secretary Mnuchin and others work on the contours of that in the next several weeks. But we intend to maintain to the schedule that he laid out.Q  The August portion is still the timeline?MR. SPICER: That's right.Eamon.Q  Thanks, Sean. On drug prices, Congressman Elijah Cummings was here yesterday. He said that the President was enthusiastic about his deal to cut drug prices. Is the President enthusiastic about that? And if he is, how much pain should drug companies be prepared to take here?MR. SPICER: (Laughter.) Ironic that you're talking about drug companies and pain. Maybe there's a pill for that.Q  Of course.MR. SPICER: Yeah. I think the President -- as you know, one of the reasons that he reached out to Elijah Cummings initially is because they share that and I think, frankly, yesterday came to a lot of other areas where I think that they can find common ground and work on issues. And I know that drug prices is something that he understands near and dear is helping many people get the care that they need, but the rising cost is something that is -- so I think as we look at the vehicle in terms of the specific legislation, they share a commitment to it. And I think that there will be continued follow-ups not just between Congressman Cummings but others as to what the best piece of legislation is and how we get that home.Q  The Democrats said that they're going to drop this bill in two weeks. Is the President prepared to push the Democrats on Capitol Hill?MR. SPICER: I don't -- I think that's a bigger conversation that we have to have with House leadership in terms of some -- maybe it is that right vehicle. Maybe Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy and Chairman Brady have other ways to achieve the same goal or work with Congressman Cummings. I don't want to be prescriptive to the House as to how they work their will, but I know that the President has a commitment to that topic and that he wants to work with Congressman Cummings and others who share that same commitment.John Gizzy.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean.MR. SPICER: John Gizzy.Q  Oh, Gizzy. (Laughter.)MR. SPICER: You're both good-looking Johns -- (laughter) -- but I'm going to -- I'll come back.Q  All right, thanks.Q  Thank you, Sean. Two questions. First, a Japanese news service is reporting this morning that the President will have a meeting with President Jinping of China in April. Does this mean that there is a new meeting before their scheduled meeting at the G20 in July?MR. SPICER: I'm not going to comment on the President's schedule or foreign leaders at this time, John. I think I've pretty much gotten that one down. So until I have something further for you, I'm just going to let you get on to your next question.Q  All right, thank you. Going back to the meeting and to your opening statement about the banks, in the last campaign, candidate Trump campaigned hard on restoring the Glass-Steagall Act, which would put a barrier between commercial and major investment banks. It, of course, was repealed in 1999 -- the repeal signed by President Clinton. Senator Sanders campaigned on this as well, noted that it was in the Republican platform in Cleveland, and said in December he'd be happy to work with the Trump administration on restoring Glass-Steagall. Is there any plans for the President to meet with Senator Sanders? And is repeal of Glass-Steagall on his agenda?MR. SPICER: There's no current schedule to meet with him. I'm sure that, as he has done with several other members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, that at some point, that will be scheduled. But we don't have anything on the books for now. But look, he's shown -- and I think today was another -- or yesterday was another example, today another example of his willingness to reach across the aisle, his willingness to look into both chambers and not just business but labor unions and other industries where we can find common ground. And I think if Senator Sanders and others want to work with the White House on areas of ways that we can improve the financial industry, we're going to do that.Q  Are you still committed to restoring Glass-Steagall?MR. SPICER: Yes.Erin.Q  On infrastructure, can you give a sense of timing, where it is on the priority list, and if these new reports that say that the infrastructure in the nation is in really bad shape, does that give it new urgency?MR. SPICER: I think the President mentioned it in the joint address. I think we're looking at a public partner private -- a public-private partnership as a funding mechanism. There is a lot of work being done behind the scenes. And I don't want to put a timeline on that. Obviously, as I just mentioned to Blake, we've got -- we're currently dealing with the repeal and replace of healthcare. I think we need to move on to tax reform. But that is definitely somewhere that is -- we're trying to figure out how to move that vehicle. There will be further discussion of that as we get closer to the budget as far as where that fits into the piece.John Decker.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. The President had this meeting last evening here at the White House with some conservative groups. Out of that meeting, can you tell us whether the President was successful in twisting arms, getting these conservative groups to back this particular healthcare bill? And just separately, I see on the President's campaign website that there is an event, a campaign-style rally planned in Nashville, Tennessee for next week. Can you confirm that? And why did you choose Nashville, Tennessee? There's a Democratic congressman that represents Nashville -- it's Jim Cooper. Are you hoping to get some Democrats behind this bill?MR. SPICER: So in the first part of that, you saw a lot of the statements that came out last night from some of the various groups. They were very encouraging. Their guiding principle is we want to get to yes.I think one of the things that's really interesting, and I addressed it earlier, is that there's a lot of members, a lot of interested parties, a lot of groups that haven't fully heard the three-prong approach. And I think Speaker Ryan did a phenomenal job today of really laying this out. Dr. Price has done a good job. That people need to understand the totality and the comprehensive nature of this; that there are three pieces of it. And I think what happens sometimes is that the reconciliation piece of this gets lost as defining the totality of it. And people need to understand the two other pieces that achieve many goals, that healthcare advocates and conservatives have fought for, for a long time that allow great competition, that allow small businesses to pool those resources together. But there's a lot of things that occur in phase two and phase three that help bring down cost and create greater choice. It's amazing when you listen in to some of these meetings how often people say, I didn't realize that, and I didn't understand the full scope and totality of what the plan was. It's very encouraging. And then I think they -- without getting into details -- I think in a lot of cases, they've shared some ideas with the President that we might be able to find some common ground on. So we'll take it one step at a time.Go ahead.Q  On the campaign-style rally?MR. SPICER: I would refer that question to the campaign. I think the President is going to be traveling next week. And then -- but there will be -- the details of that are listed on the campaign site. There is going to be I think additional travel announced for next week on the official side. And as we get closer to either the end of this week or the beginning of next week, I'll try to have more for you.Katie.Q  The President promised to immediately terminate DACA when he got in office. It's been nearly seven weeks tomorrow and he still hasn't done it. Can you definitively say if he's going to get rid of DACA? And if not, is he giving them legal status? And what's the plan for DREAMers?MR. SPICER: I think, Kaitlin, we've talked about the status of that and the -- and how many steps we have to go through on immigration. In the past, I think we've made significant headway in achieving the President's priorities of starting the wall, driving down illegal immigration. The numbers that came out last night show that even when seasonally adjusted, we see a 40 percent dip in the people crossing our Southern border. That's a very promising sign.That being said, the executive order, the second one -- there was a lot of effort put into making sure that that was rolled out effectively and achieved the goal of protecting the country that the President sought out to do initially. So we're continuing to take steps on immigration, both legal and illegal immigration. And as I've mentioned in the past, we'll have more as we go forward.Q  So he does still plan to get rid of DACA?MR. SPICER: I think the President has been very clear about how he plans to address immigration as a whole, both legal and illegal.Katie.Q  Sean, the President is convening with conservative groups, but there's also opposition on the left. Does he plan to -- he brought bipartisanship to Washington, finally. (Laughter.) Does the President plan to meet with groups like the AMA and AARP, which supported Obamacare but are not supporting this bill?MR. SPICER: I don't -- it would be ill-advised for me to start saying who he is going to -- but I think that what we've shown over the last couple weeks is the President's willingness to meet with individuals, senators, groups. So I don't want to rule in who is going to meet, or out, but I think that I've said before with respect to members, and I'd say it again with respect to groups, that I think if people have ideas that will help provide a more patient-centered healthcare system that drives down cost, the President and the team here will be willing to meet with them.So I don't want to be prescriptive in terms of telling them who they have to meet with. Their day is pretty busy right now with the Hill, but I will get back to you on some of the other groups that they're going to meet with and we'll go from there.Brian.Q  Thanks, Sean. Two quick questions. One, this morning at the National Press Club, a local business in D.C. filed a Superior Court of suit against the President in regarding Trump Hotel. And I don't expect you to speak to that issue specifically, but their feeling less that -- as much as this administration has supported small business, couldn't he divest himself from this and support small business in the district? First question.MR. SPICER: I'm really not sure -- how would he -- in terms of what?Q  Well, there's 25 small businesses, restaurants, in the area, and they're saying that the Trump Hotel is taking all that business away from them. And couldn't he walk away from it and help out the small business in the district?MR. SPICER: Well, as far as the President's -- obviously the President has made very clear in that December press conference at Trump Tower he doesn't have conflicts and he's done everything in accordance with the guidance that was given and gone well beyond what he ever needed to do. But obviously, you can't -- your name is on certain things and that's a very big difference in terms of some of the properties that he owns. But he understands the importance of small business. Thats why were meeting with community banks this morning to talk about the lending that they need -- whether its small business, entrepreneurs, farmers, ranchers throughout the country. He understands the role of small business in our economy and how many jobs they provide, and I think hes been a champion of it.Q  Second question was, in his speech before Congress last week, he said its not too much to dream that at some point in time our -- and Im paraphrasing -- our feet could be on foreign soil, and Im guessing other planets. With the NASA budget being released yesterday, I believe, is there a major initiative for this administration for space exploration? Or are we just talking dreams?MR. SPICER: Im going to let Director Mulvaney get into the details of the budget next week, or whenever that -- Im trying to remember the calendar here. But when the Director comes out hell talk about the specific funding levels.As you know, were in the middle of this what we call passback provision where weve sent them from top -- numbers. Theyre sending us back their recommendations and their observations and edits and questions with respect to their budget. So were going to take this one step at a time.Q  When he said --MR. SPICER: Obviously hes very keen on Americas role in space, and I dont want to get into specific budget priorities or numbers until were ready to release them. John.Q  You called on me.MR. SPICER: Im sorry, April.Q  Its very important. MR. SPICER: I know, I saw the hands. (Laughter.) Q  So, Sean, just really fast, following up on John, were seeing the campaign information for next week in Nashville. You said something about talk to the campaign -- whos the campaign?MR. SPICER: Ill try to help get you a name. There is a campaign infrastructure still in place. It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting on campaign activities from the podium.  So theres a website up, same one that was during the campaign, and I would suggest that you utilize that. But Im only here as an official in the government so I dont want to get into that.Q  Now, yesterday, going to back to Congressman Cummings, you talked about some other issues that they talked about in that meeting, where they found common ground. I want to hit two issues. The vote irregularities, voter fraud and voter suppression -- where does the President see this coming together. We heard from Congressman Cummings, but where does he see -- we understand hes saying that voter fraud is real when there are other people saying its not. But then there are factual documents and cases of voter suppression. So how is there a marrying of that in this Presidents eyes?MR. SPICER: I think thats why hes asked Vice President Pence to look into it. I would disagree with the ascertation of -- I think theres also factual evidence of people voting illegally. We saw that in Texas a couple weeks ago and in other places.So part of the reason that hes asked Vice President Pence to chair this task force is to look into the issue. But we welcome input in other areas, and its an area that theyll continue to discuss.Sara.Q  Im not done. HBCUs, HBCUs. Now, also, Congressman Cummings said that when he talked to the President and he brought up the issue of funding for HBCUs, President Trump said to Congressman Cummings that the President did not ask for money. Now, they came here, according to many of the presidents that Ive canvassed, they came here with the intent of -- the fact that they were going to get some money from this executive order. MR. SPICER: I dont think the executive order is the --Q  Thats what their belief was. But then what I understand is that there was talk about investment in these colleges from Steve Bannon. One president wrote this down saying that we are looking for a plan from you to invest in HBCUs and we will execute it when we get it. And theyre looking for full funding for Title 3, Pell grant full funding -- fall, spring and summer, -- as well as a one-time $25 billion investment. What does this White House think about this plan that theyre trying to give back to this White House, especially at a time when youre looking at cutting domestic spending?MR. SPICER: I think, when they were here, we were pleased to roll out the executive order that talked about making historically black colleges and universities a priority in this administration, moving that sort of point person into the White House so that we could coordinate a whole-of-government opportunities for -- we talked about this.Looking at the different educational opportunities -- expand government, whether its health or investment in sciences or even stuff like ROTC and NROTC programs that are some of these that span out of the Department of Defense. But weve got to look at how were providing government assistance in a whole host of ways to historically black colleges and universities.I think the issue of funding will be properly addressed in the budget, and at that time -- but obviously this is something that has been discussed. The President --Q  Is the Presidents request realistic? Is this funding realistic?MR. SPICER: April, Im not going to negotiate the budget from here, but I think that the President has been -- made very clear that the vital role that they play in our society. And I think hes shown that initially by the executive order that he unveiled, and we will have further information for you as we get closer to the budget.Sara.Q  Thanks, Sean. Circling back to what you said about critics characterizing the budget reconciliation bill as the entirety of repeal-replace, how quickly does the President want to see Republicans move on phase three, the companion legislation? Does he envision those unfolding simultaneously? And then given the early opposition to the budget reconciliation bill, does the President maybe want Republicans to recalibrate their strategy when it comes to that companion legislation?MR. SPICER: I am not going to start to tell Speaker Ryan or Leader McCarthy [sic] or the Whip, Mr. Scalise, how to release and when to release legislation. But I think obviously we need to make sure that members and all Americans understand the totality of this so -- at a schedule that they see fit. And Ill let them unveil that schedule that -- they talk about the totality of this plan and the comprehensive nature in all three prongs that make up the repeal and replace part of this. Its important I think, though, for people to understand that theres a commitment to do all those things that weve talked about -- whether its pooling or -- across state lines. Theres a lot of principles and things that weve discussed that I think are important to let people -- to know about.Q  Whats the assessment of the situation in Afghanistan? What is the assessment of the situation in Afghanistan, because there have been a series of terrorist attack there? And does the President have plans to send additional troops to Afghanistan?MR. SPICER: So on troops Id refer you to the Department of Defense on that one. I think we are in the middle of a comprehensive review on our policy in Afghanistan that -- working with our Afghan partners and the Department of Defense and our key military leaders to create an approach to address Afghanistan to defeat ISIS.So were in the middle of that process. When we have more well update you. But I think the Department of Defense is probably the best place to go to get that.Q  Thanks, Sean. Today, hundreds of U.S. Marines were deployed to Syria. So Im wondering how involved was the President in that decision-making process, and is this part of his wider anti-ISIS strategy?MR. SPICER: Obviously, the President was made aware of that. This is something that was done in consultation. He understands the regional issues that need to be addressed there, and, again, I would refer you back to the Department of Defense on that.Yeah.Q  Sean, thank you. I have a follow-up question to Hallies first set of questions on WikiLeaks. My question is --MR. SPICER: I feel like Hallie gets, like, eight questions --Q  The Republicans are calling for Julian Assange to be in jail or be arrested. What about the tech companies that he says that he will work with to give them these CIA hacking techniques? Should there be any legal repercussions for tech companies willing to sort of embrace and use this technology that youre taking a stance against, if you will?MR. SPICER: So, number one, Ill go back to the statement that we dont comment on validating or authenticating allegations of this sort as the U.S. government -- in terms of U.S. government policy. I will say that the President obviously feels deeply concerned about anybody, an individual or anybody, that seeks to undermine the national security of our country. I dont want to -- stay within my purview here, but I do think that I would check with the Department of Justice in particular about -- if a program or a piece of information is classified, it remains classified regardless of whether or not it is released into the public venue or not. And so I would just suggest that someone consult with them regarding the legal repercussions of any individual or entity using any piece of still-classified information or technique or product that hasnt been declassified. Theres a reason that we have classification levels, and thats to protect our country and our people. And thats something that we have to maintain, regardless of how its thought out.Zeke.Q  Sean, two questions for you. One, back to General Flynn, how concerning is it to the President and to the White House that a registered foreign agent was selected to become -- was the national security advisor for a brief period of time?MR. SPICER: Look, I think this is what he did for a living. And as the President said in the press conference, talking to individuals that are within the realm of the duties that youre going to perform is part of your job. Q  -- compensated for --MR. SPICER: I understand that but he was being compensated, he wasnt being compensated as part of the transition, as far as Im aware. And so he was a private citizen at the time. And when youre a private citizen, youre allowed to engage in legal activities.I dont have anything further on that, but I think theres nothing nefarious about doing anything thats legal as long as the proper paperwork is filed.Q  Sean, just real quick, it was just -- several reports out of the State Department from our colleagues that on Secretary Tillersons upcoming trip to Asia, he will not be taking any press with him on that trip. Thats a breach of precedent, certainly of the last several bipartisan administrations. Is it concerning to the White House that the administrations foreign policy might not be effectively communicated to the American public and around the world because there isnt a press pool with the Secretary of State?MR. SPICER: This is the first Im learning of it, Id be glad to follow up with you, Zeke. I dont know that. I think you all know that we have been a very transparent administration in terms of access to the President and his activities here. Id be glad to follow up with the Department of State and follow up -- that you can share that with your colleagues.Margaret.Q  Thanks, Sean. Yesterday you said the President had no reason to believe there was any type of investigation with respect to the Department of Justice. Did the Justice Department give you that assurance? Because theyre telling The New York Times they did not.MR. SPICER: Im not aware of it, but thats my point, is that were not aware of anything.Q  -- been told by the Justice Department that there is no investigation.MR. SPICER: No.Q  So there might be one, you just dont know. MR. SPICER: Right, I said Im not aware and were not aware. And thats why we want the House and the Senate to do what the President has asked of them, to look into this. But, no, were not aware.Q  To discover if there is an investigation.MR. SPICER: No, to look into the situation. Q  The Justice Department is saying, though, that they never gave you the assurances that you gave us. MR. SPICER: Okay. No, the assurance I gave you, Margaret, was that Im not aware. And that is 100 percent accurate.Q  So when you said, no reason to believe, it was, Im not aware if theres an investigation?MR. SPICER: Thats right. Right. I mean, I dont know that theyre not interchangeable. Im not aware. I dont believe -- look up in a thesaurus and find some other ways, but I dont know that theres a distinction there thats noteworthy. But were not aware, I dont believe, that that exists.Q  Whats that based on?MR. SPICER: Thats based on that Ive not been aware of. But thats the answer to that. When someone is asking me if Im made aware of something and the answer is no, then the answer is no.Q  But the question was whether he was the target of a counterintelligence probe.MR. SPICER: Right, and the answer is, were not aware. I dont know how much clearer we can be on this.Q  So its just that White House is not aware if the President is the target of a counterintelligence probe?MR. SPICER: Correct. Im not sure what were dancing around the same question.Q  Well, because I think yesterday, when you came out and corrected and clarified, people took that as a definitive answer that, in fact, that was not the case that you said --MR. SPICER: No, it means were not aware. I dont -- just that should be the definitive answer.Vivian.Q  Thank you. I have two questions, but a really quick follow-up to Zekes.MR. SPICER: So thats three.Q  Two and a half. (Laughter.) So can you elaborate a little bit on how and to what extent Michael Flynn was involved in shaping the current Turkey policy for President Trump? I mean, was he engaging with the Turkish leaders and --MR. SPICER: I dont have anything on that. You can contact the NSC on that. Im not aware.Q  Okay. So for my two real questions. First, is there any official response to the lawsuit in Hawaii over the revised travel ban?MR. SPICER: I think we feel very comfortable that the executive order that was crafted is consistent and were going to go forward on this. But I think, by all means, I dont want to -- we feel very confident with how that was crafted and the input that was given.Q  Okay. Thank you, and the second thing is Nigel Farage was at the Ecuadorian embassy in London today where Julian Assange happens to be staying. We dont know if they met or not, but was he there? I mean, hes a close ally of President Trump. Was he there in any official capacity?MR. SPICER: I dont keep his schedule.Q  Was he delivering a message? Do you know if there was contact on that?MR. SPICER: I have no idea. No. I have my own concerns here, keeping track of what everyone is doing. I generally dont worry about what is going on across the pond.Johnathon.Q  You already gave me one, but just to follow through. (Laughter.)Q  Ill take his.MR. SPICER: Wow, all right. Hey, hey.Q  But the question is not what, but Farage -- can you tell us he just wasnt there on behalf of the White House?MR. SPICER: Sure. I dont -- this is silly. I really dont think asking where random foreign leaders are and whether or not they are there -- Im sure he was there doing whatever on behalf of either the --Q  -- ally leaders --MR. SPICER: Hes a member of --Q  He had dinner with the President --MR. SPICER: Okay. I understand that, but I dont keep his schedule. Im not sure. Toulouse.Q  Two questions on two different topics. First, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sent a letter to Congress saying that Congress should raise the debt ceiling. We know that the Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney, when he was in Congress, he voted against raising the debt ceiling multiple times.So is Mulvaney going to support the raising of the debt ceiling and does the President support that? And is he going to push Congress to do that?MR. SPICER: I think weve got a few months to do that. I think the Secretary was making Congress very much aware. We got into -- have now been in the White House six weeks. Were approaching the 50th day here of this administration. I think we are trying to deal with the situation at hand. Part of the reason that the President has addressed a budget the way he has is to try to get our nations debt deficit and budget in order. I think hes continuing to show a tremendous respect for taxpayer money, the way we spend money and bring it down. But obviously, there are certain things that are a little beyond our control when we walked into this building, and were going to work with Secretary Mnuchin and Director Mulvaney to address this issue, and obviously work with Congress.Q  Second question on another Cabinet Secretary. Scott Pruitt said today that carbon dioxide was not a primary contributor to global warming. That obviously is at odds with global scientific consensus. Does the President agree that --MR. SPICER: I think -- thats a snippet of what Administrator Pruitt said. He went on and said, I dont think we know conclusively, this is what know. I would suggest that you touch base with the EPA on that. But thats -- he has a very lengthy response, and so that is just one snippet of what the administrator said at that.Anita.Q  Two things. One, I think you mentioned at the top but Im not sure, that apprehensions were down across the border. There was a question yesterday about the wall. Is the wall still needed if the apprehensions are down?MR. SPICER: I think so, sure. The President was very clear. Its not just needed, the President committed to doing it to the American people. And I think, while we can have a good month, and I think well see if that continues, that the President made a commitment to the American people to make sure that this isnt just an anomaly, and that, while they might be down, I think we have to do what we can to protect our country, both in terms of national security and economic security. So its of course still needed, and its a commitment that the President made, and I think one of the things that the American people, regardless of where they stand across the aisle, appreciate about this President is that he is a man that has kept his word. He talks -- he made commitments to them, and hes fulfilling them to make the country better.Goyal.Q  Sean, I said there was a second question.MR. SPICER: Im sorry, you did.Q  I think youve been asked this before but have been reluctant to say whether President Obama and President Trump have spoken since the inauguration, although President Trump was very forthcoming about that during the transition so Im not sure why you wouldnt mention it. But Im just asking that again. And there was a report yesterday that said aides for both Presidents have spoken. Can you talk to us about either of those things?MR. SPICER: Id be glad to follow up. Unfortunately I did not ask the President whether or not he spoke -- Ill be back tomorrow --Q  Can you follow up? Can you ask about the aides?MR. SPICER: Yes, I can. I will. I keep my word too.Goyal.Q  Okay, well --MR. SPICER: Stealing what -- all the way --Q  Its actually me. (Laughter.) Q  Lost your shot.MR. SPICER: Look at that.Q  Can you tell about policy now on Guantanamo, how it might have changed, where things are with that?MR. SPICER: Where what, please?Q  On Guantanamo, on whether Guantanamo will be expanded, whether detainees will be brought to Guantanamo, whether they will be transferred out. Just where things are.MR. SPICER: I dont have anything to announce with respect to its expansion or its use -- expansion use. I think the President has commented on the importance of Guantanamo and the need to maintain that the people who are there are not people who seek to do anyone good. Theyre there for a reason, and he has no plans to close it, if thats what youre asking.As far as the future use goes in terms of expansion, I dont have anything to comment on at this time.All the way in the back, yeah. You got it, Goyal.Q  All right, all right --MR. SPICER: No, no, Goyal. (Laughter.) You keep trying to steal his question. Q  Thank you, Sean. Two questions please.  One is that -- as far as the attacks on the Indian American communities across the nation, theyre not new, it happened in the past also. But the Indian American communities recently have been having candle vigils, have prayers, and all kinds of those things. And also, the Indian ambassador met with the State Department officials -- President Trump recently. So any presidential message for the Indian American community, how to stop these attacks at this time?MR. SPICER: I think with respect to -- are you talking about the event in Kansas City specifically?Q  Yeah, and another one also.MR. SPICER: I think the President -- whether its the event that happened in Kansas City, other events, the attacks on Jewish community centers that continue to plague us -- we saw another report this morning of some unfortunate activity. I think weve got to continue to call it out, weve got to continue to root it out, weve got to continue to engage law enforcement, whatever is the applicable level of law enforcement depending on the event.But its something that I think all Americans should be outraged and disgusted by -- and stand up for the principles that unite us, and thats what the President spoke so eloquently about during his joint address, and made it very clear that while certain policies may divide us as individuals, there are certain principles that can unite us.John Frederick.Q  And second part of my question, please, Im sorry. As far as the U.S.-India relations are concerned, they have been great in the past and now we have two businessmen in India -- Prime Minister Modi is also a businessman, and he -- President Trump of course a great, successful businessman. So recently, high official visits have been going on from India to the U.S., meeting President Trump and officials, including foreign secretary and Commerce secretary and -- from the energy department from India. So where do we go -- what is the future under President Trumps administration of U.S.-India relations economically, trade, and bilateral -- all of those.MR. SPICER: Thank you. I think he has talked about during the campaign and the transition establishing a deeper relationship with Prime Minister Modi and U.S. -- India and businesses. And I think as we move forward in terms of our foreign policy, well have further updates on that.But as you know very well, he spoke very clearly and frequently about the relationship that we have and hope to continue to grow with India.John Frederick.Q  Sean, thank you. During the campaign President Trump was not shy about his desire to get the United States out of these Middle Eastern wars, yet as a question earlier, we just sent 250 Marines into Syria. Is President Trump committed to going to Congress to receiving authorization for an AUMF or a declaration of war if we continue to deploy United States troops overseas?MR. SPICER: Well, John, I think theres a big difference between an authorization of war than sending a few hundred advisors. And I think most in Congress would probably agree with that as well. I think thats a big difference between a hostile action and going in to address some certain concerns, whether its certain countries in the Middle East or elsewhere. I would refer you to the Department of Defense on that one. I think the actions that he has done and taken with the advice that his generals have given him, his admirals as well, is something that we will continue to work on. Q  Two questions. One, first off, kind of clarifying the difference between the campaign stop and also the healthcare rollout. So Nashville will be kind of the campaign stop. How will the White House kind of pick and choose how that goes, whether its going to be a presidential visit trying to sell the healthcare rollout, or one for the campaign? And then a second question. MR. SPICER: I think the campaign will make decisions with respect to how they want to spend their money and where they want to go. And the White House will do the same. But thats something that every President back as far as modern history has done as well. The President will be visiting several cities over the next coming weeks to engage the American people on the need to repeal and replace and other steps that hes taking to deliver on the promises that hes made as Commander-in-Chief. Q  And then a second question, I know Senator Cruz was here for dinner last night. Can you characterize the relationship between the two men? 2018 will be here before you know it. Do you anticipate the President will be there to support him in that effort?MR. SPICER: We got a few battles to get through legislatively, but I know that he enjoyed welcoming Senator and Mrs. Cruz and their two daughters last night to the White House. They had a very enjoyable time and a very fruitful discussion. But its something that hes going to continue to do with members of both parties, both chambers, and not just here in Washington. I think youre going to see him continue to engage with governors and attorneys general and lieutenant governors.The President truly enjoys this level of engagement. He likes to sit down and talk about ideas, talk about the future of this country and get their input and ideas. And I think they talked a little business and a lot of personal last night, and it was a very enjoyable thing.With that, thank you, guys. Have a great day. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. I think tomorrow is going to be one-question Friday. Thank you all.END2:00 P.M. EST",20858.19,2.459999999999127,5838.81,1.2600000000002183,2364.87,1.8899999999998727

Trump and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas spoke today by phone to discuss ways to advance peace throughout the Middle East region, including a comprehensive agreement that would end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The President emphasized his personal belief that peace is possible and that the time has come to make a deal. The President noted that such a deal would not only give Israelis and Palestinians the peace and security they deserve, but that it would reverberate positively throughout the region and the world. He underscored that such a peace agreement must be negotiated directly between the two parties, and that the United States will work closely with Palestinian and Israeli leadership to make progress toward that goal.

300,2017-03-10,Remarks by the Vice President to the Latino Coalition Policy Summit,"JW MarriottWashington, D.C.12:45 P.M. ESTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much. And buenas tardes a todos. It's wonderful to be with you all. You know, the last time I addressed the Latino Coalition I promised myself I wouldn't come back until I learned some Spanish. (Laughter.) That was six years ago, and as you can tell, I'm a slow learner.All kidding aside, would you join me in just thanking your great chairman, Hector Barreto, for that wonderful speech and the overly gracious introduction? (Applause.) Hector, thank you for your continued leadership of the Latino Coalition, as well as your years in public service.His record as head of the Small Business Administration was one of distinction. And I know our current Administrator of the Small Business Administration would strongly agree. I know Linda McMahon is with us today. Would you give her another big round of applause? (Applause.) Linda, could you stand and take a bow? We couldn't be more excited, the President and I, about our new leader of the SBA. (Applause.) You can give her a standing ovation if you want. I don't want to hold back on that. You can get on your feet. (Applause.) Linda McMahon, everybody. (Applause.) You know, our nation is really fortunate. I just love that Reagan line -- didnt you like that? I love it when I come across a new Reagan line. The difference between a small business and a big business is big government. Get government out of the way. And it's just wonderful to have someone of Lindas caliber and experience, someone who built an incredible career -- incredible career and an incredible business as a small family business into an international business, being able to lead the SBA. So thank you, thank you so much, Linda, for stepping up to serve the country.It is a great privilege, great privilege to be back to the Latino Coalition once again. The last time I was here I was a congressman from the great state of Indiana. And today, I am deeply humbled to stand before you today as Vice President of the United States of America. (Applause.) The reason I'm in this position is because of the confidence of my friend, the 45th President of the United States of America, and because of the support of people like you all across this country. And I want to tell you that I bring greetings from the President. Just before I left the Oval Office I told him I was headed your way, and he was pleased to hear about it. And I told him I was headed to a conference entitled: Make Small Business Great Again Policy Summit, and he was very pleased. (Applause.) I think the President wants you to know that our administration, simply put -- and Linda will back me up on this-- the Trump administration will be the best friend American small businesses will ever have. (Applause.) The President and I know what our whole team knows, is that small businesses are the engines of the American economy. As President Trump said in his joint address to Congress last week -- did everybody see that speech? He said we're going to restart the engine to create jobs and prosperity and growth in America like never before. And it's already begun.You know, I grew up in a small business family in a small town in southern Indiana. I went to work at one of my dads gas stations when I was only 14 years of age. Had a dark blue shirt with a stripe on it, had my name on it. I was really proud of myself. Now, for those of you under the age of 30, if you're wondering what a gas station attendant was -- (laughter) -- just imagine if when you pulled into a gas station, some young person ran out with a name on their shirt, pumped your gas, cleaned your windshield, checked your tires, and didnt charge you any more money for it. It was a great job, a great experience.But I grew up in a family business so I know the sacrifices all of you make. And as the world knows, President Trump also grew up in a family business as well. It was a little bit bigger than my dads. By the end of the day, it's the same principle. I was just in a meeting yesterday with the President in the Cabinet Room, and we were talking about infrastructure with leaders. And an old friend of his said that he and the President had grown up the same way. He said, come Saturday mornings, even when we were very young, the time that we spent with our dad was we were out on a job site. And that's what it is to be in a small business family.I told him afterwards, I said, you know, for me, it was headed to the plant or headed to the gas station with my dad. And I know the small businesses that are gathered here know where of I speak. And I just want to assure you that President Trump and I both know the sacrifices that are required to make a small business work. And most importantly, we know this: When small business is strong the American economy is strong. And we're going to fight every day to make that a reality. (Applause.) Now, the Latino Coalition knows this truth -- this statement better than most. Businesses represented in this room have made an incredible impact not just in the lives of your employees, but in your communities, and frankly, in the nation as a whole. The fact is that Hispanics are driving entrepreneurship and economic growth like never before -- just like Hector said. The number of Latino-owned businesses grew by more than 50 percent over the past decade -- leaps and bounds over every other American demographic. (Applause.) And Hispanic firms have also been hiring at a record pace. This was clear just yesterday -- I don't know if you all saw that news. It's just amazing. We had the most jobs created in a single month in over three years -- the February reports 298,000 jobs. (Applause.) And Hispanic businesses were a part of that success.It's incredible to think that today Hispanics own an amazing 4 million American companies, and their combined annual revenue is over $650 billion. It might be a small business, but that's big business where I come from. And Latino-owned small businesses continue to be the fastest growing sector of the entire economy. Now, let me pause for just a second here, if I can -- it is Womens History Month. Could we give a round of applause to all the Latina small business owners who are with us today who are charting a great, great force of success in the American economy? (Applause.) Incredible leadership demonstrated, and it's great to see your peers all honor you. I know the President honors you as well in this important month of celebration.Before I move on, let me just ask -- could I ask all of those whove worn the uniform in the United States of America to rise -- the men and women who have served their country in uniform. (Applause.) The President and I just never want to fail to acknowledge the contributions of every American through our armed forces. It's amazing that the contribution of the Hispanic community in America continues to this day -- over 250,000 Hispanics are serving in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines, the Coast Guard, and the Reserves at this very moment. I know we asked them to stand, but will the rest of you mind standing to demonstrate just how proud we are of those who serve in the armed forces in the United States and those who have served in the defense of this nation? (Applause.) Thank you for your service. And thank you for honoring all of them. You know, you can't look at these numbers that we're all talking about and not be impressed. You get right down to it, the Hispanic community is one of the most dynamic communities in the entire country. Your success is Americas success, and President Trump and I both know it. The President has held at least a dozen key meetings with the Latino community, especially small business owners, in the build-up of the November 8th election. He did this because he recognizes just how crucial you are to the American economy. And as a businessman himself, he knows what it takes to be successful in a tough and a competitive environment. He promised in those meetings, and I reiterate today, to give you the help you need to become even more successful in the years ahead. All my friends -- I like to say, if you haven't noticed, that the White House these days, we're in the promise-keeping business again in Washington, D.C. (Applause.) It's been incredibly exciting since literally -- I'd like to say day one, but it was actually night one. We came in from that parade, and the President sat down at his desk and went right to work and hadn't slowed down for a minute since. Literally, from that very first day, President Trump went right to work, undoing job-destroying policies and executive orders over the last eight years. After years of delay, for instance, the President signed his executive order to authorize the construction of the Keystone and Dakota pipelines that will create tens of thousands of jobs and support our energy infrastructure. (Applause.) Hes already signed several bills that Congress has provided, rolling back reams of red tape in Washington, D.C. And he signed an executive order instructing every agency in our nations capital to find two regulations to get rid of before they issue any new regulations on Americans and American businesses. (Applause.) So it is an especially big deal for small business. And, folks, we're just getting started, I can promise you that. By now, all of you know that President Trump and our administration has the boldest and best agenda America has seen for a very long time. And what I can tell you now is that on the very top of that list, I can promise you, the Obamacare nightmare is about to come to an end. (Applause.) Now, I don't have to tell small business owners gathered here today about why this failed law has got to go. In the last few years it's been hard enough for hardworking Americans in small businesses to get ahead, and frankly, Obamacare has only made it more difficult to grow a business and make ends meet. Millions of Americans have felt Obamacares disappointments firsthand. Today the average American is paying $3,000 more a year for health insurance. And the premiums just last year alone, the average premiums across the country spiked by more than 25 percent. I mean, I remember -- I was in the Congress at the time when we fought against this government takeover of health care that came to be known as Obamacare. And I remember they told us that it was all about lowering the cost of health insurance. But think about that. The premiums have gone up -- like I got to tell you all anything -- the premiums have gone up 100 percent in some jurisdictions since this bill was signed into law. And last year alone, that average of 25 percent increase has really worked hardships on Americans.In one-third of our nations counties, consumers have only one insurance company to choose from, which essentially means they have no choice at all. And American businesses have been struggling, too. I'm sure everyone in this room can attest to the fact that Obamacare has hit you with more regulations, more mandates, higher costs, higher taxes. The fact is Obamacare has placed a crushing burden on job creators, just like all of you in this room today. It's resulted in lost jobs, slower growth in an economy that until very recently seemed to be stuck in up to the axle. Now, I hear the same thing everywhere I go: Small businesses tell me that Obamacare places a weight on them that grows each and every year. Theyre facing hard choices -- choices businesses shouldnt have to make. They felt for the longest time that theres nothing they can do about it. And then along came President Donald Trump. And now the American people know there is something we can do, and President Trump is determined to work with this Congress and we will repeal and replace Obamacare at last with something that actually works. (Applause.) See, literally, the day after the election -- and it's kind of funny -- people say, did you go right to work after Election Night? And I don't remember a night. I remember the President was able to give that victory speech about 4:00 in the morning, we got about two hours sleep, he said, I'll see you in the office at 8:30 a.m. And we were there. One of the first decisions the President made was that the number-one priority in the Congress when they would convene is to repeal and replace Obamacare and do it at the same time.And we worked with leaders in the Congress in the intervening months to go to work on that. We've made incredible progress. Now, this week, the House released its repeal and replace bill to begin that process, and as the legislative process begins, the President and I are proud to lead the charge. Our plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, in a word, is going to keep the promises that we all made with the American people from the Republican majorities in the House and the Senate and all of this administration and this campaign. We're going to repeal Obamacares individual mandates and employer mandates. We're actually going to get rid of over $500 billion in tax increases when Obamacare goes away. (Applause.) We're going to roll back reams of regulations that are strangling businesses and our economy. And we're going to expand the use of health savings account and create a new, refundable tax credit that will help low- and middle-income consumers the most. We're going to make sure that Americans with preexisting conditions still have access to the coverage and the care that they need. And we're even going to let you parents out there keep your kids on your plan until theyre 26 years of age.And last but not least, we're going to give states the freedom and flexibility that they have longed for, for so long, to design their Medicaid program in you state to best meet the needs of our most vulnerable population. State resources, state flexibility will bring about the kind of health care to the underprivileged that we have long sought and deserve. (Applause.) Our plan to repeal and replace Obamacare will do what Obamacare can't, and that is actually give the American people access to affordable, high-quality health insurance. And that's what President Trump promised, and that's what our plan will deliver.Now, let me say, despite some of the fear-mongering that youve seen among some activists on the left, we're going to have an orderly transition to a better health care system. And we're working with the Congress right now to ensure that as we move into a system that's based on free market principles and state-based flexibility, that that system will work and be unfolding in an orderly way for your enterprises in a predictable way. But passing the legislation that's moving through the Congress now is just the first component of a larger strategy to repeal and replace Obamacare. Rest assured this bill in the Congress is a beginning. Our administration is also working right now with the new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, and taking every available action to give Americans increased choices and the lower cost that they deserve in purchasing health insurance. The name of the game is deregulation.And last but not least, we're going to work with the Congress and work with HHS to make the best health care system in the world even better -- with legal reforms, small business reforms, and ultimately, at the centerpiece of the Presidents vision, we're going to enact policies administratively and through legislation that will give Americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines -- just the way you buy life insurance, just the way you buy car insurance. (Applause.) The creation of a national marketplace is the center of the Presidents vision. And we're working now through administrative policy and through the legislative process that will go forward to this spring to accomplish that. In fine print, I like to say what we need to do is get that little lizard on television, or get Flo out there selling health insurance. (Laughter.) Am I right about that? (Applause.) It's just the whole idea that you all know in a competitive marketplace -- you all are successful in business -- the way you lower costs is not by growing government; it's by increasing competition, allowing Americans to participate in association health plans, allowing Americans to purchase health insurance nationwide.The Presidents vision for health care I truly do believe is -- it represents the best of this country. It's unleashing the full power of the marketplace. And with your help and with your support, we're well on our way to a better health care future for every American. (Applause.) It will benefit everybody in this room. It will benefit the country as a whole.But so will the rest of our agenda, for that matter. So let me talk on that before I take my leave and head back to Capitol Hill to talk to a few members of Congress. We're going to get this economy moving again after we repeal and replace Obamacare. We're going to cut taxes across the board for working families, small businesses and family farms. (Applause.) I promise you we're going to keep rolling back red tape, slashing all the job-killing regulations. We're going to rein in unelected bureaucrats so they can't cripple the economy from the comfort of their taxpayer-funded metal desk. (Applause.) We're going to keep rolling back -- we're going to roll back Dodd-Frank so small businesses like yours have access to capital, access to the best financial system in the world. You got to be able to borrow to grow in small business America. (Applause.) And we're going to pass an infrastructure package so that Americans have the best roads, the best bridges, the best highways and airports, and the best future that we could ever imagine.And we're going to stand up for real education reform. The President is absolutely committed to ensuring that every American parent have the freedom to send their children to the school of their choice -- public, private, parochial, charter, or home -- regardless of income or area code. (Applause.) I know how much that last issue particularly means to the Hispanic community. And rest assured, with the leadership of our new Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, we're going to work with members of Congress to make historic strides so that every child in America has access to a world-class education.We're going to do all this and more, so that everyone can climb the ladder of opportunity in the days ahead. And when the President said we're going to make America great again, he meant it. And President Trump is a man of his word. But Americas greatness isn't simply about policy. Ultimately the strength of this country comes from our people. And as I close, let me say I count one of the greatest blessings of my life is just simply to be an American. (Applause.) All of us, with very few exceptions, are descended from those who came here to this country, came here looking for a brighter future. Some were brought here involuntarily. Our Native American brothers and sisters were here when we arrived. But America, from our nations founding, emerged as a land of opportunity in a merit-based society. And the truth of the matter is that it's precisely that vision of America, that merit-based society, that all of you personify. And it's been a truth, literally, a truth since our nations birth. And as we've strived every day to a more perfect union, we continue to live out that aspiration and that vision. In his joint address to the Congress just last week, the President made a couple more promises. He promised to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States; to strengthen our nations security and, in his words, to respect -- to restore and respect, rather, the laws of this country. Now, that includes the important work that's before us today -- securing our borders, upholding our laws. And make no mistake about it, as we do that, the President has placed a priority -- as we move through these issues, the top priority, in his words, is removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threated our communities and prey on our citizens. And that will be this administrations focus for every community. (Applause.) The President and I believe that a system based on the rule of law will benefit every American, including our Hispanic Americans. Every community from coast to coast will benefit from upholding our laws and expanding our economy. As President Trump said to Congress, and I quote -- Real and positive immigration reform is possible. And I can assure everyone here that as that debate goes forward, we will, as the President promised, show great heart every step of the way. (Applause.) Now, for my part, I take all this very personally. You see, as I said last time I was here at this Coalition meeting, I'm actually the grandson of an immigrant. So is the President. The story in my family was that nearly a century ago, my great-grandmother walked my grandfather out of that two-room house they lived in, in northwestern Ireland, walked up the hill across from their home where I've stood, and looked out at the Ox Mountains, and looked to the west. And she told him she was going to get him a one-way ticket to America because, she said, theres a future there for you. Richard Michael Cawley actually stepped ashore on Ellis Island as a young man on April 11, 1923. And that's how Michael Richard Pence grew up to be Vice President of the United States of America. (Applause.) That young man made his way to Chicago. He drove a bus for 40 years, and he was the proudest man I ever knew, and the best man I ever knew. On Inauguration Day, I'll be honest with you, I had him on my heart and on my mind. And as I sat on that stage, as I raised my right hand, I actually couldn't imagine what that Irishman was thinking, looking down from glory. Except two thoughts. I'm sure he was very surprised. (Laughter.) Because he knew me well. The other thing I have to think he had to conclude is that he was right, his mother was right -- was right about America. It is the land of opportunity. It's the place where dreams come true. It's what each of you proves each and every single day. If you work hard, play by the rules, look after your family, you look after your neighbors, and you keep working hard, anybody can be anybody in America. And I just promise you, this grandson of that immigrant, and the grandson of an immigrant that I work for, I'm going to work with each and every one of you to keep the American Dream alive and to renew it and make it greater than it's ever been before. (Applause.) And really what I've laid out today is President Trumps vision and his plan to make America great again and really renew the American Dream. We have our work cut out for us, and I'm confident that with your help and with Gods help, and with President Donald Trump in the White House, Americas best days are yet to come. Lets get to work.Thanks, everybody. (Applause.) God bless you, and God bless the United States. (Applause.) END",20902.98,44.79000000000087,5861.73,22.919999999999163,2372.6,7.730000000000018

302,2017-03-10,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 3/10/2017, #21","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:44 P.M. ESTMR. SPICER: Happy Friday. Good to see you all. Good afternoon. Two more days until the work week is over -- (laughter) -- full attribution to Rahm Emanuel for that one. As many of you know, today is day 50 of President Trump's administration. We have a lot to talk about and a lot that's gotten done. I also want to acknowledge that today is also Brian's birthday, so happy birthday to Brian. I'll let you guys celebrate amongst yourselves afterwards.In just these first 50 days, the President has taken many key steps towards delivering on the pledges he made to the American people as a candidate. He has jumpstarted job creation not only because of his executive actions, but through the surge of economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since his election. President Trump knows exactly what businesses need to thrive and grow, therefore adding well-paying and steady jobs to the market.Obviously, we're very pleased to see the jobs report that came out this morning. It's great news for American workers. During the first full month of the Trump presidency, the economy added 235,000 new jobs and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.7 percent. Notably, we also saw significant growth in the construction, manufacturing and mining sectors. The unemployment rate ticked down and labor force participation rate ticked up, showing that even as more people are reentering the job market due to the economic optimism that I spoke about, businesses are continuing to grow and create new jobs. The President looks forward to continuing his work with the private sector to clear roadblocks to key infrastructure projects, withdraw from job-killing trade deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and slash the bureaucratic red tape that makes additional hiring difficult for American businesses.He has taken action to ensure the safety and security of the United States homeland, its borders and its people. He has proposed great rebuilding of our nation's military, following a full review of our military readiness and supported by a $54 billion budget increase. He's implemented new protections to prevent people from coming into our country that seek to do us harm. As a result of the presidential memorandum that he signed on January 28th, the President has received a plan to defeat ISIS, designed by the Secretary of Defense and the national security team.Just as he has promised during the campaign, he has made enforcing our nation's immigration laws a top priority, signing executive orders that start work on a Southern border wall, that enhance the public safety of Americans through ordering the strong enforcement of immigration laws that are already on the books, halting funding to jurisdictions in the United States that don't comply with federal immigration rules, and directing the Department of Homeland Security to hire a combined 15,000 new officers and agents to support the system and protect the nation.He's outlined an aggressive legislative agenda that includes tax reform that brings relief to small business and the middle class, a massive commitment to infrastructure investment that will generate jobs and rebuild our nation, and repealing and replacing Obamacare. In fact, just this week, he began working with Congress directly on repealing the worst parts of Obamacare and replacing it with the American Health Care Act. And this particular legislation is just one prong in the President's comprehensive approach to reforming our healthcare system. The administration is also taking additional steps to stabilize health insurance markets and start bringing down costs for the millions of Americans that have been affected by Obamacare, such as stabilizing insurance markets through regulatory reform, including the ability to purchase insurance across state lines, providing individuals and families with lower access -- with access to lower-cost options by loosening the restrictions on the financial structure of plans offered through the Obamacare exchanges.And finally, the President is committed to working with Congress on additional legislation that won't be subject to the budget reconciliation process, that will allow the purchase of health insurance across state lines; that will streamline the process of the FDA to bring down the cost of critical medicine; to allow for the expansion of health savings accounts to allow more Americans to use their funds for more healthcare costs -- healthcare-related costs, and so much more.There's a one-page factsheet that lays out the three prongs of the President's plan to repeal and replace. All Americans can see that one-pager that's available at WhiteHouse.gov/RepealAndReplace. Feel free to download it and share it this weekend.This administration is already looking forward to all that we've been planning to accomplish in the days and weeks ahead. You should have a document outlining in each of your email boxes of the President's major actions during these 50 first days. We've made it available to the public as well at WhiteHouse.gov.In terms of the schedule for his 50th day in office, the President will be having a series of meetings and calls, moving even further along on some of the most significant campaign promises that he made to the American people.After receiving his daily intelligence briefing this morning, the President led a healthcare discussion with key House committee chairs. The President thanked and congratulated the chairs on successfully ushering the American Health Care Act through the first phase of the legislative process. He noted that he was pleased to see the bill pass through both committees -- the Energy and Commerce committee, and the Ways and Means committee -- with unanimous Republican support.They discussed working together on additional legislation to further work towards turning healthcare into a system that works for every individual and family and business. Together, the President and Republicans in Congress will act decisively to keep their promise to the American people. In attendance at the meeting, including the Vice President, were Congresswoman Black, the chair of the House Budget committee; Congressman Brady, the chair of the House Ways and Means committee; Congressman Walden, the chair of the House Energy and Commerce committee; Congresswoman Foxx, the Chairman of the House Education and Workforce committee; and Chairman Goodlatte of the Judiciary committee.In addition to this Hill outreach, senior officials at the Department of Health and Human Services have met with the American Medical Association to discuss the bill, and will be meeting with additional stakeholders in the coming days. The President is committed to making the system better, and that includes making sure his team hears feedback from all interested groups in pursuit of a more affordable and accessible healthcare.This afternoon, the President had a call with President Abbas, the Palestinian authority. Well have a readout of that call soon. The President had lunch with Secretary of State Tillerson, and this afternoon the President will meet with Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Dr. Ben Carson. He looks forward to discussing HUDs mission to create strong, sustainable, and inclusive communities with quality, affordable housing, especially the ways in which we can partner with the private sector to come up with innovative solutions to turn our public housing system around and empower our struggling communities.Looking ahead to the weekend, the President will spend this weekend here at the White House in a series of meetings with his team. The Vice Presidents office has already announced the details of his trip to Louisville, Kentucky, where he will participate in listening sessions with small businesses and job creators throughout the community, and then, joined by Governor Bevin, will hear from local small businesses.The Vice President will discuss the Presidents economic agenda, especially the repeal-and-replacement aspects of Obamacare, and how it will reduce the burden on small businesses. He will then conclude with formal remarks at the Trane parts and distribution center.Also coming up, Judge Gorsuch confirmation hearings will begin on March 20th. Yesterday, the American Bar Association reported their committee determined that, by unanimous vote, Judge Gorsuch was given a well-qualified mark for the Supreme Court. The President looks forward to seeing Judge Gorsuch receive a speedy and fair hearing, and an up-and-down vote on the Senate floor.Finally, the Presidents weekly address is out. It discusses Womens History Month and his plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. It aired this morning on Facebook Live. It is now available to watch on YouTube and whitehouse.gov. Obviously, I encourage everyone to go check it out.And with that, Id be glad to take your questions. John Roberts.Q  I was going to say, your pin is upside down.MR. SPICER: John Roberts always helping with the fashion tips. (Laughter.)Q  Its still upside down.Q  You wanted -- is that a distress call, Sean? (Laughter.)MR. SPICER: Appreciate that.Q  House of Cards promo.MR. SPICER: Thank you, no. Theres no promo. (Laughter.) John, now on to your questions. (Laughter.) But thank you.Q  Our involvement of sending rangers and Marines into Syria marks a dramatic change in our presence on the ground there, and Im wondering, how much autonomy is the President giving General James Mattis to involve U.S. forces on the ground in Syria?MR. SPICER: A U.S. Marine artillery unit and a team of rangers have recently positioned in Syria to provide a combined joint task force, Operation Inherent Resolve, the commander, the agility to expedite the destruction of ISIS in Raqqa in particular. The exact numbers and locations of the forces are still a sensitive order to protect the location of the forces, but there will be approximately an additional 400 enabling forces deployed under existing authorities for a temporary period to enable our Syrian partnered forces to accelerate the defeat of ISIS, specifically in Raqqa.I think, as Ive mentioned before, one of the things that the President has ensured is that the commanders have the flexibility to do what they need to fulfill the mission. The President is obviously, as Commander-in-Chief, made aware and signs off on all of those missions, but at the end of the day, its going to up to the generals to execute their mission to make sure that we continue to defeat ISIS and protect the nation.Q  Now our involvement there really sort of complicates the whole picture because were aligned with the Kurds, but then at the same time, a NATO ally, Turkey, sees the Kurds as the enemy. And then theres what happens with Russia and its involvement with the Syrian government. So the big problem with Iraq was we never planned for the day after.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  So what are the plans for the day after here when Raqqa falls? Who occupies it?MR. SPICER: Well, one of the things that I mentioned in the script that is part of what the President has done during his first 50 days is issue an executive order on January 28th for the Secretary of Defense to submit a comprehensive plan in consultation with the joint chiefs and other members of the national security team to defeat ISIS. That is part of that plan.And so I think you are seeing a comprehensive approach to not only how were going to engage in Syria, but the total defeat and elimination of ISIS. So that is part of an ongoing process that the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and others have been involved in, in briefing the President.Q  But does the President have an idea of who should occupy Raqqa? Should it be Kurkish forces? Should it be a coalition? Should American forces stay there?MR. SPICER: I think that as we devolve that plan Ill have more for you on that. I think youve already killed one-question Friday, but were going to get back to it.Jon Karl, one-question Friday.Q  Okay, Ill make it one. Sean, the chair and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee have asked the Justice Department to turn over any information that they have that there was any wiretapping of President-elect Trump, candidate Trump at Trump Tower. If there is no evidence that any wiretapping took place, will the President apologize to President Obama for making such a serious charge?MR. SPICER: Lets not get ahead of ourselves. I think its important to see where that goes, and I dont want to prejudge their work at this time.Jim.Q  But if theres no evidence, I mean, whats he --MR. SPICER: But I think youre asking, well, what if theres evidence? Im not going to get into a series of hypotheticals, prejudging the outcome of a report or an investigation that hasnt occurred yet. I think once thats done, well respond appropriately.Jim.Q  Thank you, Sean. Senator Cory Gardner was reported by Politico yesterday to have said he doesnt believe that a $14-billion wall along the Mexican border is the best way to provide border security. Does the White House see support for the border wall weakening in Congress?MR. SPICER: No. The President was very clear that was something that he campaigned on and promised the American people as an effort to both protect our national security and our economic security, and hes going to fulfill that pledge. Hes already started to work with the Department of Homeland Security on both the plans, and the funding mechanism and the bidding and the RFP process will roll out slowly -- or shortly, I should say. But thats a pledge that he intends to maintain.John Bennett.Q  Sean, a lot of action on the Hill of course with healthcare lately, but April 28th is right around the corner, government funding expires. Given that during the transition period you guys asked for a short-term CR so you could weigh in once you were in office, whats the White House doing right now to avoid a shutdown? I talked to some sources, they couldnt point to specific talks. So whats the state of play there?MR. SPICER: Well, Director Mulvaney is going to release his budget on the 16th. Thats the first step in working with them to get the budget under control. Were approaching $20 trillion of our debt, and I think we need to get spending under control.And so part of funding the government goes hand in hand with keeping track of what were spending it on and how were spending it on, what our priorities are. Weve begun that passback process that we talked about internally within the executive branch. Director Mulvaney has had several conversations with members on the Hill on both sides, and hes going to continue to have them. I know the Vice President has been actively engaged as well.But to your question, I mean, thats part of the process. We need to release a budget first about what our priorities are for the coming fiscal year, and then make sure that we do what we can going forward. But this goes hand in hand with that.Q  -- finish out the current fiscal year, so does the --MR. SPICER: I understand. Thats fiscal year 17, but I think they go hand in hand. I think you need to close out FY17 and then I think our budget lays out where we want to go in FY18. And I think once we have a handle on FY18, we can start to backfill 2017.Q  -- a specific ask, you want cuts for the rest of 17?MR. SPICER: Im not going to -- I appreciate -- were not having that discussion here.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. And I will honor the one-question Friday. The President has said in the past the he welcomes compromise, and theyre open to compromise on the immigration legislation thats coming up. This morning when she spoke at the Christian Science Monitor press breakfast, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that she would like to see the comprehensive immigration package that passed the Senate but was stopped in the House brought back, and that was her version of a compromise on immigration. Whats the administrations position on what former Speaker and Minority Leader --MR. SPICER: I think youre referring the Gang of Eight bill, correct?Q  Thats correct.MR. SPICER: I think the Presidents been very clear during the campaign trail that thats not a bill that he supports. But he looks forward to engaging with members to find a way forward to fix our broken immigration system.That bill in particular I think is a nonstarter. It was a nonstarter when it came out the first time. I think it continues to be a nonstarter. But the President recognizes that the system is broken and that he wants to work with Congress to fix it.Hunter.Q  Thank you, Sean. Does the White House believe theres such a thing as the deep state thats actively working to undermine the President? MR. SPICER: Well, I think that theres no question when you have eight years of one party in office that there are people who stay in government who are affiliated with, joined, and continue to espouse the agenda of the previous administration. So I dont think it should come as any surprise that there are people that burrowed into government during eight years of the last administration, and may have believed in that agenda and what to continue to seek it. I dont think that should come as a surprise to anyone.Q  And will the Director of the CIA or the DNI have a presidential mandate to seek these people out and fire them or purge them from the government?MR. SPICER: Thats not part of the CIAs mandate under any circumstances, so I dont know on that. Blake.Q  Sean, thanks. The DNC just put out a statement a little while ago saying it is President Obama who deserves the credit for the February jobs numbers. MR. SPICER: Im sure they did.Q  My question to you, how much do you feel that President Trump should be credited for that, and how would you characterize the economy that President Trump was handed over by President Obama?MR. SPICER: Look, numbers are going to go up and down. We recognize that. But I think theres no question when you look at the CEOs that hire people and the CEOs that have talked about the investment that they want to make in America -- you can look back over the last several administrations, I dont believe Ive ever seen the number of CEOs and businesses come out and talk about investments and continuing investments and the expansion of investments or hiring based on the vision and agenda of an administration the way they have in this one.And so it's not just a question of what we believe. I think if you look at the automakers, the other manufacturers, and, frankly, some of the service industries that have come out and talked about the investment that they're going to make, or the continuation of a project that they had going, or the movement of one -- of a manufacturing plant or job investment -- those speak for themselves. It's not a question of what we believe. I think it's a question of the commitment that U.S. manufacturers and job creators and businesses are making because they want to buy into the President's agenda and vision for creating a more tax and regulatory business-friendly environment to grow here. And I think that those speak for themselves.Q  Do you believe, though, that he's had -- that the policies already have had an impact on them?MR. SPICER: Absolutely. Look at the confidence indexes. They're all going to the top. I think the stock market has generated over $3 billion of additional wealth since he was elected. There are several economic indicators that show signs of strength because of the President's vision and agenda. And I don't think that that's any secret.I mean, when you talk to the economists, when you talk to business leaders, they have confidence in the President's agenda that it will yield for a more favorable business climate to hire more Americans, to expand the manufacturing based in America, to make us more competitive around the globe. And so I do believe that. But I don't think it's a question of what I believe or what the administration believes. I think if you look at what outside economists and what business leaders do, they confirm that.Eamon.Q  Thanks, Sean. In the past, the President has referred to particular job reports as ""phony"" or ""totally fiction."" Does the President believe that this jobs report was accurate and a fair way to measure the economy?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I talked to the President prior to this, and he said to quote him very clearly -- ""They may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now."" (Laughter.)Sara.Q  Thanks, Sean. Could you clear up what appears to be some tension between what you said yesterday about when the administration or the President was made aware of General Flynn's foreign lobbying ties and the AP reporting today that the transition team was informed of Flynn's potential need to register?MR. SPICER: So there's a big difference between when he filed, which was the other day -- two days ago -- and what happened then. What the AP is reporting, just so we're clear, is that a personal lawyer of General Flynn's contacted a transition lawyer and asked for guidance on what he should or should not do. The lawyer was instructed that that wasn't the role of the transition, and that it was up to the personal lawyer to work with the appropriate authorities or subject matter experts to determine what was appropriate and what was not appropriate in terms of filing.But this was a personal matter. It's a business matter. It's not something that would be appropriate for a government entity to give someone guidance on when they should file as an individual -- as a private citizen. That was the guidance that was given, which is consistent with what should be done. And so I don't think it should be a shock to anybody that if you asked a government lawyer what you should do in your private capacity as a citizen, they're going to tell you you should consult experts in that area to determine what you should or should not do.Q  That advice was -- the transition was aware of that advice, why wasnt that then -- was the President made aware that that recommendation had been given to his national security advisor?MR. SPICER: Well, wait a minute, Sara. There are tons of individuals that consult with the lawyers and with ethics experts and say, I own this stock, will I have to sell it? I own a business. I own this house. And for the most part, they're given guidance as to, hey, go seek professional help, consult with this entity, consult with a lawyer. Its almost like asking someone for tax advice, calling -- and what you will -- if you call the IRS and say, hey, I want to know what I should do this, they will tell you to consult a tax attorney. That's not the job of a government official, is to tell you what you should or should not do in your capacity as a private citizen. And so that's a vastly different scenario that any -- whether you -- regardless of what department you call in government, if you call the Department of Education and ask them about education standards, theyll probably refer you to a local entity or to a teacher if you're asking about your own child. That's not why government officials -- they're very clear about the line between private action and government action.Jordan.Q  Thanks, Sean. Does the President agree with House conservatives that the sunset date for the Medicaid expansion should be moved up to the end of next year?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the bill that is before the House right now, the reconciliation piece -- and again, I cannot reiterate it enough -- is part of a three-prong process.But the current process does several things. Number one, its the first time that you're going to have a full addressing of an entitlement like this in decades. It is actually a very, very good thing for conservatives when you look at how we're going to address Medicaid and an entitlement that many conservatives have fought for years need to be addressed.But that being said, the President has also been very clear through all of the discussions -- and Ive commented on that throughout the week -- that as he meets with members of Congress and outside groups, that if someone has got an idea that can make this legislation more accessible, give more choice to the American people, drive down costs, make it more patient-centric, he wants to listen to it.But I think right now that's where the bill stands. We're going to continue to listen and work with members of the House and then eventually the Senate. And so I don't want to prejudge where -- the process itself. But the bill was crafted in a way that I think represents the Presidents thinking and in a -- very smart way of addressing entitlements and going forward.Francesca.Q  So just to put a pin in it, the President is willing to negotiate on the sunset of the expansion of Medicaid?MR. SPICER: Right. Right now the date that's in the bill is what the President supports. He is willing to listen to individuals on different aspects of the bill that might make it -- that might achieve the goals that he set out. But its not a question of negotiation. We have a date in the bill, and that's the date in the bill.But I think as the bill continues to work its way through the House -- and that goes for Speaker Ryan, hes got members that are approaching him with ideas and Im sure hes listening to them as well.  Senator McConnell is probably dealing with the same issue in the Senate. And that's the way that the process is going to work.And Ive made it very clear since the get-go that this process is going to be one where we're going to take the best ideas, we're going to listen to individuals and try to make sure that we achieve the goals that the President has laid out and the principles that he has laid out.Francesca.Q  Thank you, Sean. Piggybacking off John and John, at a breakfast this morning -- the same one he referenced -- Nancy Pelosi also said, ""It couldn't possibly be true"" of the President's allegations against the former President, ""because that is not how our system works."" She also said ""Obama would not do that"" and ""it would be a waste of time"" for the House Intelligence Committee to investigate that allegation. Does the White House have any evidence to refute House Minority Leader and former Speaker Pelosi's claim? And could you explain why the President hasn't asked the FBI chief about this directly?MR. SPICER: I think we spoke very clearly about what we'd like to happen last Sunday and I'm going to reiterate it: We believe that the House and Senate intelligence committee have the appropriate forum and process and staff to look into this matter and report back.Q  Sean, on Flynn. Can you say that the President was informed at all about this arrangement? MR. SPICER: No, he was not.Q  The need to register as a foreign agent?MR. SPICER: No.Q  And then did this set off any alarm bells with anyone?MR. SPICER: No, just so we're clear, you wouldn't -- General Flynn filed with the Department of Justice two days ago. How would anyone know that he was going to -- I mean, that's sort of like asking --Q  What about the need to file?MR. SPICER: That's up to his personal lawyer. I mean, again, each person that goes through the process in government seeks counsel in many cases regarding the assets they own and the activities they conducted as to what they have to do or not do. But this is something that -- it's like asking whether someone needed to file -- if they had a client, whether or not they have to file a lobbying disclosure form. That's not up for us to determine. That's up for them and their counsel to determine if they engaged in activities in the past or whatever it is. Or if a doctor needed to go and up their certification, that is not up for the government to determine. There are certain private citizens' activities that you conduct and you seek counsel on, or professional advice. That's not up to the government. And that's exactly how the system worked.Q  But how did that not raise a red flag? I mean, you have an attorney calling --MR. SPICER: You already got your question, John. We're doing one-question Friday.Q  But this is an important point.MR. SPICER: No, it's not, John.Q  Because you have an attorney calling the transition saying that the person who is in line to be the national security advisor may need to register as a foreign agent. And that doesn't raise a red flag?MR. SPICER: No, it's not a question of raising a red flag, John. It's a question of whether or not they gave them the advice that they're supposed to, which is, it is not up to them to make decisions as to what you need to do or not do. As you know, there are certain activities that fall under each of these requirements as far as what the threshold is, what activities, who the funding source was, et cetera, et cetera. It is not up to -- nor is it appropriate, nor is it legal -- for the government to start going into private citizens, seeking advice and telling them what they have to register or not. That would be the equivalent of walking through someone's tax return and saying that's not a deduction that you should take, that is.That's why, when you contact these agencies, they will tell you, you should seek counsel or professional advice or expertise in whatever matter it is. That is not up to them to determine, plain and simple.Glenn. I called on Glenn -- John, were going -- Q  Moving beyond the legal question here.MR. SPICER: Thank you.Q  Just to follow up with John, moving beyond the legal question here, this is an issue of judgment about who you guys wanted here in your administration. There were published reports that your potential national security advisor had dealings with the government of Turkey, a controversial regime at this moment in time. Congressman Cummings sent a letter to Mike Pence during the transition informing him of this and raising a red flag. Mr. Pence was on television, I believe yesterday, saying twice that he had no knowledge of that letter.MR. SPICER: That's right -- no, no, that's not -- hold on, it stop there. No, no, hold on, before you accuse the Vice President of certain things --Q  Yeah.MR. SPICER: Now, what he said was that he was not aware of the filing, just so we're clear. And he wasn't. Thank you. Go on.Q  But just in terms of the larger question here. Forget about filling out forms and the legalisms here. What does this say about the transition team's judgment about still appointing him as national security advisor when you had knowledge of this information?MR. SPICER: No, but you're asking me -- forget about the legalisms. That's what we ask people to do, is follow the law. You can't forget about the legalisms. Q  No, no.MR. SPICER: No, no, that's what you said. And what I'm saying is, that's what we did. They consulted a lawyer, which everyone who had something of -- is advised to do. That lawyer consulted the transition lawyer, who said, it is your job to consult the appropriate lawyers. Q  I'm moving beyond the legal issues, I'm saying in terms of -- we're moving beyond the issue of the papers here. We're talking about the judgment that the President, the Vice President and your team made to select this man as national security advisor when you had information that he had these dealings with Turkey. Why did you guys still make that decision?MR. SPICER: But it's a question -- what dealings are you referring to? The fact that he had a client -- he was also the head of the department of -- the Defense Intelligence Agency, unbelievably qualified, 40 years in the military with impeccable credentials. I mean, so what is it? That he -- what exactly are you getting at? Because so far, he has impeccable credentials, he had a stellar career in the military, widely respected, and I think for you to start to impugn his integrity --Q  No, but Vice President Pence said that yesterday -- that he wouldn't have that --MR. SPICER: But again, but there was no disclosure at the time. And the question is, is that if his counsel worked with whomever he worked with and determined that he didn't, that's up to him. But it was up to him. The burden is on the individual to seek the legal advice or professional expertise to decide what they have to file and not.I mean, we could literally have a hypothetical question about somebody who made an inappropriate filing on their tax returns or another -- or a professional qualification. At the end of the day when people present it with you, they are advised to seek expertise and counsel and legal advice about what's appropriate and what's not. That is not -- it is not up to the transition attorney to go through someone's livelihood and determine what they need to see. They were given the proper legal advice at the time, which was to seek expertise in that matter. He had already obtained counsel, and that's --Q  Let me just sort of clarify. The transition officials were not overly concerned by his relationship with the government of Turkey?MR. SPICER: It's not a question of overly concerned, Glenn. The question is, did they provide him the avenue that they were supposed to, which is, did they tell him to seek counsel, and they did. And thats whats supposed to happen. Thats it, plain and simple.Yes.Q  Sean, I guess the question for you very simply would be then right now, does this raise concerns that there may be other members of this administration or other members that served in the transition that were or are currently lobbying on behalf of foreign governments right now that may be advising the President of the United States?MR. SPICER: Look, I think we trust people to fill out the appropriate forms that they need to, and in this case --Q  But thats what betrayed --MR. SPICER: -- and the President acted accordingly back in the thing, and he made the right call then.Q  He may have been taking actions, though, he may have made the right call -- the national security advisor.MR. SPICER: But youre asking me -- this is -- look, this is like saying -- can you tell me that the executives at NBC News have gone through every single persons and reporters background --Q  Theyre not the President of the United States.MR. SPICER: No, no, I understand that. But we trust people to fill out the forms that theyre required to do so in an honest and legal manner. And in this case, he retroactively filed the forms that he was supposed to do, but we advised him to do what the legal and proper thing was, and thats the right thing for this administration.So we did the right thing then, and we expect every employee to follow the law. This President, when it comes to ethics and when it comes to lobbying, he instituted a five-year ban, he banned people -- he has ran on a commitment to drain the swamp. He has been very committed to making sure that we institute high standards here and that were held to them.And so at the end of the day, when he found out that General Flynn had betrayed the trust of the Vice President back in the day, he let him go. The President has high standards for everyone that works in this administration. So the answer to your question is, if somebody does something that is not in keeping with the Presidents standards that hes set for every single person in the administration they will be let go.Q  So do you have full faith in all those people that are advising the President right now?MR. SPICER: I believe that everybody has done what has legally been required of them, but I cant tell you that every single person has done everything. I can tell you the President has made clear to every person in this administration you are expected to live up to the high standards that he has set for them, and that if you dont you will be dismissed.Q  Sean, the removal of South Koreas President, whats the reaction of the White House to it? And also, we know that there will be a presidential election very soon in South Korea, and we know several leading candidates. They prefer -- last confrontation was DPRK and also opposed the deployment of a THAAD system. So does the White House looking to the impact of the election might bring?MR. SPICER: Well, I believe they have to have an election within 60 days. Theres an acting President who we have strong relationships with, and we will continue to work with South Korea. They are both an ally and a friend in the region. This is obviously an issue that we continue to keep up with on the developments there. Its a domestic issue in which the United States takes no position in the outcome of that election.Its up to the Korean people and their democratic institutions to determine the future of their country. The United States continues to be a steadfast ally, friend and partner to the Republic of Korea. And thats it.Q  Obviously, you guys were excited about the jobs report but maybe a little too excited, both you and the President tweeting within an hour of the jobs data coming out, which is a violation of the federal rule. So Im wondering I guess both if there is counseling in you and the Presidents future? But also what youd say generally to critics who say, the risk of doing this is politicizing what should be kind of nonpartisan --MR. SPICER: What I understand is that that rule was instituted to deal with market fluctuations. I could be wrong, but I believe thats why it was instituted. I think tweeting out Great way to start a Friday, here are the actual numbers that you all have reported, is a bit -- I mean, dont make me make the podium move. (Laughter.) I mean, honest to god, like, every reporter here reported out that we had 235,000 jobs, 4.7 -- there isnt a TV station that didnt go live to it. So to tweet out Great way to start a Friday, I think, yes, the President was excited to see more Americans back to work. I dont think thats exactly a market disruption. I think that theres a lot of excitement in this country when we look at the policies that the President has instituted to help put more Americans back to work.So I mean, I understand the rule, but lets --Q  The Obama White House, for instance, went out of their way not to comment in that hour-long period. They would rearrange the Presidents schedule around it. It was something that they and previous --MR. SPICER: I get it. And I think theres a difference --Q  -- going forward, yeah.MR. SPICER: Its not about commenting. I think its one thing to give analysis and whatever; literally tweeting out great news. I think, yes, we are excited that when the President and the rest of the team saw the news this morning, as reported on every television station, Twitter, the Internet and every major news site in the country and around the world -- we were excited to see so many Americans back to work.So I apologize if we were a little excited. And were so glad to see so many fellow Americans back to work. But thats -- Ashley.Q  Sean, Congressman Cummings letter to the Vice President in November did lay out that General Flynn was being paid to lobby for Turkish interests during the campaign. Why did that not raise a red flag to the Vice President?MR. SPICER: Its not a question of raising a flag. Remember -- I think we keep forgetting something -- his attorney then went to a transition attorney who was told, you need to seek counsel on this and get further guidance. Thats the job. Its not a question of raise flags, its not for us to adjudicate whether or not someone needs to file under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, the FARA Registration Act. Thats not the job of a transition attorney. Its to tell them to seek additional counsel, or to explain to them where to find that information, not to tell them what to do or not to do.Q  But Im asking about Vice President specifically -- not saying you should go to this attorney or giving legal advice, but why, when this information was brought to the Vice Presidents attention, didnt he raise questions, bring it to the President, look into it further?MR. SPICER: Because I think its fairly simple to say why didnt this occur. Were going through several people. The answer is, did they seek the appropriate professional advice and counsel, and they did. And thats the answer.Alexis.Q  I have a healthcare question for you.MR. SPICER: Oh, good. (Laughter.)Q  Arent you relieved.MR. SPICER: Thats the appeal about it.Q  Would the President be willing to sign legislation -- is he flexible about the refundable tax credit portion of the House bill? Would he be willing to sign legislation that avoided that particular provision? Because, as you know, conservatives are concerned that thats an additional entitlement.MR. SPICER: I think that, more and more, as the President talks to members of Congress and outside groups -- number one, I think theyre excited to understand the totality of this, and I think he addresses this in the weekly address that you can at whitehouse.gov, that continues to explain the comprehensive aspect of this. Our reconciliation piece, the administrative piece that Secretary Price will institute, and then the additional legislation -- buying healthcare across state lines, allowing small businesses to pool their things, allowing health savings accounts to expand, the streamlining of the FDA, going after medical malpractice -- all those things that bring costs down.But as Ive noted before, I mean, people have to remember that if you get your healthcare through your employer, which the majority of Americans do, you are not taxed on that, your employer is not taxed on it. It is fairly inadequate and unbalanced for small business owners, ranchers and farmers, sole proprietors to have to face a disproportionate tax burden because theyre not a big employer. I think this is something that conservatives should be embracing, and I think the more that they understand the comprehensive nature of this, they are beginning to support more --Q  So the President wants it to stay, the refundable tax credit provisions?MR. SPICER: Oh, absolutely.Q  Okay.Q  Yes -- House Republicans that wrote a letter to the White House asking about why IRS Commissioner John Koskinen is still in his job. Do you have any response to that?MR. SPICER: I dont. Id refer you to the Department of Treasury on that. Yeah.Q  Thank you, Sean. The other day, the President tweeted that, for the past eight years, during the Obama presidency, Russia ran over the United States and, in particular, picked off Crimea and added missiles, which the President described in his tweet as Weak! Given that he seems to be focused on Crimea, at least as far as the tweet is concerned, will the President use the authority and funding granted him in the NDAA to send lethal defensive weapons to Ukraine, as has been called for by the House and Senate Armed Services Committee chairmans, and was in was in both party platforms, although the Republican language was watered down? And if hes not going to -- I did ask you this about several weeks ago when Senator McCain sent a letter asking for this -- if the President doesnt want to do it, is that because he would rather focus his efforts with Russia on partnering to try to defeat ISIS?MR. SPICER: Well, I think Ambassador Haley has noted at the U.N. that any attempt to undermine sanctions that currently exist because of the annexation of Crimea will remain in place until that issue is resolved. Im not going to -- the President, when it comes to his overall negotiating strategy, has made it very clear in a variety of circumstances that his philosophy is not one that says, Im going to tell you what Im going to do. He holds his cards close to his vest to maximize his negotiating strategy.Q  But why does sending weapons to Ukraine have anything to do with sanctions?MR. SPICER: Im not going to get into the Presidents negotiating strategy. I will tell you that, as he continues to engage with the President of Russia and Secretary Tillerson --Q  (Inaudible.)MR. SPICER: Im not. Were not -- Ryan, its your birthday. You get a question.Q  Going back to -- my staff, weve got about several dozen emails on -- we talked to congressmen this morning who were getting these emails saying, if youre going to repeal and replace Obamacare, why not give everybody what Congress and Senators get? Can you address that, since Congress wont?MR. SPICER: Well, I think part of what were trying to do, we -- someone asked the other day about federal benefits. Right now, a third of the counties around our country have one provider. Thats not choice. I think the President understands that very clearly, and thats, frankly, why hes pushing the American healthcare -- you know, why were doing this, is that so many Americans have no choice, and that he wants there to be greater choice and lower costs.By doing the stuff that were doing, especially the third prong of this -- allowing competition over state lines, taking the government mandates away from what they have to include -- thats really going to institute more choice. There will be more options. If you remember, prior to Obamacare, you could go out on the open market and go from a variety of different options and tailor what you or your family needed based on the conditions that you sought or the deductible that you wanted. And choice dried up with Obamacare. I think thats the point, though, is that if you want more of that kind of a system, then this is the bill and the legislation and the comprehensive approach that you should be supporting.Q  But specifically, the perception that somehow senators and congressmen get better care than the rest of us. Can you address that?MR. SPICER: Well, thats what I -- yes, I think thats why were trying to pass it the way we are. We want more choice. We want more competition. We want lower costs. The American people deserve a better healthcare system, and thats what this President is pushing for.Margaret.Q  Sean, did the White House sign off on Secretary Tillersons decision not to take the press with him on what should be an important trip to Asia, and the growing North Korean threat? And what are his marching orders? You talked a lot about the flexibility the President has given to his generals. What flexibility has he given for diplomatic initiatives to his Secretary of State?MR. SPICER: As I mentioned at the beginning, the President is having lunch with Secretary Tillerson. I know that the trip was one of the topics of discussion, and so I will try to follow up with that. And with respect to the first part of the question, press is being invited to that trip. Theyre traveling commercially. There is a press logistics component to make sure that they can get everywhere, that theyre given access to everything. Theres a press conference --Q  You can possibly to go to all three of those cities commercially to cover him in the way that --MR. SPICER: The plane that the Secretary is taking doesnt accommodate that, but they have made accommodations for members of the press to cover everything. And I know that --Q  Is that something you advised to him?MR. SPICER: No, we dont get involved in the logistics for every Cabinet members trip. I would advise you to touch base with the Secretary, with the State Department on this. But I know that they have made aware of the concerns of some of your colleagues, and they are making accommodations in the future with respect to the size of the plane.But make no mistake about it, there is a logistics component to make sure that the press is welcome throughout the trip and at every stop, and that accommodations are taken care of, and theres logistical support to do that. There will be a press conference component as well.Q  Would you like, though, public diplomacy and this kind of important diplomatic initiative for this administration to be covered fully going forward?MR. SPICER: I think it will. I hope it will be covered fully.Q  And should they be -- reporters allowed to be on the place with the Secretary, as they have for many years?MR. SPICER: And I think that, when appropriate, they can. And again, theres a big difference between making sure that we carve out X number of seats and making sure that we have transparency and openness in covering events. They have logistical support for you all, to make sure that you have hotels. Theres travel support. Theres accommodations and filing centers. I mean, at some point, this isnt about blocking anybody. Theyve gone above and beyond. Not every plane can accommodate every member of the press.Q  You couldnt get a bigger plane?MR. SPICER: Its not a question -- theres an element of tax --Q  Most Secretaries of State can accommodate that.MR. SPICER: Thank you. I understand that, and theres an element of cost-savings at this point that the Secretary is trying to achieve. But at the end of the day, there has been a press component to every stop of the Secretarys trip. He is doing everything he can to logistically support the press who wants to come and cover him, and they are being open to make sure that Secretary is available throughout the trip.Q  President Trump has been -- was very critical of German Chancellor Merkel on the campaign trail. I was just wondering, how does the White House think that will affect the tone of the meeting on Tuesday, and what type of tone does the President plan to take?MR. SPICER: I know that we did a bit of a readout earlier today on that. Theres a lot of excitement on both sides of the ocean for this trip. I know that we are looking forward to meeting with the Chancellor and her team, and Ive talked to their folks over there and theyre very excited about coming over. Theres a lot of trade and economic interests on both sides, and obviously theres an element of national security that we share. And so I will let the trips -- look forward to the readout, but there is a lot of excitement coming. And I think the President looks forward to meeting with the Chancellor and discussing areas of shared national interest with her.Athena.Q  Just following up on all of this Flynn discussion. I gather from today and yesterday, correct me if Im wrong, I want to make sure I understand the answer to this question. Are you saying the President was not aware that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was acting as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be national security advisor?MR. SPICER: Correct. Well, and just remember, you wouldnt know that until he filed. He didnt file until two days ago, so therefore, nobody would have known that because he hadnt filed as a foreign agent until two days ago.Q  My understanding is that he had filed a lobbying disclosure with Congress in November.MR. SPICER: Again, thats different than filing a FARA request with the DOJ.Q  And one more question --MR. SPICER: Well, its one-question Friday. (Laughter.)Q  Its very much attached to this.MR. SPICER: All right.Q  The other question is, did Flynn disclose he was acting as a foreign agent in the security clearance review before he became NSA?MR. SPICER: I dont know the answer to that question. Thats something that you should follow up with General Flynn on. April.Q  Sean, I want to go back to the numbers. When is it when a former Presidents spillover ends and the new President stands on his own merit? When does that happen?MR. SPICER: Well, I think on January 20th at noon, you start to assume command of the government, and -- what specifically are you asking for?Q  The numbers from jobs. Youre taking --MR. SPICER: Well, I think that this is the first full month that encapsulates the Presidents administration. I think thats a very telling number. Look, and I get it. These numbers are going to go up and down. But I think for the first full month, were seeing the enthusiasm and spirit that so many business leaders have been drawn to, and that is exciting as a first month. But I think this encapsulates a full 30 days of the Trump presidency, and so were going to continue to work forward with policies that will lower regulation and lower taxes, create a more business-friendly and entrepreneur-friendly business climate to allow the expansion of U.S. companies and grow U.S. jobs.Q  And lastly, over the last couple of weeks weve heard all the negatives -- well, not all the negatives, but a large portion of negatives about the Affordable Care Act, and how youre looking to make it patient care. So with that, are there any positives which you could articulate from ACA that will carry into possibly patient care?MR. SPICER: I think children being able to stay on their plans to 26. Theres a preexisting-condition piece. But again, remember --Q  Thats going to states, the way we understand it. Thats subject to --MR. SPICER: No, no, no, but that -- youre asking if theres elements. I think those are some things that -- and again, remember, there was some stuff that was part of the ACA that is stuff that Republicans had supported for a while as well. I think this is making sure that this is the most effective and comprehensive healthcare policy that achieves the Presidents goals.Q  So those are the only two? Those are two --MR. SPICER: Yes. You asked -- I don't know, April, Im sure I could go through the bill and get back. Its very long, as you saw the other day. Its a thousand-page --Q  -- pages versus --MR. SPICER: Nine hundred seventy four pages. Very good.David Jackson.Q  The Palestinians are saying that President Trump invited President Abbas to the White House for a meeting very soon. Can you confirm that?MR. SPICER: I can. Thank you guys very much. Lets end on a positive note. Have a great weekend. We look forward to seeing you. Take care everybody. Thank you.END2:44 P.M.

303,2017-03-10,Readout of the Vice President's Listening Session with Conservative Leaders,"Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price assembled dozens of conservative leaders today at the White House to discuss the multi-faceted effort to repeal and replace Obamacare. The Vice President and the Secretary highlighted the work being accomplished through legislative and regulatory efforts to end Obamacares government takeover of healthcare and provide market-based reforms that will lower costs and provide more choice to Americans. They also invited conservative groups to continue offering their ideas for improving healthcare in America and agreed to keep communication channels open as the President and Congress work to fulfill the promise of repealing and replacing the flawed Obamacare law.The following individuals participated:Thomas Binion, Heritage FoundationMelissa Ortiz, Able AmericansMia Heck, ALECJason Pye, FreedomWorksBrian McManusMatthew Schlapp, American Conservative UnionNan Swift, National Taxpayers UnionRichard Manning, Americans for Limited GovernmentGrace Turner, Galen InstituteKenneth Cuccinelli, Senate Conservatives FundJennifer Butler, State Policy NetworkDaniel Schneider, American Conservative UnionJohn McKechnie, ABA Health Savings Account (HSA) Council Stephen Keen, National Federation of Independent Business Lisa Nelson, ALEC Jennifer Hatten, ABA Health Savings Account (HSA) CouncilDavid Bozell, ForAmericaPhil Kerpen, American CommitmentPeter Sepp, National Taxpayers UnionTimothy Chapman, Heritage ActionBradley Close, National Federation of Independent BusinessKent Lassmam, Competitive Enterprise InstituteJennifer Martin, Tea Party PatriotsShonda Kalra, Tea Party PatriotsAmanda Moorhead, National Federation of Independent BusinessBill Pascoe, Tea Party PatriotsChristopher Jacobs, Texas Public Policy FoundationAdam Brandon, FreedomWorksMichael Cannon, CATOBob Carlstrom, Association of Mature American CitizensAndy Roth, Club for GrowthHeather Curry, CATO",20902.98,44.79000000000087,5861.73,22.919999999999163,2372.6,7.730000000000018
304,2017-03-10,ICYMI: “The American Health Care Act Is A Good Start”,"The American Health Care Act Is A Good StartBy Douglas Holtz-EakinThe Washington PostMarch 9, 2017Some broad themes are clear. The ACA was a one-size-fits-all, top-down approach to policymaking. In contrast, the AHCA moves decision-making to the grass roots by providing funding, but permitting states flexibility in how to deal with costly preexisting conditions, provide reinsurance and other stop-loss protections that permit insurers to function effectively, and trusting state insurance regulators to run their markets. Even the significant Medicaid reform needed to ensure the programs long-term sustainability carries enormous freedom for states to tailor their programs to their populations.The ACA dictated insurance choices to individuals and families with its bronze, silver, gold and other levels. It required that they shop in government-run exchanges to get subsidies, and it levied a fee on those who were uninsured. The AHCA places trust in the decisions of individuals and families by making greater use of health savings accounts (which hone the market incentives for higher-value care) and respecting their ability to follow incentives to be continuously insured. Its refundable tax credit will be available to all low- to moderate-income individuals and will tend to equalize the tax treatment of employer and individual insurance.Finally, the AHCA gets rid of most of the ACAs many ill-conceived tax policies including the medical-device tax, the health insurer fee and the investment surtax. The remaining big-ticket item  the Cadillac tax  is put off until 2025.There will also necessarily be a host of rulemaking and administrative guidance forthcoming from the Trump administration. And additional legislative fixes and changes to the health-care system that cant be undertaken through reconciliation are already underway. But the bottom line is simple: Early criticism notwithstanding, the AHCA is a good start to reform the federal governments role in the health sector.Click Here To Read The Entire Article",20902.98,44.79000000000087,5861.73,22.919999999999163,2372.6,7.730000000000018
305,2017-03-10,Remarks by President Trump in a Healthcare Discussion with Key House Committee Chairmen,"Roosevelt Room11:50 A.M. ESTTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. I want to thank each of the House committee leaders for being with us today. Your devotion and leadership has been amazing, and I want to just applaud you and the diligent work of your committees to advance the Obamacare repeal-and-replacement legislation that weve been talking about for a long time, and that weve been running with and I ran with, and I can tell you. And thats what people want, they want repeal-and-replace. The bill passed just now through Ways and Means, and it will -- I think the committee just voted recently, right? REPRESENTATIVE WALDEN: Yep.THE PRESIDENT: Your other committee --REPRESENTATIVE WALDEN: Energy.THE PRESIDENT: Energy and Commerce. And it was a very good vote, and congratulations. That was a good job. Amazing.We must act now to save Americans from the imploding Obamacare disaster. Premiums have skyrocketed by double-digits and triple-digits in some cases. As an example, Arizona -- which I talk about all the time -- 116 percent increase and its going up a lot higher. 17 would be a disaster for Obamacare. Thats the year it was meant to explode, because Obama wont be here. That was when it was supposed to be -- it will get even worse. As bad as it is now, itll get even worse.Choices are disappearing as one insurer drops out after another. Today, one-third of all counties now have only one insurer on the Obamacare exchanges, and the exchanges themselves are a disaster. The House repeal-and-replace plan ends the Obamacare tax hikes, cutting taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars. It eliminates the Obamacare mandate that forces Americans to buy government-approved plans. We all know that one. It provides states with flexibility over how Medicaid dollars are spent, giving power from Washington and back to local government, which we all want to see. Were going to do a much better job. And the plan empowers individual Americans to buy the health insurance that is right for them, not the plan forced on them by government. You all remember, you can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan. I know, Greg, youve never heard that, right? But it was said many, many times, and it turned out to be not true.This is the time were going to get it done. Were working together, we have some great results, we have tremendous spirit, and I think its something that is just going to happen very shortly. So thank you all very much, and were going to get to work.END 11:52 A.M. EST",20902.98,44.79000000000087,5861.73,22.919999999999163,2372.6,7.730000000000018

311,2017-03-10,Background Press Briefing by Senior Administration Officials on the Upcoming Visit of Chancellor Merkel of Germany,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room10:32 A.M. ESTSENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'd like to welcome all of you to this backgrounder. I'd like to start off by setting the ground rules if I can. So this is going to be backgrounder only. Attribution is going to be senior administration officials. And anything that goes on in this room is embargoed until we walk out of the room to allow us to get you the best information that we can. We're going to start with a brief statement and then we'll move to a Q&A. So you can address -- we're going to introduce everybody. You can address your question up here and we'll figure out who the best person is to answer you.So, again, thanks for being here. And I'll start off by allowing everyone to introduce themselves.***SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I'll start with just a quick statement here to lay out some of the context for this visit. So the President is very much looking forward to welcoming Chancellor Merkel to the White House on Tuesday. This will be their first meeting, and the Chancellor's first visit to the United States in over two years. The level of interaction between this administration and the German government has so far been frequent and robust. To name just a few interactions, Vice President Pence met the Chancellor last month in Munich. The German foreign and defense ministers were here last month as well. Secretary Tillerson was in Bonn for the G20 Foreign Ministerial last month, and Secretaries Mattis and Kelly attended the Munich Security Conference. So we're very pleased with the level of interaction so far, and we trust that this will continue.When he meets the Chancellor, the President will express his and the American people's appreciation for the deep friendship that exists between the United States and Germany. We share so much history, and the bonds between our people are strong. Germany is one of our most important allies and partners in the world, and we cooperate with the Germans on everything from counterterrorism to European security to generating strong economic growth.Germany is one of NATO's strongest member states, and the President looks forward to talking with the Chancellor about how to strengthen the NATO alliance, including by ensuring that all allies shoulder the proper share of the burden for maintaining our collective defense. Every ally has to meet its commitments -- something we know the German government believes as well. So we are heartened by the German government's determination to reach NATO's benchmark of committing 2 percent of GDP to defense by 2024. The President is impressed by Chancellor Merkel's leadership at a time when the states of the North Atlantic face a number of significant challenges, and he looks forward to consulting with her on our shared challenges.We recognize, in particular, Germany's leadership role, alongside France, in resolving the conflict in Ukraine and Germany's enduring commitment to peace and stability in Afghanistan. Germany also plays a central role in the global effort to counterterrorism and violent extremism, particularly through its contributions to the counter-ISIS coalition.The United States is committed to strengthening our political defense, security and economic relationship with Germany and with Europe more broadly. We will continue to stand together with the German people, and we are looking forward to Chancellor Merkel's visit on Tuesday.Q  Does the President that Germany is contributing enough money to NATO?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So the President believes that all allies must shoulder their share of the defense burden. And as I mentioned, he is heartened to hear that the German government is committed to meeting the Wales pledge of spending 2 percent of GDP by 2024. Of course, the messages from the administration so far have been strong and consistent that all allies need to be making progress towards this 2 percent goal. And he is heartened so far by the signals he has seen from Berlin regarding increases in their defense budget. And so I expect that will be definitely a topic of their conversation for the concrete plan to meet this commitment.Q  What will the President say will be the consequences if Germany does not meet its commitment in terms of NATO?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't answer that question at present. I think they're going to have a robust discussion about exactly how to operationalize this goal. And so I don't want to speak to any part of what the President's private discussions and negotiations will be on this issue. Q  Is 2024 acceptable to the President, or would you like it to be met sooner than that?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, of course, that's going to be a discussion that he's going to want to have with all allies, including the Germans. But during his planned participation in the NATO leaders meeting at the end of May, I'm sure this is going to be a topic of discussion about whether it is really feasible for all allies to accelerate that timeline. And so, again, this is going to be a topic of robust discussion.Q  And with the Germans in particular, as a leading economy and one of the participants in NATO maneuvers in other places like Afghanistan, does the President believe it's especially important for Germany to set this example and to be out in front of this and ahead of the 2024 timetable?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: He does believe that Germany, as one of the largest economies within NATO, should be setting an example and should be leading by example, as we do from the United States. And so I'm sure that, again, this is going to be a topic of discussion about how concretely we get there, to the 2 percent benchmark.Q  Hi, I have two questions. Will the President be discussing with Chancellor Merkel any of the allegations that Russia is potentially interfering in European elections? And also, will the two of them discuss any sort of engagement with Russia to resolve the Ukraine crisis?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So, sure, what I can say is that the President will be very interested in hearing the Chancellor's views on her experience interacting with Putin. Of course, she's been doing this for more than a decade. She's met with Putin I think for at least a couple of dozen times. And so hes going to be very interested in hearing her insights and what its like to deal with the Russians.He is also very interested in hearing her insights into the Minsk implementation process and really how we can work together to resolve the Ukraine conflict.Q  What about the allegations that Russia is seeking to interfere in various European elections?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yeah, I dont have a comment on that issue for you right now.Q  How do you plan to get around the potential awkwardness of Chancellor Merkel being a strong proponent of a strong EU? A strong proponent of immigration when the President sent very signals about that?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think the Vice President, during his visit in Brussels, gave a pretty clear message that we are interested in maintaining our strong and enduring partnership with the European Union. We recognize that the European Union makes significant contributions to global peace and prosperity, and so hes going to be interested in exploring this topic more with the Chancellor.Q  Thank you. A follow-up to the question on Russia. The Ukrainian process that you referred to, is it envisioned that the U.S. might play a big role in the process, a direct role?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So I think, again, this is going to be a topic that the President is going to want to discuss with the Chancellor, what role the United States can most helpfully play in this process. But I dont want to prejudge the outcome of the meeting.Q  Hi, I have a question about the EU. Some of the EU officials have been saying theyre really worried about President Trumps views towards the EU. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? About how the EU is valued or how its not valued, and how the conversation might happen?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, well, so I would refer you back to the Vice Presidents comments, which were very clear and direct when he was in Brussels, about the value that we see in our partnership with the European Union, and again our recognition that the European Union is a key contributor to global peace and prosperity.And again, Im sure that the President will want to discuss again his views of the European Union with the Chancellor. And again, I cant comment exactly on how that conversation is going to go or prejudge the outcome, but Im sure its going to be a topic of discussion.Q  You didnt mention climate in your opening statement. Do you expect that to be a topic of discussion, and what will the Presidents message be to Chancellor Merkel about his commitment to either staying in the Paris Agreement or withdrawing from the Paris Agreement?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure.Q  Whats going to happen in the interim?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Its quite possible that that will be something that the Chancellor will raise. They dont know for sure. Internally, the United States is still working on that issue, and thats an issue that still is to be determined and will be discussed, Im sure, with the Chancellor, but also further clarified in the weeks and months ahead, as we move forward to the G7 and the G20 ministerials and summit meetings.Q  Will the President be in any position to clarify what he want to do with the Paris agreement?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I cant speak for the President on that. I know that were working on that issue internally. Whether we reach a decision by the time of the meeting or by the time of the summit meetings I think is still unclear.Q  And just on refugees, the President has been pretty critical of the Chancellor for her stance on that topic. Do you expect that to arise in their talks, and in what fashion will the President -- that?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. Yeah, we expect it to come up. Theyve talked about this issue already on the phone. And you know, at this point, its how we move forward on this. And so the United States and Germany are doing quite a bit on counterterrorism, cooperation on border security, internal security cooperation. We have the NATO action that weve already had in the Aegean to help with migrants crossing from Turkey. So the talk is out there, but there is quite a bit of work going on that we will continue to discuss behind scenes. And Ill leave it at that.Q  The President was sharply critical of Chancellor Merkel on the campaign trail. What sort of tone would he like to set for this meeting?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Im not aware of what criticism was on the campaign trail --Q  -- migration.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, I think the statement that my colleague made is very clear that the issue is one of several that is part of a very robust and expansive -- term in American relationships. So itll come up, and we can have disagreements within the relationship, but, as I said, I think both leaders are determined to -- working together forward on how we address the issue moving forward on the security element, on the funding element, economic element. Ill leave it at that.Q  And whats the Presidents thinking in terms of how to get the Ukraine crisis resolved?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I dont know if we want to think -- I cant say on the Presidents thinking specifically, but he recognizes the leadership role that Germany and France have on this. And certainly the point of this meeting is to determine how we go forward in cooperation with France and Germany on this issue. And thats why were very pleased to be having this so early in the administration.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Lets get a few questions from the back row.Q  With the current prioritization of defense spending by the administration, it would appear that the commitment to NATO is going up and not down, even as the President says money is pouring in from other countries. So what data is informing that? And then a second question is, will the President be endorsing Chancellor Merkel for reelection?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We dont endorse foreign leaders in foreign elections. Those are elections that will be run on domestic issues and domestic processes. On the NATO issue, can you repeat the specifics of that?Q  So the administration has said that defense spending would go up, and that of course is part of our contribution to NATO. So it would appear that even though hes been critical about how much the U.S. is putting toward NATO, that that would actually be going up, not down.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, yes, so I mean, the way that the NATO budget -- or the commitment to defense spending is calculated, I mean, you look at the U.S. defense budget, it's -- we're a global power. So we are committing part of that to Europe, part of that to Asia, elsewhere in the world.So the commitment to defense spending is going to affect Europe, it's going to affect other parts of the world as well. And he's been very tough on the issue, and I think that he's done so in a way that has encouraged the Europeans to look at increasing the commitment as well. We've already seen the statements from the Chancellor and the government on this -- the German government, the foreign minister -- on the commitment to get to 2 percent. So we're encouraged by that and so, in many ways, we lead by example on what we put into defense. We expect the Germans to do so as well, and that's very much going to be how they approach the issue I think in the meeting.Q  I guess I'd like to ask two questions. One is, how detailed do you think there can be of a trade discussion at this point? How much can you flesh out for us now on that? And I guess as part of that, do you think there will be any deliverables? Maybe it's the Paris deal, maybe that's what it is. And then -- well, I have a second question but I'll wait. SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not aware of any specific deliverables. That's not the purpose of the meeting. It's to get together and discuss the range of issues that we have in our bilateral relationship. And it's conceivable that trade may well come up; we don't have any preconceived views that we're going to be expressing on that. We want to have an open discussion on trade issues.Q  The sort of softer question I guess is, over the course of the past year --SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: May I just add, by the way, I mean, we are aware, obviously, that there was a trade surplus that Germany has with the United States, and that will probably be, if trade comes up, a part of the discussion.Q  But not in the context of the President promoting the notion of bilateral, and Merkel promoting the notion of EU is the bilateral part? Like, you don't think you're just --SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Well, Germany is part of the European Union, so you could not have a bilateral trade agreement with them. You have to work through the European Union on that.Q  But okay, so it sounds like on the trade front, that's not going to be the hugest piece of the spending?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't predict exactly which direction the discussion will go in. I think trade will be an issue that may well be on the agenda, and as I said, we recognize there's a trade surplus and there may be a discussion around that as well.Q  On the softer question I think that I sort of wanted to ask, we know that Chancellor Merkel has spent many months studying President Trump by watching videos and reading things that he's written, and I'm just curious, for those of you who know him well, has he been similarly interested in sort of studying what makes her tick, who she is, how to kind of figure out a way to have a relationship in that sense? And is there going to be some effort on his part -- I guess ""reset"" is probably a loaded word, but he spent months talking about people are going to overthrow her, and the Syrian plan is terrible, and all this stuff. And he probably -- they probably both want to find a way to fix that so they can be closer allies. What's his part in thinking about that?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, I am not aware that he -- whether he spent time studying her or not. I assume the purpose of the meeting is going to be to build on a personal relationship and try to have the largest country in Europe and the United States have a positive interaction on a range of issues. So the goal going in would be to have a very positive meeting.Q  The G20 -- the previous administration kept saying that the G20 is the preeminent international group for discussing economic issues. Will it be the same for the current administration?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We don't have any predisposed position as to whether it's the preeminent group or not. As you know, the G20 has dealt largely with financial and economic issues historically, and then it became converted to a summit meeting in the wake of the financial crisis. But as to what its role is in the broader play of international events, we don't have a particular opinion.Q  I guess my question is, do you think you'll be moving more to bilateral -- or are you still committed to working in these international fora?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, we will be attending the G7 and the G20 summits. We'll also be having bilateral meetings at those events. We don't see it as an either/or situation. And we'll see how the overall summit meetings go.Q  Given the recent WikiLeaks releases, and given what we know out of the previous administration, Chancellor Merkels cellphone was hacked, what kind of reassurances can you give her and the German government that the United States is not looking into their television sets, their cellphones, their highly engineered automobiles, et cetera, et cetera.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Were not going to comment on specific intelligence allegations. Well leave that to the proper agencies and departments to address that issue.Q  Does the President still believe that other EU countries will leave the EU, as he said in January? And does he think its a good thing?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I dont know his thinking on that. Certainly its for the countries -- its an EU process, and Im not going to prejudge what he thinks, whether countries should leave or not.Q  And can you just confirm that youll have a joint press conference after their meeting?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: There will. There will be a -- yeah.Q  Thank you. I understand that you dont want to discuss the allegations of Russian interference in the upcoming European elections, but does the United States believe that the elections should be held in a manner thats free, fair and without interference?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think that goes without question. Free and fair elections without interference is the gold standard that we love to see. Q  Just wanted to follow up on my colleagues question. Whats this administrations view of T-TIP, given what you said about bilateral -- on trade?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We have not formulated a final position on that. We have other trade priorities that weve been looking at earlier, but T-TIP is out there and that may well also be a topic of discussion during the meetings. Q  Would T-TIP violate the Presidents aversion to multilateral trade deals? Or since the deal would have to be with the European Union and not with a specific country, as you said, would that then make it acceptable --SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, thats an issue that were looking at. T-TIP, as you said, is between -- one could say its bilateral in a sense -- its between the European Union and the United States. It also deals largely with regulatory issues and how to harmonize regulations in a way that eases trade and reduces some of the burden of a regulatory burden. And its hard to do that if youre doing it just with one country at time.But the broader T-TIP discussions are something that will await the confirmation of our U.S. trade representative and discussions with our Commerce Secretary.Q  Would that, by necessity, have to wait until Great Britain resolves its situation in terms of the European Union and the Presidents expressed interest in a bilateral trade agreement with them?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: On T-TIP, I think -- by the way, on T-TIP, one should point out that the Europeans arent going to be pushing that issue while they have a series of elections coming up through this year, including in Germany and in France as well. I dont think T-TIP is necessarily dependent on Brexit occurring, but obviously the leaving of the European Union by the British government raises a whole series of economic issues as well that weve been in discussion with the British on, and that may also come up in the discussion with the Chancellor.Q  On the relationship between the U.S. and Germany, it was particularly strong under President Obama, and then the relationship between the U.S. and the UK was sort of put on the back burner. Im wondering if you see that continuing with this administration.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think we hope to have strong relationships with both countries. As you saw, Prime Minister May visited the first week when we were in office. The Chancellors visit is coming very soon thereafter. Theyre both very important relationships with us and we want to manage them effectively.Q  Is it realistic to assume that we can have a strong relationship with Merkel under President Trump, given that -- his insults against her during the campaign trail and President Obamas particularly close relationship?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Im not going to get into what went on on the campaign trail, and I really dont want to compare --Q  Whats your expectation of their personal relationship? How strong it can be?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: My expectation is that theyll have a very positive, cordial meeting. Thats been the whole lead-up to it in terms of our interactions that were mentioned previously with the German representative of the German government, and I know thats the desire that we have. Q  Given the Presidents criticism of Chancellor Merkels policies, particularly with respect to refugees and generally the situation he sees in Germany with regards to terrorism, does he hope to convince Chancellor Merkel to change some of those policies or to close Germanys borders in a stronger manner, like the U.S. has sought to do here? Particularly because he said that it was weakening Germany, weakening Europe during the campaign.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Those are German government decisions. Certainly theyre going to discuss security comprehensively, and Europe, the North Atlantic countries. But those are decisions for the German government to make. And the discussion that they have had on this already and the discussion that they will have on this I presume will focus on the areas where we can cooperate. We dont re-litigate the past, we dont go back in and atone for things, but we go forward and look at what we can do together. And thats what the focus is going to be.Q  Given, though, that Germany is part of the visa waiver program, for example, does the President believe that those policies are a problem for the U.S.?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I dont know his views on that and Im not going to comment and try and guess what his views are.Q  Just to go back one last time on the issue of Russia and cyber war. Its obviously a problem throughout Europe. Its also a problem here in the United States. Do you anticipate sort of a fulsome discussion on the issue of cyber war?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: So again, I cant prejudge what the portion of their conversation is going to be, but Im sure the cyber issue will come up because the President is very interested in us having very strong cyber defenses and in cooperation with the German government, again, on strengthening our collective defense against cyberattacks.But again, I cant comment on how much of the meeting is going to discuss that.Q  On the issue of Ukraine, you mentioned that the U.S. and President Trump recognizes France and Germanys leadership goals in resolving the conflict. But at the same time, hes obviously been very critical of the former administrations failure to find a resolution there. Do you see any room for discussion about the U.S. -- to enhance our role in the Minsk agreement?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sure. So as I said previously, I think thats going to be a main subtopic of the discussion on Ukraine, which is what role can the United States most helpfully play in the ongoing diplomatic process. Again, I cant prejudge what the level and the pace of U.S. engagement will be on that issue, but the President is going to be interested in soliciting the Chancellors view on how the process is going. Again, she and French President Hollande have been at this now for a couple of years. They have a very good understanding of what the positions of the sides are. He's going to want to understand the dynamics of that negotiating process and see where the United States government can factor in most effectively on that.Q  Do you think there's any possibility that they could ask to join the Normandy format? SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Again, I can't prejudge what they may or may not agree to, but I'm sure they will discuss, again, what level of representation on the United States side, what pace of engagement would be most helpful in this ongoing diplomatic process.Q  Does the President have a view of what he thinks has been stalling the process with regards to the Ukrainian peace process? Is there anything in particular that he thinks has been unhelpful from one side or the other, or something that he believes should be done to kind of jumpstart this process again?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I'm not aware of anything specific that he's said about that. Again, he is still learning about the dynamics of the negotiating process, and this meeting with Chancellor Merkel is going to be a key discussion for him in understanding in greater detail what's been going right, what's been going wrong.Q  Does he at least think that there should be a larger U.S. role in the process?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I can't prejudge that.SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: We have time for one more question.Q  You guys have said a couple of times that you're not going to discuss what happened on the campaign trail. And I guess my question is, why not? Do you not believe that anything said on the campaign trail would have an impact between -- on relationship between the United States and Germany?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Sorry, these guys aren't campaign officials. They're National Security Council staff, happy to talk about Germany and all that.Q  The relationship between the United States and Germany -- does that not have an impact, sir?SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Not on the diplomatic relationship.Q  Well, I would like to thank everybody. I would like to thank my colleagues for being here and sharing your time and your insights. And everybody who is in the room and on the phone, thank you for participating. And I refer any further questions to White House press or to NSC strat-comm. And please remember that this is background only, and senior administration officials is how we're going with that. And thank you again for being here.END11:00 A.M. EST",20902.98,44.79000000000087,5861.73,22.919999999999163,2372.6,7.730000000000018
312,2017-03-13,Readout of President Donald J. Trump’s Meeting with Obamacare Victims,"On Monday, President Donald J. Trump welcomed to the Roosevelt Room individuals who have experienced significant hardship as a result of Obamacares poor coverage and rising prices.The individuals in attendance included:Ms. Kim Sertich of Arizona, whose health insurance has been cancelled three times since Obamacare became law. The plans now available to her have limited networks and high deductibles. Even worse, she will only have one insurer to choose from in 2017.Mrs. Carrie Couey of Colorado, a mother of six from a cattle ranching family whose youngest son is autistic. The pre-Obamacare cost for her familys insurance was $17,000 per year. After Obamacare became law, her insurance costs skyrocketed to $52,500 per year for a lower quality plan. Additionally, the cost for workers compensation insurance for her businesss employees increased from approximately $17,000 per year to more than $70,000 per year.Mr. Elias Seife of Florida, who has had to change his and his wifes health insurance every year for the past few years because his premiums have increased 30-40 percent annually, and the deductibles have risen even more sharply. Mr. Seife said that the middle class has been particularly hard-hit by Obamacare.Ms. Brittany Ivey of Georgia, a working mother whose family has struggled under Obamacare. Ms. Ivey was working part-time at a small business that provided her family with health insurance until Obamacare raised her premiums sharply. This drove the Ivey family into the individual market, where a mid-level plan cost 65 percent of her monthly gross income, even accounting for a federal subsidy.Mr. Greg Knox of Ohio, the owner of Knox Machinery and Chairman of the Dayton Region Manufacturers Association. The businesses in Mr. Knoxs association have been significantly affected by Obamacares rising prices. Mr. Knox expressed optimism that President Trump will return free market principles to our Nations healthcare system, which will benefit consumers by increasing options and lowering costs.Mr. Joel Brown of Tennessee, a farmer whose costs for catastrophic coverage has spiked in the wake of Obamacare, from $119 per month to more than $500 per month. As a result, Mr. Brown was forced to settle for a much less desirable plan provided through his church, which cost him $280 per month.Dr. Manny Sethi of Tennessee, founder of Healthy Tennessee, a non-profit organization designed to promote preventative healthcare. Dr. Sethi has seen first-hand Obamacares negative effects on the medical profession. As an orthopedic trauma surgeon and Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University, Dr. Sethi is well aware of how Obamacare has harmed patient care across the country.Dr. Robin Armstrong of Texas, a medical doctor whose wife is a breast cancer survivor. Dr. Armstrong strongly opposes Obamacare because its rising premiums and deductibles have hurt his patients. Dr. Armstrong told President Trump that he is excited about the reforms the President is pursuing, and believes they will drastically improve Americas healthcare system.Hon. Stan Summers of Utah, a local county commissioner whose family has endured significant hardship as a result of Obamacare.

TrumpA PROBLEM IGNORED: Despite a skyrocketing debt, past attempts to point out Government waste have been ignored. Under President Obama, our National debt grew by 88% from $10.6 trillion on January 20, 2009, to $19.9 trillion on January 19, 2017.Every child born today inherits over $61,000 in debt.In April 2016, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that the Executive Branch and Congress failed to fully address a majority of the Government fragmentation, overlap, and duplication identified by the GAO.The Executive Branch has failed to fully follow through 53% of the time, failing to act on 243 of the 459 GAO recommended actions to reduce bureaucratic duplication and waste.Congress has failed to fully follow through 62% of the time, failing to act on 53 of the 85 GAO recommended actions to reduce bureaucratic duplication and waste.In 2016, the GAO identified 92 additional actions to reduce duplication and waste.Billions of dollars could be saved if just the previously identified problems were addressed.TACKLING GOVERNMENT OVERLAP AND WASTE: Today, President Trump issued an Executive Order to simplify the Executive Branch to better serve the interests of the American people. President Trump has directed OMB Director Mick Mulvaney to submit a comprehensive plan to reorganize Executive Branch departments and agencies.Each agency and department will submit a detailed report including ideas for concrete improvements to enhance its efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability.All Americans will be able to submit suggestions and ideas on how to make Government work better for them.President Trump will work with Congress to put these plans and suggestions into practice to make the Government work better for all Americans.KEEPING HIS PROMISE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE: President Trump promised that he would put in place common sense reforms to eliminate waste so that the Government better serves all Americans.President Trump: Our moral duty to the taxpayer requires us to make our Government leaner and more accountable. We must do a lot more with less.Candidate Trump: I will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate Government waste and budget gimmicks  and that protect, absolutely protect, hard-earned benefits for Americans.",20881.48,-21.5,5875.78,14.050000000000182,2373.47,0.8699999999998909

The plans now available to her have limited networks and high deductibles. Even worse, she will only have one insurer to choose from in 2017.Mrs. CarrieCoueyof Colorado, a mother of six from a cattle ranching family whose youngest son is autistic. The pre-Obamacare cost for her familys insurance was $17,000 per year. After Obamacare became law, her insurance costs skyrocketed to $52,500 per year for a lower quality plan. Additionally, the cost for workers compensation insurance for her businesss employees increased from approximately $17,000 per year to more than $70,000 per year.Mr. EliasSeifeof Florida, who has had to change his and his wifes health insurance every year for the past few years because his premiums have increased 30-40 percent annually,and the deductibles are even worse than the premiums. Mr.Seifesaid that the middle class has been particularly hard-hit by Obamacare.Ms. Brittany Ivey of Georgia, a working mother whose family has struggled underObamacare. Ms. Ivey was working part-time at a small business that provided her family with health insurance until Obamacare raised her premiums sharply. This drove the Ivey family into the individual market, where a mid-level plan cost 65 percent of her monthly gross income, even accounting for a federal subsidy.Mr. Greg Knox of Ohio, the owner of Knox Machinery and Chairman of the Dayton Region Manufacturers Association, which have both been significantly affected by Obamacaresrising prices. Mr. Knox expressed optimism that President Trump will return free market principles to our Nations health care system, which will benefit consumers by increasing options and lowering costs.Mr. Joel Brown of Tennessee, a farmer whose costs for catastrophic coverage has spiked in the wake of Obamacare, from $119 per month to more than $500 per month. As a result, Mr. Brown was forced to settle for a much less desirable plan provided through his church, which cost him $280 per month.Dr. MannySethiof Tennessee, founder of Healthy Tennessee, a non-profit organization designed to promote preventative healthcare and has seen first-hand Obamacares negative effects on the medical profession. As an orthopedic trauma surgeon and Assistant Professor at Vanderbilt University, Dr.Sethiis well aware of how Obamacare has harmed patient care across the country.Dr. Robin Armstrong of Texas, a medical doctor whose wife is a breast cancer survivor.

319,2017-03-13,Remarks by President Trump in First Cabinet Meeting,"Cabinet Room3:07 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Hello, everybody. Im proud to welcome everyone to our first official Cabinet meeting. I want to begin by updating the public on the severe weather situation. Ive been receiving the latest information on the blizzard forecast, and I think we're in very good shape. We're prepared -- everybody in government is fully prepared and ready.  And the entire Northeast, it seems, is under a very severe winter storm warning. So lets hope its not going to be as bad as some people are predicting. Usually it isnt.Chancellor Merkel and I have just spoken, and shes going to be postponing the trip until Friday. Shell be coming on Friday, and we look forward to that. It will be a very good visit. Ive spoken with my Homeland Security Advisor. Hes spoken with the acting FEMA Administrator, instructed him to make certain that the federal government is ready to provide assistance to the states that need federal help. FEMA and the federal government are ready to assist. They are literally waiting by the phones and ready to go. Everyone should listen to their state and local officials who will be providing regular storm updates. We take that advice very seriously. This Cabinet is here to serve and protect the American people, and that's what we're doing -- even more so than anybody would understand. The folks in this room have done an amazing job, whether its security or anything else. I want to thank General Mattis, who is now Secretary Mattis. I want to thank General Kelly, who is now Secretary Kelly. They've done outstanding work. You see whats happening. All you have to do is just watch. Big difference.Unfortunately, not all of our Cabinet members could join us. We have four empty seats -- which is a terrible thing -- because the Senate Democrats are continuing to obstruct the confirmation of our nominees for the Department of Labor, the Department of Agriculture, the Director of National Intelligence, and the United States Trade Representative, somebody I want very badly. We're in the midst of getting going, Wilbur, and they wont approve somebody who is highly qualified, and everybody understands that. The main victim of this very partisan obstruction is the American public.Yet in spite of all of this, we've assembled a great team and already made historic progress in delivering results. We're rolling back job-crushing regulations at a faster clip than ever before by far; and we're seeing companies like Exxon, Walmart, Intel, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, and so many others announcing that they will keep and create tens of thousands of jobs in the United States. Many, many companies are not moving now, which normally they would have been out of here a long time ago. They're not moving because they understand there are going to be consequences. If they move, that's fine, but there will be consequences. Its not going to be so easy. They're not going to fire our people and move and think they're going to ship their jobs back here and we wont be doing anything about it.The first two job reports that have come out since my inauguration, we've already added nearly half a million new jobs. Right after this meeting, well be signing a new executive order to begin the process of reorganizing the executive branch to make it less wasteful and more productive. We're also working closely with the House and Senate Republicans to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare, all of a sudden, the last couple of weeks is getting a false rep that maybe its okay. Its not okay; its a disaster -- and people understand that. Its failed and its imploding. And if we let it go for another year, it will totally implode. In fact, Ive told the Republicans, why don't you just let it go for another year, that way everybody will really understand how bad it is. But it would be the wrong thing for us to do and for the American people.The House plan will expand choice, lower cost, and ensure healthcare access for all. We're negotiating with everybody. Its a big, fat, beautiful negotiation, and hopefully well come up with something that's going to be really terrific.I want to thank Paul Ryan and everybody -- Mitch, everybody, they're all working around the clock. And I think ultimately the big beneficiary will be the American people. Well end up with a really great healthcare plan.We're also going to send Congress a budget request that will include one of the largest increases to defense spending in our history. And General/Secretary Mattis is extremely upset about that. (Laughter.) And it will be fully paid for, okay? Fully paid for. And I saved a lot of money on those jets, didn't I? Did I do a good job? More than $725 million on them. Hes very happy with me. (Laughter.) In the first full month of my administration following the issuance of my executive orders, illegal immigration on our southern border fell by an unprecedented 40 percent. I want to congratulate General Kelly. At the same time, Ive issued a presidential memorandum directing the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to undertake immediate steps to enhance our vetting process. So we're further enhancing our vetting process. We want people in our country who love our country and have the potential to love our country and our people. That's who we want. My administration will work every day to serve and protect our great citizens, and we will not rest until the job is done.So this is our first Cabinet meeting. I hope this is going to be a historic Cabinet meeting -- historic in the sense that we're going to do a fantastic job for the American people, for our country, and for the future of our country. So thank you all very much. Well see you later. Thank you.END3:14 P.M. EDT",20881.48,-21.5,5875.78,14.050000000000182,2373.47,0.8699999999998909

The rules allow a new type of State-based retirement plan that would lack important Federal protections, and they would give a competitive advantage to these public plans.

Secretary Perrys first day in office started with a welcome speech to a packed house of Department of Energy employees.During his remarks, Secretary Perry stressed the importance of the Departments mission and discussed how employees can make a difference. Think about the ability that you have, and that we collectively have in front of us, with the proper management and authority and direction, to literally go change the world, he said, adding, what a cool place to get up every day and go work at -that has the potential to do that. You realize how fortunate you are to be a part of that.Perry relayed a conversation he had with then President-elect Trump before his nomination to lead the Energy Department. He said Trump asked him to do with American energy what you did for Texas. During his 14 years as Governor, Texas created 2.2 million jobs and led the nation in energy production -- not just in oil and gas, but also in wind power. Texas now generates more wind energy than all but six countries in the world.Perry also addressed the agencys powerful responsibility for securing and modernizing the Nations nuclear arsenal and cleaning up the legacy of the Cold War. And he praised the scientific jewels of Americas system of 17 National Laboratories. Im so looking forward to visiting with the National Labs, he said. Im going to visit as many of them as I can, as soon as I can.Im proud to be an American every day, Perry closed by saying. But today, Im truly blessed and as proud as Ive ever been to say that I am on a team of men and women who have the potential to change the world.Secretary Rick Perry addresses employees for the first time at Energy Department headquarters in Washington, D.C.

322,2017-03-13,Remarks by President Trump in a Listening Session on Healthcare,"Roosevelt Room11:27 A.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you all for being here today. Its a great honor for you to share your personal stories of struggle under the enormous strain imposed on you by the very, very failed and failing Obamacare law. Secretary Price and I, along with my entire administration, and a lot of people in the Senate and a lot of people in the House are committed to repealing and replacing this disastrous law with a healthcare plan that lowers cost, expands choice, and ensures access for everyone. You represent the millions of Americans who have seen their Obamacare premiums increase by double digits and even triple digits. In Arizona, the rates were over 116 percent last year -- 116 percent increase. And the deductibles are so high you dont even get to use it.Many Americans lost their plans and doctors altogether, and one-third of the counties -- think of it, one-third only have one insurer left. The insurance companies are fleeing. Theyre gone; so many gone. The House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare will provide you and your fellow citizens with more choices -- far more choices at lower cost. Americans should pick the plan they want. Now theyll be able to pick the plan they want, theyll be able to pick the doctor they want. Theyll be able to do a lot of things that the other plan was supposed to give and it never gave. You dont pick your doctor, you dont pick your plan -- you remember that one.Were not going to have one-size-fits-all. Instead, were going to be working to unleash the power of the private marketplace to let insurers come in and compete for your business. And youll see rates go down, down, down, and youll see plans go up, up, up. Youll have a lot of choices. Youll have plans that nobody is even thinking of today. They will have plans that today nobody has even thought about, because the market is going to enforce that, with millions and millions of people wanting healthcare. More competition and less regulation will finally bring down the cost of care, and I think it will bring it down very significantly. Unfortunately, it takes a while to get there, because you have to let that marketplace kick in, and its going to take a little while to get there. Once it does, its going to be a thing of beauty. I wish it didnt take a year or two years, but thats whats going to happen, and thats the way it works. But were willing to go through that process.Working together, well get the job done. And I have to say this just in closing, and then I want to hear some of your stories, and well let the press stay for your stories if you like. But the press is making Obamacare look so good all of a sudden. Im watching the news -- looks so good. Theyre showing these reports about ""this one gets so much and this one gets so much."" First of all, it covers very few people. And its imploding. And 17 will be the worst year. And I said it once, Ill say it again -- because Obama is gone -- things are going to be very bad this year for the people with Obamacare. Theyre going to have tremendous increases. And the Republicans, frankly, are putting themselves in a very bad position -- and I tell this to Tom Price all the time -- by repealing Obamacare -- because people arent going to see the truly devastating effects of Obamacare. Theyre not going to see the devastation in 17 and 18 and 19. It'll be gone by then, whether we do it or not. Itll be imploded off the map. So the press is making it look so wonderful so that if we end it, everyone is going to say, ""Oh, remember how great Obamacare used to be, remember how wonderful it used to be, it was so great."" Its a little bit like President Obama. When he left, people liked him. When he was here, people didnt like him so much. Thats the way life goes. Thats human nature. The fact is, Obamacare is a disaster. And I say this to the Republicans all the time: By repealing it, by getting rid of it, by ending it, everyone is going to say, ""Oh, it used to be so great."" But it wasnt great. And I tell Tom Price and I tell Paul Ryan, I tell everyone of them -- I say, the best thing you can do politically is wait a year, because its going to blow itself off the map. But thats the wrong thing to do for the country, its the wrong thing to do for our citizens.So with that, Id like to introduce some of the folks and you could say a few words about your experience with Obamacare. And perhaps the press will even report it. (Laughter.) Would you like to start?MS. COUEY: Yeah, thank you for this opportunity, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you.MS. COUEY: Our rates are three times what they were before Obamacare started. We have one provider in our county. We have very little options for what we can and cannot do. Were a small-business owner; were actually not a brick-and-mortar, we are cattle ranchers. We cant afford our equipment if were paying these rates year after year after year.Our food source is in jeopardy because of this healthcare law. Its my basic --THE PRESIDENT: I know. Sorry. Don't worry. Don't worry. This is whats happening. Its gone up three times, and then you have to pay -- if you dont want to use it, you have to pay. Thats the all-time beauty. If you dont want to use it, you have to pay. And, Tom, you have to pay big league, right? Some people say, well, if I use it, I use it, Im paying too much. If I dont use it, I have to pay a penalty. And do you have to pay penalties? Do you ever do that, or you have to --MS. COUEY: We havent as of yet, but we were uninsured in December. They dropped us for the fourth time, after we paid over $50,000 last year for healthcare expenses.THE PRESIDENT: And its gone up triple. MS. COUEY: Yes.THE PRESIDENT: And before Obamacare, you actually had good healthcare.MS. COUEY: We did. We had a fantastic plan.THE PRESIDENT: A lot of people -- nobody ever takes that into account. Im not saying the system before was good, because it wasnt, but millions of people had great healthcare that they loved. Now, when you start deducting those millions of people from the so-called people that are happy, you have a very small number of people that are happy. That, I can tell you. How about you?PARTICIPANT: Well, were kind of the same story as Carrie. In 2009, I left a full-time job to be a stay-at-home mom to two kids. For our family, it was never an option to get government assistance; we just dont believe our neighbors should work harder so that we dont have to. So my husband said, if you can pay for our insurance -- which at the time was $650 a month for private health insurance for a family of four -- then that was fine.From 2009 to 2015, that private insurance went up by 102 percent. Finally, his employer told us in 2015, when it went up the final time an additional 34 percent, that they couldnt carry our family anymore, so I had to enter back into the workforce but I couldnt find a job that offered health insurance. So we entered under Obamacare, and we believed the sales pitch that, ""If you like your doctor you can keep your doctor."" So even though we were going to have to pay $1,300 a month for Obamacare, we thought wed still be okay with our doctors. We were on it for five months. Our pediatrician for our children wouldnt take it, my doctor wouldnt take it, so we paid them $8,000 in five months and were never able to use it.And I think what makes our family story unique is, were by no means wealthy. In 2014, when we entered the exchange, we made $53,000 as a family, my husband and I together -- that was our gross income. And then in 2015, we made together -- since I had gone back to work -- $74,000. But when you look at paying $10,000 in health premiums and insurance -- and health costs --THE PRESIDENT: So its been a rough go.PARTICIPANT: It has, its been hard.THE PRESIDENT: How have you found Obamacare?PARTICIPANT: Well be so happy to see it gone. I mean, its almost put our family in financial ruin, and I think thats the story for a lot of people. THE PRESIDENT: Its put businesses in financial ruin.PARTICIPANT: Thats right. THE PRESIDENT: Its one of the biggest costs -- it has been disastrous for businesses. Go ahead, sir.MR. SEIFE: Yes, first of all, Mr. President, thank you for having us here.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.MR. SEIFE: I think its a great opportunity to talk to the American people, people like ourselves that have struggled with the healthcare law. I myself am from Miami. I havent had very much time to prepare, but the President of the United States calls and Im here. (Laughter.) So it just so happened I had -- every single year for the past couple of years Ive had a different insurance every single year. Before, I had an individual plan, my wife and I -- my wife is an attorney, Im a computer programmer; Im a small business, my wife is a small business. And I just dont understand what happened. I have a daughter with a disability. Weve changed our plan every year. THE PRESIDENT: So your insurance was good before Obamacare.MR. SEIFE: Oh, absolutely. I never had --THE PRESIDENT: Many people are like that. Many, many plans were great before Obamacare. They were so happy. And that doesnt justify the system before Obamacare, but people are miserable now, and its putting people out of business and its putting them in the poorhouse. Go ahead.MR. SEIFE: Its just that we had to -- they cancelled our plans, and I couldnt understand why they cancelled our plans. So we had no other choice. I remember the President of the United States say that individual plans will not be covered, you need to have an employer-based plan. I do not work for the government, I do not work for a large employer.THE PRESIDENT: Very unfair.MR. SEIFE: We are ground zero. My case is ground zero for the healthcare law.THE PRESIDENT: And you represent a lot of people in the same situation. MR. SEIFE: Absolutely.THE PRESIDENT: Its very unfair.MR. SEIFE: Like my friend here, shes in the same situation. And I think its very, very unfair. And I think that the real scenario was that this law was supposed to implode, like you were saying. And my parents are from -- came from communist Cuba, they know what socialism is all about. So I know what socialism is, and thats pretty much what -- this whole system was meant to have one single provider.THE PRESIDENT: Well, it turns out it's so expensive its almost not socialism when you think about it. (Laughter.) You have to pay so much.What do you think? Go ahead.MS. SERTICH: Im from Arizona, and I can tell you that the 116-percent increase is real, its not a myth. I lost my plan three times during the Obamacare era. After losing it this year I decided to opt out. So right now I do not have traditional healthcare.And I went from a $365-a-month premium last year to a $809-premium this year.THE PRESIDENT: And a higher deductible.MS. SERTICH: The deductible was going to be $6,800, no copays. So if I went to the doctor, I would be paying out of my pocket, and it just didnt seem like a good use of my money. I thought I would be a better steward of that $17,000 at the end of the year should I have reached my deductible, and just decided to opt out. I went into a faith-based share program, and Im doing that. One of the reasons I felt like I can do this -- totally taking a leap of faith -- is because I think -- I know youre going to get this taken care of. So I thought its only going to be for a year. I will be on this program, I will opt out of traditional healthcare, or health insurance. And I think youre going to get it done.THE PRESIDENT: You have a lot of people in Arizona paying a big penalty?MS. SERTICH: Yes.THE PRESIDENT: Youre paying the penalty?MS. SERTICH: Well, and my husband also owns his own business and cant afford to offer insurance to employees. And his employees who are also in the independent market, its just getting too much. And Ive had individual insurance for 25 years, since I started my business. So Ive always been in that individual market, Ive always done what was right. I took responsibility for myself, made sure I was covered for healthcare because Im a businessperson, I dont want any huge healthcare expenses to affect the money that could be going to my business now having to go to a health expense.So I was in my mid-20s when I said, you know what, Ive got to get -- weve got to get square with this, I have to have independent insurance. So, I have. THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much. The people of Arizona have been hit very, very hard. At least 116 percent. Heres the bad news: Its going to go up more this year. Now, if we repeal it, nobody is going to know that, and the press is going to say how wonderful it was, and, gee, we miss Obamacare. Thats the problem. Its the biggest problem I have, Tom. Were going to do them a big favor, but its not the right way.Go ahead.MR. BROWN: Mr. President, thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Louis.MR. BROWN: My name is Louis Brown. I work for the Christ Medicus Foundation. I'm an attorney by trade. In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was going through Congress -- what became the Affordable Care Act -- I was working for the Democratic National Committee at the time. I resigned my position because I could tell that the Democratic bill that was going through Congress wanted to publicly fund abortion, and thats not something that I could go along with. So I resigned my position, later worked for Congressman Dan Lungren in Congress, and went on to eventually work for the Christ Medicus Foundation. And were focused on building a culture of life, protecting religious liberty in healthcare, protecting the right of conscience, prohibiting the public funding of abortion, and also prohibiting non-discrimination against pro-life medical providers. Especially as an African American, I'm a graduate of Howard University School of Law. THE PRESIDENT: Good school.MR. BROWN: Yeah. Thank you, Mr. President. And I know from Saint John Paul II -- he said that all of our human and civil rights that we believe in as Americans, that we share as Americans -- the right to healthcare, the right to medical care, to housing, to all of these different things -- are illusory if the right to life isnt defended with maximum determination. Seventeen million African Americans, its shown, that probably have been aborted since Roe v. Wade. And I supported you in the presidential election, gave several speeches in Michigan telling folks to vote pro-life in the general election, and Im really happy that youre here to continue the bipartisan belief that there should be no taxpayer-funding of abortion, and also really to support your effort to show that the patient, the human person, should be at the center of our American healthcare system, not the government. The government has its place, but the patient should be the center. So Im happy to support you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thats so nice. Thank you, I appreciate it. Great job.Yes, go ahead.DR. SETHI: Mr. President, thank you so much for inviting me. My name is Dr. Manny, and I run a nonprofit called Healthy Tennessee, and across Tennessee Im a trauma surgeon. But what we do is --THE PRESIDENT: Ill be in Tennessee on Wednesday.DR. MANNY: We look forward to hosting you, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Ill see you there.DR. MANNY: Yes, sir. We do these large community events in rural Appalachia, across Tennessee, where we host these health fairs taking care of patients. So its really a grassroots effort -- something that you understand better than anybody -- where people come out just to help people. Doctors, nurses on the ground, helping folks with preventative medicine, educating folks. Thats what we do.But the one thing Ive been seeing across Tennessee is that folks really cant afford these rising premiums. So what theyre doing is, effectively, theyre paying the tax penalty because its cheaper and it works out better than paying for the insurance. And so thats been a big problem that were seeing across the state. So thank you so much for what youre doing to tackle this problem.THE PRESIDENT: So youve seen a big problem, and the way out of the problem is to do a plan much more like the plan were going to get done.DR. MANNY: Yes, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Well get that out -- without penalties too, by the way. People dont mention all of the facts. You know, the other thing about what were talking about -- we really have a three-phase plan. They only want to talk about the first phase. The first phase is just the most basic of phases, and then you have phase two, which is largely done by our Secretary, and then you have phase three, which is a lot of the bells and whistles. But they dont want to talk about the bells and whistles. So theyre really comparing things to something that wont be there for long. And the reason we have to do it that way is because of Congress. Id love to do it all in one package, but if you did it that way, it cant get done. So were going to get something done thats going to be terrific.I appreciate it. Thank you, doctor, very much. Yes, sir. Go ahead.MR. BROWN: Thank you, Mr. President. Id like to thank you for the opportunity to be here today. I, too, am from Tennessee, and I, too, am in the farming industry.THE PRESIDENT: Good.MR. BROWN: And the effect that Ive had through Obamacare is my wife's and my daughter's insurance is supplied through her work, I buy my own. And Ive seen the increases, since Obamacare, to the tune of about $5,000 a year, just for me. And I have considered taking the option of the penalty because -- my problem with the penalty is, though, if I opt out of the program, and buy a private plan -- just a catastrophic plan because Im a very healthy man -- if I take that option, not only is my income penalized, but my wifes income as well, because she makes a considerable more amount of money than I do, but she has insurance. So I dont think thats fair. And I dont think -- the rate increase is just astronomical, and Im in the county that only has one option -- BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee --and Ive got about $540-a-month premium for the $7,000 out-of-pocket deductible before I see any help at all. And I even got to pay a high premium for a plan that I dont need or dont want --THE PRESIDENT: Will you be able to continue, in the years to come, if you have to keep going like this?MR. BROWN: Theyre dropping out every day -- the suppliers in other counties. Theres 35 counties in Tennessee that has no options at all right now. I dont know what those folks do.THE PRESIDENT: You know what that means? That means somebody is going to make a lot of money. You know that. Theyre going to make a lot of money. (Laughter.)  Somebody is going to -- well, a few. Youre not going to make it. Theyre going to make it. There are people very happy about this situation.MR. BROWN: Thank you for the opportunity to be here. THE PRESIDENT: Well, I appreciate. Thank you, Joel.Doctor?DR. ARMSTRONG: Yes, sir. Well, Im a physician in Texas, and thank you for allowing me to be here today. And Ill tell you, what Ive seen is that a lot of patients really are not adequately covered by Obamacare. It was supposed to cover people who had -- like everyone has said here -- with the rising premiums and the rising deductibles. I take care of patients in the hospital, and the patients are shocked to get a $20,000 bill, and to find that theyre responsible for $6,000 of that because their deductible is so high. And thats just the situation that cannot continue.Medicaid expansion under Obamacare really doesnt cover folks either, because many physicians are not even taking Medicare. Theyre not accepting it any longer in the outpatient setting. And so folks who have chronic medical illnesses, like cancer -- I mean, my wife is a breast cancer survivor, and most of her treatment was actually as an outpatient. It was very expensive outpatient care. Most physicians dont even accept Medicaid, so those patients are still uncovered.And so the Medicaid expansion really hasnt covered them. The folks who have Obamacare insurance really are inadequately covered as well because theyre still paying extremely high premiums and then having to pay extremely high deductibles. And so its really --THE PRESIDENT: And do they even reach it with the high deductibles? They dont even reach it for the most part.DR. ARMSTRONG: You know, oftentimes they do not, unless they have some sort of serious medical problem, and theyre in the hospital, and its very expensive -- they dont even reach their deductible oftentimes. And so its unfortunate. So I really appreciate it. I actually read the bill thats been produced thats coming out of the House now, and I really like a lot of the changes in it. I think that this is going to correct a lot of the issues that Obamacare has had. So I really appreciate what you all are doing.THE PRESIDENT: Well, I appreciate it, doctor. Thank you. Say hello to your wife. DR. ARMSTRONG: Yes, sir. I will. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Very nice. Thank you.Gina.MS. SELL: Hi, Mr. President, Im Gina. Im from Wisconsin. Im a nurse, Im a mom, and I am part of that huge group of middle-class families that were impacted by the ACA. Before ACA, we had insurance that was eventually cancelled, and I had written a letter to our senator just asking him, what do I do? Do I quit my job completely so that we can obtain a subsidy -- a job that I love, as a nurse in a hospital that I love? Or do I uproot my family and try to find a job with benefits that doesnt even cover the medical --THE PRESIDENT: So the healthcare is -- the Obamacare forced you to actually -- in a sense, forces you, economically and almost potentially, to get another job. MS. SELL: Right.THE PRESIDENT: Even though you like your job.MS. SELL: Right. So I did end up getting a full-time position at the hospital that I worked at. But that came with a price because I was working three days a week, and spending time with my small children, who are my number-one priority. And after the ACA, I was forced -- because we could not afford a premium of $1,200 per month and a deductible that didnt cover anything -- to find a job with benefits.THE PRESIDENT: Meaning the deductible was so high that, essentially, unless you had a really big problem, you wouldnt even be able to use it.The deductible was so high that essentially unless you had a really big problem, you wouldnt even be able to use it.MS. SELL: Correct, yes. And we're still in that boat. I mean, right now our deductible is $6,500. And so if I have a child who's extremely sick, it's going to cost me hundreds of dollars. Just last week, my daughter had a fever, and I sent her to school for three days straight because I had to work to afford our assurance, and I couldnt afford to bring her to the doctor. So it has been devastating for our family.THE PRESIDENT: It's really not having insurance at all. A lot of Obamacare, you dont really have insurance because the deductibles are so high that you really dont have insurance, if you think about it.All right. Thank you very much. Good luck.MS. SELL: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Yes, sir.MR. KNOX: Mr. President, thank you very much for hosting us. This is great. I have to start with something. As I was leaving the house, my 11-year-old ran up to me and said, ""Dad, I'd like to have you give this to Mr. President for me."" (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: What do you have there? I wished I looked that good. (Laughter.)MR. KNOX: ""Dear President Trump, it is a great honor to be able to write to the President of the USA. I think you are a great President and a great man. Also, don't worry, the picture of you on the front of this looks nothing like you."" (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: (Laughter.) That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you. I wish I looked that good.MR. KNOX: So I had the privilege of meeting with Secretary Price and Vice President Pence in Cincinnati about a week and a half ago at a roundtable, and I'll share with you what I shared with them. I started with a quote from the great President, Ronald Reagan, who said, ""The most terrifying words in the English language are we're from the government and we're here to help.'"" (Laughter.) Kind of my feeling on healthcare. Frankly, I think that the system was broken before the last administration got their hands on it. I started my company 21 years ago, and I had a vision of wanting to provide 100 percent full family healthcare for as long as I had a company, because I really felt in my heart that it was the right thing to do. I was one of the last holdouts. But, sadly, after about 15 years, I really had a choice of either having a company or being able to provide my employees that level of healthcare. And that's sad. I tell my wife all the time -- you can have anything you want, we just can't everything we want. We have the best healthcare system in the world -- we do -- but it needs to be fixed -- whether it's small business owners, like myself -- I'm a manufacturer, I'm on several boards in the Midwest in manufacturing. What we'd like to see is not a government-operated market, but a free market. I sell (inaudible) equipment for a living. We have a trade show every year, and there's hundreds and hundreds of people selling competitive products. If we had a healthcare show in my town, there would be three or four people under that roof. And as a businessman yourself, you know what that does to driving down costs or the lack thereof. So we would like to see more of a free-market solution, going back to what made this country great -- entrepreneurialism instead of empowerments; work ethics instead of welfare. And that's what we'd like to ask you for. And I'd like to say thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT: As you know, that's what we're doing largely, but we also have to take care of people that can't afford to be in a position like you are. So we're going to do that. Largely, I think beyond everything, if you look at what's going to happen -- the competitive bidding -- every element of what we're doing is competitive bidding, but we have to take care of people who need the help. And there are a lot of people like that.MR. KNOX: There's always been a safety net in the United States, and there should be. And, unfortunately, when I see 50,000 -- or 50 million Americans taking assistance in -- you know, they're market food stamps. That's like -- for the people who really can't provide for themselves, you know, we're all charitable people who are Americans, we're the most generous nation on the face of the Earth. So I totally believe in safety nets for those who need them, not free handouts for (inaudible).THE PRESIDENT: Were going to help a lot of people, but we are going to be very much free market people. They can afford -- and they'll be off the cost.Go ahead, Stan.MR. SUMMERS: I'm Mr. Stan Summers from Box Elder County, northern Utah. I think I'm probably the only other elected official here besides you guys. It's been an interesting ride to watch the healthcare system in the last 26 years. When my son was born, he was three and a half months premature, 26 years ago. And we had really good insurance. We basically didnt have to pay anything out of pocket besides what we were doing from where I worked. As time went on, you could kind of tell the healthcare system has been a little bit broke, and then all of a sudden the ACA -- and I'm not going to call it the other word -- I call it the last President's healthcare program. I dont want to say that name. So anyway --THE PRESIDENT: Other than that, you like him a lot, right? (Laughter.) MR. SUMMERS: Yeah, exactly. (Laughter.) It's gotten to the point where I own a couple of businesses too and do the things that I have to do. I actually ran for government so I could have insurance -- and won. But now I'm looking at these people, saying, how can I provide insurance for them without raising taxes and doing these things that are happening -- because everything has gone up. Utah didnt expand Medicaid -- we werent a part of that -- and we can see why now, because of the things that are happening throughout the nation with states and companies and everybody else going bankrupt.So it got to the point where I ended up -- not only with my businesses -- I have to drive a school bus to keep my wife at home with my kid that was ill. So now I own three businesses, I drive a school bus, and I'm an elected official, to be able to continue to do the things that I need to do with healthcare. The last three -- well, the last three years --THE PRESIDENT: So it's gone through the roof.MR. SUMMERS: Oh, I got a $6,000 deductible -- HSA -- but I will meet that again in three months. So I'm at -- I think my wife said morning, at 4,800 or 4,900 bucks already this year in March to be able to meet my out-of-pocket. And so by the time April comes, I would have met that to be able to continue to do. And if there was one thing I probably could ask you about -- and my boy has got a rare disease, and I appreciate you talking about the rare [disease] community in your speeches -- is that if somebody has cancer or somebody has a rare disease or continues to have problems, why do we have to do a deductible every year? So Im sitting there at Christmas going, okay, my deductible has been met for six or eight months, and Im going to turn around and have to do it again for the same disease, for the same symptoms, for the same everything.THE PRESIDENT: That's interesting. Tom, could you answer that? That would be interesting.SECRETARY PRICE: Its all about the risk and spreading the risk with insurance over a period of time. But it is a challenge for individuals with chronic disease, theres no doubt about it.MR. SUMMERS: And I appreciate you even thinking about it and talking about grassroots, and when you're talking about all the people that we support with the farmers and ranchers, and the small-business people, and the people that are in manufacturing, our county is one of the largest manufacturing counties in the nation per capita. And Nucor would love to tell you thanks -- Nucor Steel would love to tell you thanks for everything you've been doing.THE PRESIDENT: Nucor has been very good. Its going to get better, too.MR. SUMMERS: And we've got a ton of those. The space program -- we used to make the shuttle boosters out of ATK Thiokal. And wed love to have the space program. I got a really good friend.THE PRESIDENT: Those days are gone, but they're coming back.MR. SUMMERS: Ive got a friend that's going to go up in the next little bit, Lieutenant Commander Scott Maker Tingle, who is headed up on a spaceship from Russia. But he would love to come back to the United States and be able to go up through the United States. So all those jobs I know will come back with you.THE PRESIDENT: Well, Gary Cohn, who is sitting right next to you, hes a big believer in what you're saying -- right, Gary?MR. SUMMERS: If theres anything we can do to help you, the counties are behind you. We can find you low-hanging fruit to be able to pick off that tree to help with jobs. Just let us know where we can help.THE PRESIDENT: Good. Thank you, Stan.MR. SUMMERS: Thank you for your time.THE PRESIDENT: Would you have anything to say, Tom, generally speaking?SECRETARY PRICE: Well, let me start, Mr. President -- really powerful about the consequences of the current law, and you hear peoples lives that have been affected in remarkably adverse ways that sometimes you don't think about as it relates to healthcare -- whether its businesses that havent been able to survive, or individuals who need to take three, four, five jobs; moms that can't be with their kids when they want. This is about real people. Its about real patients. And so working with you and your leadership, we are really excited about the opportunity to put in place a patient-centered system where patients and families and doctors are making decisions, and not Washington, D.C.THE PRESIDENT: What about the concept that -- and everybody knows its happening -- that Obamacare is imploding, that if we don't do anything, its not even going to be around in another year? The insurance companies are fleeing. But now it seems to be getting this wonderful press like its a wonderful thing, and its a horrible thing actually, and getting worse. And 17 will be, by far, the worst year so far. SECRETARY PRICE: Yes.THE PRESIDENT: Because a lot of things were put into 17. But 17 is going to be worse, and I assume 18 will be worse even than 17. So its essentially gone. How do you respond to that? Because Ive been telling you, ""Why don't we wait? Just let it implode, and lets not take the blame."" Ive been telling you that as an option. Its not an option I like, frankly, but its certainly an option. How do you respond to that?SECRETARY PRICE: I think 18 can be better if we implement the law and we utilize the regulatory process to make some --THE PRESIDENT: Well, Im not saying that. Im saying, if we don't implement the law, what happens with Obamacare? Whats going on with Obamacare?SECRETARY PRICE: What youll see is a magnification of all these stories around this table: more businesses being harmed, more individuals not having the kind of income that they -- disposable income that they would use, more moms and dads not able to care for their kids in the way that they believe to be most appropriate, more people getting insurance but no care. This is about real peoples lives, and that's why its so important.THE PRESIDENT: Getting insurance but not being able to use it because the deductibles are so high.SECRETARY PRICE: That's exactly right.THE PRESIDENT: And you hear these stories where they're paying a fortune for insurance, and then you hear how high their deductible is. And unless they have a tragedy in their family, they're never going to be able to use it.SECRETARY PRICE: Yes, this fellow has to -- $13,000 before the insurance kicks in. That's what he has to pay -- $13,000.MR. SEIFE: That's like not having insurance.SECRETARY PRICE: That's like not having insurance.THE PRESIDENT: Well, keep working it.MS. SERTICH: They're catastrophic plans now. SECRETARY PRICE: Exactly.THE PRESIDENT: Hes been working very hard, and hes doing a great job. Mr. Vice President, do you have anything to say?THE VICE PRESIDENT: Mr. President, I think what unequivocally these great Americans see in high relief is you're someone who puts people over politics. And I just want to thank all of them for coming, and in front of the national media, talking about the real world and impacts of Obamacare. You've said it consistently over the last two years that Obamacare has failed. But these people are emblematic of the Americans that Obamacare has failed. And I just am so grateful for their time, but so grateful for your compassionate leadership in driving the Congress and driving our nation toward better healthcare outcomes for them and better solutions built on those American principles of more consumer choices, more free market, but also, as you said, the caring for the most vulnerable by allowing our states to innovate and medicate in ways that will create even better healthcare coverage than they have today.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everybody. Thank you very much.Q  Mr. President, do you have any message for those who are concerned about losing their insurance, whether it be Medicaid or higher costs (inaudible)?THE PRESIDENT: It will get better. If we're allowed to do what we want to do, it will get better -- much better. Hopefully it will get very good.Q  So will it take long?THE PRESIDENT: It takes a period of time. Thank you, press.END12:00 P.M. EDT",20881.48,-21.5,5875.78,14.050000000000182,2373.47,0.8699999999998909
323,2017-03-13,Remarks by the President Signing an Executive Order to Reorganize the Executive Branch,"Oval OfficeTHE PRESIDENT: Today we're beginning the process of a long-overdue reorganization of our federal departments and agencies. We've assembled one of the greatest Cabinets in history, and I believe that so strongly. And we want to empower them to make their agencies as lean and effective as possible, and they know how to do it.Today there is duplication and redundancy everywhere. Billions and billions of dollars are being wasted on activities that are not delivering results for hardworking American taxpayers, and not even coming close.This order requires a thorough examination of every executive department and agency to see where money is being wasted, how services can be improved, and whether programs are truly serving American citizens.The Director of Office of Management and Budget will oversee the evaluation working with experts inside and outside of the federal government, as well as seeking input from the American people themselves. Based on this input, we will develop a detailed plan to make the federal government work better -- reorganizing, consolidating, and eliminating where necessary: In other words, making the federal government more efficient and very, very cost productive.So we're going to do something I think very, very special -- they never have been done to the extent that we're going to be able to do it. And you're already seeing results.We will then work with Congress to implement these recommendations on behalf of the American people. So with that, I want to thank everybody very much, and I want to wish the Cabinet good luck. I think we have some of the finest people ever assembled for a Cabinet. We're going to do a great job for the American people. Thank you very much.END",20881.48,-21.5,5875.78,14.050000000000182,2373.47,0.8699999999998909

326,2017-03-13,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 3/13/2017, #22","James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:20 P.M. EDTMR. SPICER: Hows my pin, John? Q  It looks good.MR. SPICER: GoodQ  The tie is good, the pin is good.MR. SPICER: All right, then were ready to go.Q  Ready to go.MR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you all had a great weekend. The President spent his weekend in a series of meetings with White House staff and advisors planning for a full and productive week. On Saturday, as many of you saw, the President had a working lunch with several members of his team, including Homeland Security Kelly, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Ross, Veterans Secretary Shulkin, and members of his White House staff, during which they discussed immigration reform and their efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare.Over the weekend, the Vice President went down to Louisville, Kentucky. He was joined by Governor Matt Bevin for a listening session with over a dozen small-business owners from Kentucky to discuss the burdens that Obamacare has inflicted on their businesses. The Kentucky business owners shared in detail how Obamacare is negatively affecting their businesses, and reiterated their support for repealing our current healthcare system and replacing with one that actually works.This morning, after receiving his intelligence briefing, the President led another listening session on healthcare with Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price. The President and Secretary Price heard from nine concerned Americans from across the country who have been failed by the broken promises of Obamacare, as well as two doctors who have seen their patients suffer from the laws misguided rules and requirements.This listening session was another important step in the process of crafting and implementing an effective patient-centered healthcare. Americans have been watching their healthcare costs skyrocket while their choices of providers and insurers have dwindled for years. Theyve received those cancellations in the mail as many as three times. Theyve seen urgent care and emergency rooms filled with people who cant afford their high deductibles and resorted to enduring the pain or sickness until they had no choice but to go to a hospital. Theyve had family members with chronic preexisting conditions whose cost of healthcare has more than doubled. And theyve been forced to let go of valued employees or, frankly, unable to hire more due to staggering workers' compensation increases.The President campaigned on a pledge to repeal and replace this unraveling system. The American Health Care Act is one part of fulfilling this pledge; its far from the only one. Hes using administrative action to provide essential regulatory relief to insurers, increasing coverage choices, and providing lower-premium options to individuals and families.He will continue to work with Congress on the additional legislation, part of this three-prong strategy to increase choice while decreasing prices, including allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, adding to the list of healthcare-related costs patients conduct with their health savings accounts, streamlining the process at the FDA so that lower-priced generic medicine gets to the market faster, inviting small business to band together to negotiate for lower health insurance for all their employees, and reforming the medical malpractice lawsuit system so that doctors are not forced to perform unnecessary and costly procedures and tests out of fear of future litigation. Our healthcare system is large, complex, and critically important not only to the health of our citizens, but to the health of our economy. Through commonsense, patient-focused reforms, the President will work with Congress to create a new system that doesnt impose a one-size-fits-all, government-knows-best vision on the American people. We will empower the American people to make their own choices about healthcare that make them best work for themselves and their family, that will bring costs for everyone down. After the listening session, the President had lunch with Vice President Pence and Secretary of Transportation Chao. Later this afternoon, the President will welcome all of his confirmed Cabinet members to the White House for their first Cabinet meeting. This meeting is an important opportunity for the President to share his vision with the country with his Cabinet members, providing direction for them to bring back to their agencies and departments, to ensure that the entire administration is working towards the same goals.Unfortunately, this afternoon, youll see some empty chairs around the table representing the Presidents four nominees who have yet to be confirmed by the Senate -- Secretary of Agriculture-designee Governor Perdue, Secretary of Labor-designee Alex Acosta; Director of National Intelligence-designee, former Senator Coats, and United States Trade Representative-designee, Robert Lighthizer. Senate Democrats have drawn out this entire process for way too long, and these key agencies and departments will not be represented at the Presidents first Cabinet meeting. The President is confident in these unquestionable abilities of the confirmed Cabinet members that will be in attendance. He is just as confident in the demonstrated quality of the four individuals who will not be able to attend. Their absence will clearly be felt as this administration comes together for the first time to receive guidance from, and provide counsel to, the President on these unique areas of jurisdiction.Following the Cabinet meeting, the President will sign an executive order to reorganize the federal government. This order requires a thorough examination of every executive department and agency to identify money -- where money is being wasted and how services can be improved, and whether or not the programs are truly serving the American people.This is the beginning of a long-overdue reorganization of the federal government and another significant step towards the Presidents often-stated goal of making it more efficient, effective and accountable to the American people.This evening, the President will have dinner with Secretary of State Tillerson and National Security Advisor McMaster. Also, he hopes to see Seema Verma confirmed as the administrator of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, another unquestionably qualified nominee whos been shamelessly prevented from taking her position at a critical post.Let me just kind of touch on the week ahead. Tomorrow, based on the current forecast, we are currently in conversations -- in contact with officials in the Chancellors office in Germany regarding the visit. Well have an update regarding that visit later today. On Wednesday, the President will visit Detroit for a trip focusing on job creation and automobile manufacturing. He will meet with auto executives and workers and manufacturing suppliers highlighting the need to eliminate burdensome regulations that needlessly hinder meaningful job growth. Also on Wednesday, the President will visit Nashville, where he will lay a wreath at President Andrew Jacksons tomb at the Hermitage. And as I told you last week, on Thursday the President will welcome the Taoiseach of Ireland for the traditional St. Patricks Day visit. I can also confirm that the Deputy Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, will have a meeting with the President on Thursday of this week. I will have further details on that visit for you soon.And on Friday, the President will travel to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend.Finally, the President is aware of the forecast for the storm thats currently threatening the Northeast. The President has been briefed by his Homeland Security Advisor and the acting FEMA administrator on storm preparations. He has directed his Intergovernmental Affairs staff to remain in contact with governors and mayors in the path of the storm. He has directed his acting FEMA administrator to lean forward and be prepared to help states should they require federal assistance.We urge everyone to listen to state and local leaders and public safety officials to follow their warning and closure notice. They are the best source of information during that storm.With that, Id be glad to take your questions.John.Q  Sean, if I could come back to the U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, Preet Bharara, who was asked to resign along with 45 other U.S. attorneys. The President seemed to indicate not too long ago that he wanted Mr. Bharara to stay on in that job, and he was asked to resign like the other attorneys. And then he says he was fired on Saturday when he refused to resign. Did the President change his mind about keeping him on? Or was it only supposed to be for a finite period of time? Can you just fill us in?MR. SPICER: Im going to refer you to the Department of Justice on that. This is a standard operating procedure for a new administration around this time to ask for the resignation of all the U.S. attorneys. We had most of them -- or a good chunk of them had already submitted their resignation letter. This is just the final swath of individuals who had not at this time. But this is common practice of most administrations.Q  I understand that this happened at the DOJ and the request was from the DOJ, but there seems to a White House connection vis--vis the fact that the President had actually asked him to stay on, and then the President apparently called him a couple of days before he was allegedly fired. Can you tell us what that was all about? And did the President change his mind?MR. SPICER: No, the President was calling to thank him for his service. This is, as I said, a standard action that takes place at most administrations. Then-Attorney General Reno sent out an almost identical letter in 1993. The Bush administration sent out a similar one, as well. So this is a very common practice for all political appointees -- not just in the Department of Justice -- but throughout government when theres a turnover administration to ask for all individuals to do that.Major.Q  Sean, yesterday John McCain said the President should either provide information about the allegation he put on Twitter a week ago Saturday, about his phones being tapped at Trump Tower, or retract his statement. Today is the deadline. Whats the President going to do?MR. SPICER: Well, lets be clear -- the Department of Justice was asked to send information down to Congress. It wasnt the White House that was asked to do that. Just so we're clear as far as what the request was.Q  But the tweet came from the President of the United States.MR. SPICER: I understand that. And with the tweet --Q  Does he have an obligation, as Senator McCain said, to clear this up?MR. SPICER: And I think if you look at the Presidents tweet, he said very clearly wiretapping in quotes. Theres been substantial discussion in several reports that Bret Baier from Fox on March 3rd talked about evidence of wiretapping. Theres been reports in The New York Times and the BBC and other outlets about other aspects of surveillance that have occurred.The President was very clear in his tweet that it was wiretapping, that that spans a whole host of surveillance types of options. The House and the Senate intelligence committees will now look into that and provide a report back. But I think that there has been numerous reports from a variety of outlets over the last couple months that seem to indicate that there has been different types of surveillance that occurred during the 2016 election. Q  And so what youre saying is the President doesnt have an obligation to provide any evidence?MR. SPICER: No, Im not saying that at all. Not at all. What Im saying is the request that was made from the House was to the Department of Justice. I think that thats an appropriate question to ask them.What Im telling you is, from a White House perspective, theres no question that there have been an abundance of reports regarding surveillance and other type of activities that occurred during the 2016 election.Q  And that leads us to believe that the Presidents only evidence are these reports?MR. SPICER: No, no, that leads you to believe that. Im saying to you --Q  I'm trying to --MR. SPICER: And Im saying to you is that what we made clear on that Sunday was that the House and Senate intelligence committees have the means, the process, and the access to go in and look at the entirety of the evidence thats being presented to them and make a determination that they can report back to us.Q  Thanks, Sean. Following up on Majors question, does the President feel he has an obligation, once the investigation is over, to release some sort of statement in response to whatever the findings are? Thats my first question. I have a second one for you. MR. SPICER: Well, lets get there first. I think to start to presume what the outcome is going to be before the House and the Senate look at all of the evidence and information and reports that are presented to them would be a bit presumptuous. So I think -- lets slow down a little, let them look at everything, and then let them make some determinations.Q  And then my second question for you: Has President Trump donated his paycheck from the month of February, like he promised to do during the campaign?MR. SPICER: The Presidents intention right now is to donate his salary at the end of the year, and he has kindly asked that you all help determine where that goes. The way that we can avoid scrutiny is to let the press corps determine where it should go. (Laughter.) Q  Oh, we have a few ideas.MR. SPICER: In all seriousness, I think his view is he made a pledge to the American people, he wants to donate it to charity. And hed love your help to determine where it should go.Q  May I suggest the Correspondents Association --MR. SPICER: That will be a great way --Q  Journalism scholarship.MR. SPICER: That would be a great way to do it. Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. I wanted to follow up with you on questions regarding Michael Flynn, whos no longer in the administration. Theres a five-year lobbying ban thats been imposed upon all Trump administration employees. Does that also apply to Michael Flynn? Would he not be permitted to lobby now for five years because of the agreement that he signed when he became the national security advisor?MR. SPICER: That would be correct. Id have to check and actually figure out when he signed or if he signed the form. But yes, all administration officials who come in are required to sign that ethics pledge banning them from lobbying for five years and then a lifetime ban on lobbying on behalf of any foreign government.Q  And then related to that, what are the repercussions if an employee of this administration lobbies within five years? Where's the teeth, whats the penalty, whats the punishment that would be imposed on that particular Trump administration employee?MR. SPICER: Id have to get back to you, John. I dont know whether thats a Department of Justice aspect or not, but I will get back.Yeah.Q  I was wondering, did the President ask Preet Bharara to stay on during their conversation during the transition or not?MR. SPICER: I was not privy to that conversation. Again, Im not really sure how its relevant at the end of the day. The Department of Justice asked all remaining 46 at this time, that they asked for all of them to submit their letters of resignation based on the same kind of precedent that was set during both the Clinton and then the Bush administrations in terms of the timeline and format. Jessica.Q  I just wanted to ask about the reports about President Xi Jinping visiting Mar-a-Lago April 6th and 7th. Can you confirm that visit and talk about what you want to accomplish with that type of less formal visit? And secondly, with respect to that visit, you still don't have a confirmed ambassador, you don't have an assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Affairs. House ow does that affect your planning and ability to really properly brief the President and make sure he has a strong position?MR. SPICER: Planning is ongoing for a visit between President Trump and President Xi at a date to be determined. We're not ready to confirm that, and we will have more details. It's the purpose of this meeting, of that kind of a meeting, to help defuse tensions over North Korea and the recent deployment of a THAAD military battery to South Korea. Any meeting between the President of the United States and the Peoples Republic of China would necessarily cover a broad range of topics of mutual concern.Secretary Tillerson is traveling to the region now. So I think as we go forward we will have additional details on both the timing and the location of that when we go forward.Q  Is the implication of you saying Tillerson is traveling that he's setting up the visit, Sean?MR. SPICER: I'm sorry?Q  Is the implication of you talking about Tillersons visit that hes going to be laying the groundwork for --MR. SPICER: Well, hes in the region. I'm sure that in his visit to Japan, South Korea and then China that preparations will come up as well as areas of mutual concern.Q  Sean, there's been a rash of -- MR. SPICER: What's that?Q  Is it me?MR. SPICER: Sure. Lets go one at a time.Q  Theres been a rash of attacks on LGBT community centers throughout the nation. Over the weekend, the community center here in D.C., Casa Ruby, was attacked and a transgender staffer was assaulted. This follows similar attacks that have taken place in recent days in Orlando, Florida, New Jersey and Oklahoma. This is not unlike the anti-Semitism that the President has already denounced. Will the President also denounce these attacks?MR. SPICER: Sure. I mean, I think that -- I think one of the points that we've made in previous statements on this is that this is not the way that we as Americans solve our differences. We don't attack each other. We don't engage in this kind of behavior. I think we have a First Amendment that allows us to express ourselves, and that's the appropriate way. But doing it when you're threatening violence or destruction or vandalism is inappropriate in all of its forms.Q  Is it connected to the withdrawal of the transgender guidance, do you think?MR. SPICER: Is it what?Q  Is it at all connected --MR. SPICER: I don't believe there is any connection between -- I think that that would be a stretch, to say the least.Yes, maam.Q  Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about North Korea. You mentioned North Korea. Can you tell us a little bit about the review of North Korea right now and what direction you think the administration is going in terms of the relationship -- trying to manage the threat from North Korea?MR. SPICER: As I mentioned, Secretary Tillerson is heading to the region. He'll meet with his counterparts in South Korea, Japan, and then ultimately in Beijing. That's obviously going to be a major subject. And as I mentioned, when we ultimately meet with President Xi and others, that will be a discussion; it's something that's he's talked about prior to the resignation of the last South Korean President, and was something that has been part of an ongoing discussion.So theres an internal review that we continue to have, but then theres obviously a geopolitical conversation we're having with partners in the region as we look to contain North Koreas military threat.Q  Thank you, Sean. Can you confirm that any cooperation with Russia with regard to Syria is off the table? And if not, is it fair to say that the forthcoming anti-ISIS plan does include some sort of cooperation with Russia?MR. SPICER: I'm not going to get into what the plan -- I mean, the plan is not done yet. As I mentioned a couple days ago, Secretary Mattis was briefing the principals, and that plan is continuing to evolve. So I'm not going to start to rule out one country. But I think the President has been very clear in the past that if a country shares our commitment to defeating ISIS and we can work with them in an area of shared, mutual concern, then we will do so.Q  Second question. A Kremlin spokesperson said that Russian President Putin and President Trump will meet at the G-20. Can you confirm that? And would the White House move on a possibility of a meeting before that?MR. SPICER: I will follow up on that. I don't have a date. I know that the team is working very actively with respect to bilateral meetings at the G20. I don't have anything for you on that.Roberta.Q  Director Mulvaney said yesterday that he felt that the Obama administration had been manipulating the unemployment rate. I'm wondering if that's a view that the President shares. And what evidence is there of --MR. SPICER: I think he was clearly referring to Obamacare, the number of people. But I would refer you back to him and his comments with respect to how he characterized that. I think he can discuss the precise nature of what he meant on that.Q  Does the President feel that the Obama administration had been manipulating --MR. SPICER: I think you know what the Presidents view is. Hes made very clear in the past what his comments were on how those numbers were articulated in the past. And I think theres a question between the total number of people that are employed, and the Presidents comments in the past have reflected that his big concern was getting to the bottom of how many people are working in this country, and that the denominator -- meaning the percentage rate of the total number of people -- is not the most accurate reflection of how many people are employed in this country. How many jobs are created, how many people are getting back to work, how many companies are committing to hiring more people is a much more accurate assessment of where we're headed as our country -- where our employment is, where our economy is headed.But to look at a number and say we have 4.7 or 4.8 or 5.9 percent unemployment is not necessarily an accurate reflection of how many people are actually working, seeking work, or want to work. And if you know how they conduct those surveys, theres a lot of times when people, whether theyre older or younger, or because of how long theyve been searching for work, are not considered statistically viable anymore and theyre washed away.So I think how you look at the percentage of people working can sometimes be a manipulated number. The number of people that are added to the roll every year -- every month, rather -- is a much more accurate understanding of whats happening in the economy.Cecilia.Q  I just want to clarify your answer to Majors question. So will the DOJ and/or the administration comply with the deadline to supply information today?MR. SPICER: Remember, it's the -- again, it's not -- the request was made of the DOJ, and so the proper venue to ask that question of is the Department of Justice.Q  But surely, the White House knows whether there is or there is not evidence. MR. SPICER: You can't -- because, it's interesting, in the past whenever we've had these conversations with another agency, the accusation from the press corps is that we're interfering in something. So you can't have it both ways. You can't say that we're interfering with someone when we talk to them; when we don't talk to them, it's surely you must know. So --Q  So if the President tweets something --MR. SPICER: Hold on, Cecilia is asking a question.Q  -- and then say it's the Department Justice's obligation --Q  This is to follow up on --MR. SPICER: I understand that. I saw the tick-tock. I understand it. That doesnt mean you get to jump in.Cecilia.Q  So to follow up on Majors point, though, this is a tweet from the President. Doesnt the President have an obligation --MR. SPICER: And he does, and I think we've made it very --Q  -- to make the evidence clear?MR. SPICER: Right, and we've made it very clear that we expect the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees to do their job. I think theres a preponderance of reports that continues to come out about surveillance and actions that have occurred during the 2016 election. Once they come up with their report -- and it was asked earlier today -- I think we can talk about the conclusions of that report. But at this time, you can't say that we're going to shift it off to the House and Senate and then comment every day. That was the entire goal of asking them to look into this further.Q  But will DOJ comply with this deadline today? The clock is ticking.Q  The President instructed them --MR. SPICER: I understand. My understanding is that they will. But again, I would ask them what their intention is, and I believe there are certain things that they can and can't do in terms of classification and stuff. But I would leave it up to the Department of Justice to answer for the Department of Justice.Kaitlan. Q  How is the press making Obamacare look good?MR. SPICER: Well, I think when you see some of these comparisons that occur in the -- talk about whos going to win and whos going to lose, it misses a lot of the competition thats going to take place. It doesnt talk about the increased choice.Right now, as the President has noted, as Secretary Price has noted, in a third of all counties in five states you have one choice. Those analyses that are very -- trying to look at how much youll pay and how much you wont, A, dont take into consideration the competition thats going to occur, the choice thats going to occur. I mean, right now, you have one choice in a lot of places. You have no decision about how much youre going to pay and what youre going to get. Choice allows you to determine what scale of healthcare you need, what kind of package is good for you, your family or for your business. And when you look at a lot of these analyses when you open up various major papers, they make it seem so simple: its how much are you going to pay for on this plan, how much are you going to pay for under the current plan. It misses an entirety of the whole process, which is that you dont have competition, number one.Number two, and the bigger point that I think the President and a lot of others are getting to, is that the system is failing on its own. It makes it seem like its all rainbows and puppies. At the end of the day, if you have a card and youre getting a subsidy but youre not getting care, you have nothing.And so walking into a doctors office where you can hand them a card and say, Ive got a $5,000 tax subsidy -- if that doctor doesnt take the care or the deductible is so high, then you really dont have anything. And so to do an apples-to-apples comparison is hardly an accurate analysis of what the current situation is.Zeke.Q  Just going back to the counter-ISIS plan you mentioned earlier, the plan isnt dont yet. The President during the campaign said multiple times that within 30 days he wanted that plan presented to him. Obviously its undergoing comments at the National Security Council principals level. But is the President upset that he hasnt received it yet? And does that point to a difference between campaigning and governing, that things take longer than he thought?MR. SPICER: No, I think theres a difference. The plan has been received, right. The issue, as you correctly point out in your question, is that now that it becomes an aspect of the principals all discussing different priorities, different staffing levels, different funding levels. But the plan is here, as we noted a few weeks ago. Its being reviewed, and theyre providing input from different members of the principals and different members of his national security apparatus to make sure that the plan continues to evolve and is able to attack ISIS in a way that --Q  When is it actually going to take effect?MR. SPICER: Some pieces of it are, in the sense of -- he has talked to commanders on the ground. Weve noted before some of the military action thats been taken, some of the authority thats been given to some of the commanders on the ground. That is actually taking the fight to ISIS on a daily basis. I think the more holistic approach that he asked for will continue to evolve through the national security process. But make no mistake, were on it right now.Sharon.Q  Thanks, Sean. On the executive order this afternoon, do you have a numeric goal for either reducing the size of government or saving a certain amount of money through the review of agencies?MR. SPICER: I dont know that Director Mulvaney has a target, per se. I think thats part of the issue, is that you go through each one of these and you evaluate them on the merit of what they do or dont do, or whether or not theyve become bloated or duplicative, or, frankly, just outdated or in need of technological advances.But theres a lot of -- theres no set number that were driving down to as we review government. Sometimes you just walk into an agency and you realize that agencys mission is no longer relevant, or that its duplicative in three other agencies, or that there are too many people performing a function that no longer exists for a variety of reasons. But thats why the mission is critical that Director Mulvaney was given the mandate to go out and get all of these different agencies and departments to review themselves and to provide feedback for him as to where we could go.Gabi.Q  Thanks, Sean. You had said previously that the Republican healthcare plan wouldnt be a one-size-fits-all approach, but the current plan preserves Obamacares health benefits requirements, which literally defines insurance at the federal level. So how do you reconcile those two things?MR. SPICER: Whats missing right now is choice. Thats the number-one issue. We tried to solve a problem -- when I say we, the government -- with respect to Obamacare back in 2008, 2009. And the issue was, is that in order to solve a problem for several million people being without healthcare insurance, we upended the system for everybody -- so if you had employer-based healthcare, if you had TRICARE, Medicare or Medicaid. And it was exactly the opposite approach. We went in to solve a problem that a small fraction of Americans had, and we upended the entire system, forcing premiums to go up and choice to go down for everybody. And I think that when you can institute choice and competition back in the system, thats something thats going to benefit everybody. And thats exactly the opposite of whats happening.Q  Would phase two or three of this eliminate those requirements?MR. SPICER: I think phase two, the administrative phase, will look at a lot of those requirements, and then phase three -- and again, theyre not necessarily -- they can run concurrently, and I think the House is looking at starting a lot of that legislation.And so -- and Dr. Price is already starting to look through a lot of that administration -- a lot of administrative aspects of it as well at HHS and figure out how do we start to achieve some of this, unravel some of these pieces that are there, but instilling choice and competition, allowing people to buy their insurance over state lines, allowing small businesses to pool, allowing the expansion of health savings accounts -- all of those kind of factors that are going to drive down costs, but also having the insurance companies, frankly, be able to offer additional choices and options for people is in itself going to be a huge bonus.Charlie.Q  A lot of conservatives are complaining that -- or suggesting that the President doesnt fully back the Paul Ryan healthcare plan. Has the President spoken with Paul Ryan about the plan? And have they had any conversations about its future in Congress?MR. SPICER: They have spoken, yes. I dont know when the last time they have. But the President is fully committed to this plan. I think you saw Secretary Price and Director Mulvaney out discussing that this weekend. Theyre committed to the plan.And, look, Director Mulvaney made it very clear this weekend as well that if through the process we can find some ideas that make this a stronger, more patient-centered piece of legislation that will ultimately benefit Americans, then were going to do it. Were not saying this is the only way forward. As it works its way through the House and then ultimately through the Senate, if there are ways that we can enhance the bill through the legislative process, were willing to do that.Peter.Q  You want to read us another -- quickly -- if there's any details of the --MR. SPICER: Would you like to know? (Laughter.)Q  Yes.MR. SPICER: Okay, thank you. The President spoke to the Chancellor of Germany. They agreed, due to the current weather, that the meeting should be postponed. The meeting has been rescheduled to March 17th, this Friday. Same schedule of events on March 17th. Q  All right, Ill ask my question if I can very quickly then. MR. SPICER: Thank you for your assistance with the --Q  Thats news. You spoke on behalf of the President, quoting him on the jobs report on Friday. You said they may have been phony in the past, but its very real now. MR. SPICER: They are very real now.Q  They are very real now.""MR. SPICER: Just want to make sure you get it right. Q  The question I wanted -- when should Americans trust the President? Should they trust the President -- is it phony or real when he says that President Obama was wiretapping him?MR. SPICER: Well, again, lets get back. I think theres two things that are important about what he said. I think recognizing that its -- he doesnt really think that President Obama went up and tapped his phone personally.Q  What does he think?MR. SPICER: But I think theres no question that the Obama administration, that there were actions about surveillance and other activities that occurred in the 2016 election. That is a widely reported activity that occurred back then. The President used the word wiretap to mean, broadly, surveillance and other activities during that. And that is, again, something -- it is interesting how many news outlets reported that this activity was taking place during the 2016 election cycle, and now were wondering where the proof is. It is many of the same outlets in this room that talked about the activities that were going on back then.Q  So on the same topic, on the CBO report, did the President think it was real then, and is phony now?MR. SPICER: What CBO report?Q  On the expectation -- the CBO report is coming out, about which you said, If youre looking at the CBO for accuracy, youre looking in the wrong place. Three years ago, you said of the CBO report, that it confirms Obamacare is bad for the economy. So the question is --MR. SPICER: Well, it was bad for the economy.Q  Okay, so the bottom line of the question is, was it real then, and now is now phony? As you have said, its not the place to find accuracy?MR. SPICER: Okay, so lets look at the CBOs projection. It said their projection on Obamacare was that, in 2016, it would have 24 million people on it. The actual figure is 10.4 million people -- less than half the number of people that it predicted would be insured were on it, and its declining.So the only point, Peter, is to make sure that people understand -- if youre looking to get a bullseye accurate prediction as to where its going, the CBO was off by more than half last time. So its not -- this is not about what my understanding or my belief of the CBO is. The last time they did this they were wildly off, and the number keeps declining. And so the question that needs to get asked right now, or, frankly, the awareness that needs to be brought up right now is that if you were going to look at a number tonight, I think you have to look through the scope of whether or not that number is.Now, it was bad for the economy. That was right. You can glean that in terms of the direction what the impact that it had. But as far as their numbers go -- on the number of people that they predicted back then would be covered now -- they were off by more than half.Q  I guess the question is, when can we trust the President when he says something is phony and when he says its real?MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. You asked a question about CBO, and now youre conflating it with the question of the President. The question is --Q  No, I asked a question about wiretapping first. And then we went on to CBO. So the question, in simple terms is, when he says something, can we trust that its real --MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  -- or should we assume that its phony? Well, no, no --MR. SPICER: You suggest that its real, absolutely.Q  How can we believe that its real when you just told us that it was phony then, but now its real?MR. SPICER: I did not tell you that, Peter. And youre trying --Q  You told us on Friday that the President said -- the President, you didnt -- the President said the numbers were phony then but theyre very real now. So how can we take anything he says that he wont later say, ""actually it was the opposite""?MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on. I think the difference is, the President was talking then and now about job creation -- the number of jobs. The issue that he brought up in the quote that youre talking about was the percentage of people who are unemployed. And there is no question that no matter how you look at this, whether you talk about 4.7 or 4.8 or whatever the number is, that number fluctuates by how people calculate who is in the workforce.Q  He said it was in the twenties or more. MR. SPICER: Okay, Peter, let me answer the question.Q  Im listening.MR. SPICER: Youre not. Let me answer it. The bottom line is, the percentage of people who are unemployed varies widely by who youre asking and the way you do the analysis of who is actually in the workforce. The number of people who are working and receiving a paycheck is a number that we can look at.Secondly, when youre asking about the validity of the CBO report, again, I would refer you to the CBO itself. The number that they issued that would be insured in 2016 was 26 million people. The actual number is 10 -- excuse me, 24 million. The actual number is 10.4. Thats not a question of our credibility. Its a question of theirs.Do you have anything more? (Laughter.)Q  The bottom line is, the question that you still have not answered is --MR. SPICER: I have answered it.Q  -- can you say affirmatively that whenever the President says something, we can trust it to be real?MR. SPICER: If hes not joking, of course. But in that case --Q  So let's start over again with joking.MR. SPICER: But you're asking -- hold on -- okay, no, no. But your point is -- I mean, every time that he speaks authoritatively -- that he speaks -- that he is speaking as President of the United States. Like its --Q  Three to five -- more than 3 million Americans voted illegally -- was that, when he was speaking --MR. SPICER: Yes. And he still believes that.Q  -- was he joking or does he believe it?MR. SPICER: He does believe it. Thank you.Julie.Q  Thanks, Sean. I have a healthcare question. But first, can we just get an answer one way or the other about whether the President directed the Department of Justice to respond to this?MR. SPICER: No, he did not.Q  And does he plan to?MR. SPICER: I answered the question.Q  Okay, so on healthcare, Secretary Price said on Sunday that nobody will be worse off financially and more people will be covered than are currently with the plan that you guys are pushing. Paul Ryan acknowledged that people are going to lose coverage. So what is the goal here? You just said youre open to modifications to the plan if you find that theres a better way to do it. Is the goal that people not lose coverage? Or is the goal that --MR. SPICER: Well, again -- but theres a false argument there which is that they have coverage. People have cards, theyve been told they have things, but they cant -- they keep walking in -- the President met with nine individuals this morning that they were told theyre going to get coverage for something, they are told that theyre going to have all these subsidies. They walk in, and they dont get covered. They dont have the care that they need. There is a difference between walking around with someone and saying, hey, Ive got a card, than I have care. And that is a big, big difference. Right now, when you have a third of the counties in this country that have one choice and going down, and number of insurers leaving markets, then the system is collapsing. So the question has to be, to everybody who is not with us on this, is what is your alternative? Because right now, the current system of Obamacare is failing every American who has Obamacare. And frankly, for those who dont have Obamacare, for those who have employer-based insurance, for those who have TRICARE or Medicare, its driving up the costs. And in the cases, especially for those who have Medicaid, Medicare, or TRICEARE, theyre going into doctors offices more and more who are telling them, we dont accept that.Q  But youre talking about quality and about cost. Im asking about coverage.MR. SPICER: Yeah, but thats the point, is that youre missing the point. If you keep talking about coverage -- care is what matters. If you cant walk in and get seen, if you cant get a doctor to see you, then you dont have coverage. I mean, thats what this is all about. Being told you have coverage but you cant go see a doctor, or you cant afford to see a doctor is not coverage.John Gizzi.MR. SPICER: Thank you, Sean. I have two questions. First, Democratic Leader Pelosi said on Friday that every single Democrat would vote against the American healthcare plan -- the plan backed by Republican members of Congress and the administration. The Freedom Caucus in the House has come out for Senator Pauls plan. When one simply does the arithmetic of Democratic members and Freedom Caucus members, thats a majority against the plan. How does the administration plan to overcome the arithmetic?MR. SPICER: We're going to continue to work with members of the House and then eventually the Senate. I feel very good, as the President continues to engage with members, that we will have the votes necessary. I think Speaker Ryan agrees with that as well. We're going to have the votes, this thing will pass, and we'll move on to the Senate.Q  The other question is this: In recent weeks theres been considerable attention on the upcoming elections in the Netherlands on Wednesday, and in France in a few weeks. Candidate Geert Wilders of the Netherlands was here for the CPAC conference. Representatives of Marine Le Pen of France were here. Many analogies were made between these candidates and President Trump, and they offered words of praise for him or did so through their representatives. Is he aware of these candidates in Europe who invoke his name and image? And if so, what does he think of these would-be Trumps and Trumpettes?MR. SPICER: I don't know the answer to that. I think most of these are -- we'll allow sovereign nations to have their own elections without interference.Alexis.Q  Sean, can I follow up on Peter and Julie's questions?MR. SPICER: Sure.Q  Two issues, again. Whether the President and Director Mulvaney put a lot of faith in the Congressional Budget Office, members of the Senate will, when they get -- if they get legislation from the House. So my question is, what does the President or the administration intend to do to establish to senators satisfaction that the numbers coming out of the Congressional Budget Office, which the President will question, are not substantial and can be countered by other information? In other words, is OMB doing its own kind of score? Is the President relying on a think tank to counter the messaging? Because senators are already indicating that they will put weight in the CBOs score.MR. SPICER: And again, I think this is part of an ongoing discussion with members as far as philosophical, what do they believe, and a lot of these aspects of this plan in keeping with what they have supported in the past.Obviously, theyre going to look at the score -- I get it. That's part of it. And there are pieces of it that may historically have more weighted than others. But I think this is going to be -- as I mentioned to John, I mean, it's an ongoing conversation with members of the House and ultimately the Senate with respect to whatever comes out.But in the same way that members relied on the score last time, they were way off. And I think that we have to remind them that if this is what you're basing your vote on, you have to look at the historical context in which that information was provided. I think that's an important aspect to how they do it. But I think theres going to be a ton of factors that people rely on as they do this.Q  Can I follow -- I have one follow-up.MR. SPICER: Of course.Q  I may be confused about the wiretapping, your answers, in terms of the Presidents response. The President was the one who tweeted this, right, and said that he learned something. So can you just establish for me, because I'm confused, the President did discuss what it is that he had in mind, what he tweeted, with the Department of Justice before the Department 00MR. SPICER: No, I'm not going to get into what the President knew or didnt know prior to it. I think we've already commented on this multiple times.Q  But how would the Department of Justice have any idea --MR. SPICER: I don't know. This was a request made of the House Intelligence Committee, not to us. So I don't want to get into starting to parse what we knew or what we didnt. That request did not come to us, it went to the Department of Justice.Yes.Q  Congressman Steve King (inaudible) a tweet he put up, saying that, ""We cant restore civilization with somebody else's babies."" Does the White House have any reaction to that?MR. SPICER: I will definitely touch base with the President on that and get back to you on that.Hallie.Q  Sean, two for you. I just want to go back to something. You just said a minute ago that ""what the President meant when he tweeted about the wiretapping was"" -- and you sort of explained it. But youve also stood at that podium and said the tweet speaks for itself. When do you decide when a Presidents tweets, when his words are open to interpretation and when those words stand on their own?MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, can you further explain what you're asking? I mean, his tweets do speak for themselves.Q  You just sort of interpreted it for Peter, saying, well, he didnt mean that President Obama had --MR. SPICER: That's not what I said. No, no, actually --Q  You said when he meant wiretapping -- said it -- he meant surveillance. That's not what he said.MR. SPICER: He literally had it in quotes.Q  So you're interpreting the tweet for us, it sounds like.MR. SPICER: No, in some cases I'll ask him, what did the quotes mean, and he'll say --Q  Did you ask about this tweet?MR. SPICER: I did.Q  And what did he say?MR. SPICER: He said they were in quotes, I was referring to surveillance overall. It's something that had been referred to in other reports. Q  So he cited other reports in his conversation with you?MR. SPICER: He did, yes.Q  So was that what he was basing that tweet on?MR. SPICER: As I just mentioned -- it was a good try, but I've already been clear on that.Q  I have a second for you, Sean. I want to go back to this healthcare idea. Just yes or no: Are CBO numbers legitimate, or not?MR. SPICER: That's not my determination to make. I'm telling --Q  Does the President think those numbers are legitimate?MR. SPICER: Hallie, it depends. There are a lot of things at -- hold on, Hallie. You guys have like an NBC thing. Let me answer the question. I think when you look at whatever that number is, whether it's budget projections or whatever, I think theres a track record that goes along a lot of times with whether or not the projections in certain areas -- whether it's unemployment, budgetary numbers, whatever -- what the track record is.All I'm suggesting to you is very clearly that the numbers that they gave the last time they did health care were off by more than 50 percent when it came to the number of people insured. That's not my interpretation, that's a fact. And I think it's important for people to understand the differences.Eamon.Q  Sean, on Preet Bharara, I guess there are two possibilities here. One is the President made a commitment to keep him back in November, and the other one is that he didnt. Preet Bharara came down to the lobby of Trump Tower and said that the President had made that commitment. Did the President, in fact, make that commitment to Preet Bharara?MR. SPICER: I don't think it really matters. At the end of the day, the Attorney General followed a practice that existed for the last several administrations and asked every attorney general in the last administration to submit their resignation. So, I mean, it is --Q  It matters in ongoing investigations, and it also matters in the sense that the President made a commitment. If he made a commitment, why did he change his mind? Why did he go back on it?MR. SPICER: Well, again, as I mentioned earlier, he called him to thank him for his service last week. He followed in the past practice of last several administration and asked everybody to step down. And I think that's the appropriate thing. Q  Sean, but whats changed from November to now?MR. SPICER: I called on someone.Q  Sean, thank you. Ronica Cleary from Fox 5, thank you. I have two questions. The first, I think especially in light of what has happened in the room here today, the President tweeted this morning that much of the media is being rude and that we should be nice. So my question is, is it our job to be nice? And do you think we're nice? (Laughter.) MR. SPICER:  Thank you, Ronica. I will just leave it at this. I think that I've been asked for my personal opinion several times. That's not my job. I don't get up here to speak for myself. I speak for the President. I think that he has been very clear that he doesnt believe some of the behavior and the reporting has been appropriate. And to Hallies point, I will let the tweet speak for itself.Ronica, number two.Q  Second question. But this is about you. The interaction you had at the Apple store this weekend -- what would be, I guess, your message to individuals who want to maybe -- I see that woman was, you could argue, very aggressive. If somebody doesnt want to be aggressive and has a question for you, what would you be your kind of message to a regular citizen that has an issue?MR. SPICER: Ask it. I interact with individuals all day long. Ninety-nine percent of them are pleasant, even with people who may not agree with our philosophy or programs or whatever. But it's a free country, and the beauty of it is that people can act how they want, no matter how that's interpreted. And as long as they stay on the right side of the First Amendment, we're good.Francesca.Q  Thank you, Sean. You said that when the President said wiretapping in that tweet he meant a whole host of surveillance types. So that we can be crystal clear, what surveillance types was he referring to then? What would you consider part of that range?MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think theres a whole host of tactics that can be used to monitor somebody -- either through wiretap or other ways in which you can surveil somebody.Q  We took that to mean monitoring his calls, specifically. So what else would you include in that range?MR. SPICER: I think theres a whole host of things that fall into that category. So I'm not sure how you took it, but there is a wide range of ways in which somebody can be monitored or followed up on. And I think that if you contacted one of the law enforcement agencies, they will provide you with a whole host of ways.Thank you, all. Be safe tomorrow with the snow. Thank you very much. Take care.

329,2017-03-14,Remarks by the Vice President and CMS Administrator Verma at a Swearing-in Ceremony,"Vice Presidents Ceremonial Office3:49 P.M. EDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon. On behalf of the President of the United States, it is my great privilege to administer the oath of office to Seema Verma, who will become the 15th Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. You can applaud that if you want. I can tell youd like to. (Applause.) I'm very pleased today to be joined, despite the inclement weather, by her wonderful family, including her husband, Sanjay; her daughter, Maya; her son, Sean. And we're also pleased that her mother, Denash (ph), and her sister, Dia (ph) are here. Join me in welcoming Seema Vermas entire family. (Applause.) My friends, we've come to a critical moment in the life of our nation -- seven years ago, this month, the failed law known as Obamacare was signed into law. And it's proved to be a disaster. Its damage to our economy and our people literally grows with every passing year. We've all seen the headlines -- rising premiums, plummeting choices. Obamacare is collapsing, and the American people know it. The fact is that Obamacare has failed and Obamacare must go.President Trump has made clear hes promised to repeal and replace Obamacare once and for all with a better health care system, one that will benefit the health and well-being of the American people for generations to come. And, my friends, we're already in the process of keeping that promise. At this very moment, our administration is pursuing a multistep strategy to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something that actually works.Step one, we're working with the Congress to pass the American Health Care Act, which begins the process of repealing and replacing Obamacare by ending its taxes and penalties, expanding the use of health savings accounts -- and just to name a few of the important reforms that are in it.At the same time, our Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, is already taking steps to get government out of the way to lower prices and increase choices for Americans. And we're working with Congress to pass legislation later this year that will create a dynamic national health insurance marketplace that will make affordable, high-quality health insurance accessible for every American. Allowing Americans to buy health insurance across state lines is an idea whose time has come.At each step of this process, one of President Trumps most important objectives, though, has been to give the freedom and flexibility to states across the country to design health care programs, especially Medicaid, to the unique needs of their most vulnerable citizens. And that's where Seema Verma comes in. President Trump has chosen, frankly, one of the leading experts in America on state-based health care solutions to lead this important agency. Seemas extraordinary record stretches back for over 20 years. After graduating from Johns Hopkins University with a masters degree in public health, she went to work in the great state of Indiana for the Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County.She also worked for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials before founding her own health care company in 2001. And that's where she has really made her mark across the country. In my home state of Indiana, she helped design the much-heralded Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 in 2015. Today, Indianas program is leading the nation with its emphasis on personal responsibility and effective care for people who need it most.And beyond Indiana, shes helped states like Iowa, Ohio, Kentucky, and Michigan seek to update their programs to better reflect the unique needs of those states. Seema, President Trump has now asked you to bring your expertise to Washington, D.C. As Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, we're confident that youll help restore health care decision-making to the states, and in the process, help make the best health care system in the world even better. And frankly, as a fellow Hoosier, I couldn't be more proud. Given your strong record of leadership, experience, and compassion, I can say with full confidence, along with the President, that we know you will rise to the challenge to help make American health care great again.And so, on behalf of President Trump, it's my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office. (The oath is administered.) (Applause.)Ladies and gentlemen, it's my privilege to introduce the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Seema Verma. (Applause.) ADMINISTRATOR VERMA: Thank you. First of all, I want to thank my family for being here tonight -- or today. Their flight was cancelled last night, and they drove through a snowstorm just to be here with me. So I'm very, very grateful. (Applause.)I am humbled and honored to be here today and to have the opportunity to serve as the CMS Administrator. I'm grateful and appreciative of President Trump not only for asking me to be the Administrator but for putting together an incredibly talented group of individuals that hes brought from the private sector into government service. People like Dr. Tom Price. And I am proud to be a part of this team.And thank you to my good friend, Vice President Pence, for believing in me and for all of your support these past years. Your leadership in Indiana is paving the way for all states, and the future of health care in America. So, thank you.And thanks to all of you that have been involved in my confirmation process. Many of you have gone above and beyond to help me navigate the process, and I am so grateful for your support.Today, our health care stands at a crossroads and we have no choice but to fix our health care system. Under President Trumps leadership and vision, we finally have an incredible opportunity to move our health care system into one that puts Americans in charge of their health care and will ensure that all Americans have access to quality health care that they can afford.I am honored to be a part of this critical effort. We have so much work to get done, and I can't wait to begin. Thank you very much. (Applause.)END3:58 P.M. EDT",20837.37,-44.11000000000058,5856.82,-18.960000000000036,2365.45,-8.019999999999982

331,2017-03-14,ICYMI: Trump Budget Expected To Seek Historic Contraction Of Federal Workforce,"Simply put, government would be smaller and less involved in regulating life in America, with private companies and states playing a much bigger role.Trump budget expected to seek historic contraction of federal workforceWashington PostBy Damian PalettaPresident Trumps budget proposal this week would shake the federal government to its core if enacted, culling back numerous programs and expediting a historic contraction of the federal workforce.The spending budget Trump is set to release Thursday will offer the clearest snapshot of his vision for the size and role of government. Aides say that the president sees a new Washington emerging from the budget process, one that prioritizes the military and homeland security while slashing many other areas, including housing, foreign assistance, environmental programs, public broadcasting and research. Simply put, government would be smaller and less involved in regulating life in America, with private companies and states playing a much bigger role.Unfortunately, we have no alternative but to reinvest in our military and make ourselves a military power once again, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn said on Fox News Sunday.If youre doing that in an area where you have to balance the budget and you cannot create a further deficit, you have to make cuts. Its no different than every other family in America that has to make the tough decisions when they need to spend money somewhere, they have to cut it from somewhere else.The federal government is projected to spend $4.091 trillion next year, with roughly two-thirds of that going mostly toward Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, poverty assistance and interest payments on the government debt. This spending is expected to be left untouched in the budget proposal next week.What Trump will propose changing is the rest of the budget, known as discretionary spending, which is authorized each year by Congress. Slightly more than half of this remaining money goes to the military, and the rest is spread across agencies that operate things like education, diplomacy, housing, transportation and law enforcement.Among Trumps expected proposals are an increase in military spending of $54 billion, more money to start building a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico, and the creation of new initiatives that expand access to charter schools and other educational programs.Trump and his advisers have said that they believe the federal workforce is too big, and that the federal government spends  and wastes  too much money. They have said that Washington  the federal workers and contractors, among others  has benefited from government largesse while many other Americans have suffered. Federal spending, they have argued, crowds the private sector and piles regulations and bureaucracy onto companies.Trumps chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, has said Trump will lead a deconstruction of the administrative state. On Friday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Obama loyalists had burrowed into government. Last month, Trump said the government would have to do more with less.Trumps proposal comes at a time when the federal budget is facing massive structural shifts in society and the economy. Aging baby boomers are swelling the number of Americans collecting Social Security and Medicare benefits, and the costs of these programs will continue to grow faster for more than a decade, budget experts said. In addition, the expected rise in borrowing rates and the growing national debt are expected to push interest payments on the debt from $270 billion this year to $768 billion in 2027, outpacing any growth in tax revenue.Mick Mulvaney, head of the Office of Management and Budget, said on Hugh Hewitts radio program last week that it was important for the administration to change how Washington thinks.We dont solve problems by simply throwing money at them, he said.Read the entire article here.",20837.37,-44.11000000000058,5856.82,-18.960000000000036,2365.45,-8.019999999999982

Mayor Bowser and Metro general manager Wiedefeld about the preparations for the storm. The President continues to closely monitor the impact of the storm throughout the Northeast. The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs has been in touch with state and local officials in the path of the storm to provide them guidance and support. As the storm continues to track the East Coast, heavy to intense snow, sleet, and strong winds could result in significant travel impacts and possible coastal flooding. Again, the President encourages everyone to listen to their state and local leaders and public safety officers, and follow their warnings and closure notices. They are working around the clock to ensure the safety of our citizens and their families.In light of the storm, the schedule for today changed a bit. Obviously, German Chancellor Merkel's visit was moved to Friday. We'll continue to provide you updates on the schedule as we grow closer to Friday.Today, the President had lunch with the Deputy Crown Prince and Minister of Defense of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This afternoon, the President will swear in Seema Verma as the Administrator of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The President looks forward to having the spectacularly qualified and experienced Administrator Verma finally onboard, especially as we continue to lay the groundwork for historic reform of our healthcare system.Later this afternoon, the President and Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, will have a call with the CEO of Anthem Healthcare, Mr. Joseph Swedish. He will then have a phone call with Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader McCarthy to further discuss the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with the American Health Care Act and a series of much-needed regulatory reforms to accompany that.The President was glad to see the National Federation of Independent Businesses announce their support for the American Health Care Act, and FIB has previously identified healthcare along with small business taxes as their two biggest priorities, and the President's healthcare agenda will address many of their concerns for small businesses. Yesterday, of course, the Congressional Budget Office released their report on the American Health Care Act. I know that there have been significant concerns about the CBO report, and I want to give a little bit of context to the numbers that have been going around.In 2013, the CBO estimated that 24 million people would have coverage under Obamacare in 2016. They were way off. They were off by 13 million people -- over 50 percent. In fact, only 10.4 million people were actually covered. Reports now suggest that that number has dwindled down to 9 million. CBO coverage estimates are consistently wrong and, more importantly, did not take into consideration the comprehensive nature of the three-pronged plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with the American Health Care Act.We're working to bring real relief and better choices to the American family. The two other prongs of our plan contain several additional reforms that will further drive down cost and increase coverage. When you get down to it, the Congressional Budget Office is there to measure the potential impact of programs on the federal budget. Its attempts to estimate coverage have been historically faulty. But in the portion of its analysis that focuses on what the office is really about, the CBO concedes that the American Health Care Act would actually reduce the deficit by over $330 billion and bring health insurance premiums down 10 percent, even before many of the significant reforms in prongs two and three have taken effect. And as I've mentioned before, some of these include expanding healthcare savings accounts, streamlining the process at FDA so that innovative and lower-cost medicines can get to patients faster, allowing health insurance to be sold across state lines, which increases competition and decreases cost, permitting small businesses to band together to negotiate healthcare rates for all of their employees, and reforming the medical malpractice system so that doctors arent spending their time and patients' money on unnecessary procedures.Beyond the numbers, let's talk about some real-life examples of the cost of Obamacare for some actual Americans who the President heard from during his listening session yesterday. Kim Sertich, a small-business owner in Arizona, had her healthcare cost skyrocket from $389.79 a month to $809.15. Carrie Couey from Colorado, a mother of six whose youngest son is autistic, saw her family's yearly insurance go from $1,700* [$17,000] to $52,000 for a lower-quality plan. And Joel Brown, a farmer from Tennessee, saw his catastrophic coverage cost spike in the wake of Obamacare from $119 a month to more than $500 per month. These are the stories that really matter to millions of Americans who are suffering under Obamacare, and these are the stories that are at the top of the President's mind as he works towards reforming our healthcare system. The President is committed to working together with Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, and Majority Leader McConnell to create a system that's affordable and accessible to all Americans. Let me walk through the rest of the schedule for the week. Tomorrow, the President is headed to Michigan to meet with auto executives and workers, and will discuss how his plans for rolling back federal red tape will lead to more American jobs and higher wages, specifically in the automobile sector. It's a great opportunity for the President to showcase moves he's already made towards these ambitious ""Buy American, Hire American"" agenda, like encouraging investment and workforce training and developments so that Americans are ready for the jobs of the future, and removing the roadblocks that prevent American businesses from staying and expanding here in the United States. The President hopes to build on the great optimism that he's built within the business community in anticipation of the renewed opportunities the President's economic agenda has already created. He and his team are hard at work to produce the results that the American people deserve and voted for last year. He will also travel to Nashville, Tennessee, where he will lay a wreath at President Andrew Jackson's tomb on his 250th birthday. Thursday, the Taoiseach of Ireland Kenny will come to the White House for the traditional St. Patrick's Day visit, including a reception in honor of the Taoiseach and Mrs. Kenny. And as I mentioned, German Chancellor Merkel's visit will resume on Friday, and we will have an update on that schedule.With that, I'm glad to take a few questions.Q  Sean, President Trump has said that under his plan there will be insurance for everybody. How do you square that with the CBO numbers? And is that a promise he can really keep?MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's two issues that are important to note on that, Katherine. Number one, more and more Americans have no choices, so they don't have insurance. I've mentioned this before. Having a card and having coverage that when you walk into a doctors office has a deductible of $15,000, $20,000 a year isn't coverage. That's a card. That doesnt get you the care you need. That doesnt allow you to get the procedure or the referral that you need from a doctor that's telling you what you need to have happen.That's vastly different than what we hope to exist, which is giving people who don't have it -- and lets kind of -- I think it's important to add some context to this. If you think about the individual market that exists right now, the individual insurance market, youve got roughly 30 million people that exist right now -- 9 million people now are on the exchange. That number has gone down; 6.5 million people have said they don't want any insurance and theyre going to pay a penalty, and then just under 14 million people have said that they have applied for a hardship. So youve got almost 20 million people in America who have said that they don't want Obamacare and theyll either pay a penalty or will apply for a hardship.Those are people who don't have it to begin with. The exchanges sought out to cover these people, and we're finding out that youve got 9 million-plus who are getting it right now. They have no coverage. And for more and more Americans, theyre losing their coverage, their choices are gone. Tax credits in competition that will come in phases two and three in the prongs that we talked about will further drop prices down, will further increase competition.The CBO score didnt take into consideration in that. And again, if you look at their numbers, youve got roughly just over 9 million people on the exchanges. The CBO number says that 14 million people in the first year alone will lose coverage. It doesnt take a ton of analysis to recognize that that doesnt make any sense logically. You can't only have 9-plus million people on the exchange and say in the first year alone, when theres no touch to Medicaid or anything else, you're just removing the individual mandate that forced people to buy something that they didnt want in the first place, that is going to lead to 14 million people -- that people are going to drop off Medicare, theyre not going to take their employer -- that just doesnt add up. In fact, I would argue that if you look at the other part of the equation, the 20 million-plus people who have either chosen to pay a penalty -- you think about that -- the 6.5 million people are saying either the plan is too costly, the plan doesnt provide coverage. I think a lot of those people, especially when we continue to instill additional coverage, they have more choices, they can pick a plan that actually fits their needs or fits their budget, you're going to see more people want coverage who are going to choose coverage. So I think that the CBO number, A, they have a record that doesnt match up with the ability to count people. Theyre pretty good at dollars, not as good at people. And I think that when you look at the additional phases or prongs of this whole comprehensive approach, that actually changes the equation a lot. Its looking at one piece of a three-part plan, and that's not the entirety of the plan that we're looking at. So that doesnt --Q  So what does the White House think the change will be next year?MR. SPICER: Well, again, I don't think that we -- we don't do those projections. But I think that theres no question, when you look at the cost, theyre already saying just this alone, just doing the first prong of this will take costs down 10 percent in the individual market. If you think about it, theyre up 25 percent in the individual market on average already. This year alone, on just people who are on the exchanges, up 25 percent. The CBO is saying, just with what we're doing on the first prong alone, 10 percent decline in the individual market. That's a significant reduction.That's what we're talking about. Bringing costs down, it increases choices. That's a big deal right now. The problem that you have currently is that these subsidies that people get get them a card that doesnt get them care. And that's what we need to start focusing on, is how many people are actually getting the care they need to deal with the medical concerns of them or their family. And that's not whats happening.Mike.Q  Sean, stating as you did that the primary objection of this White House is that the CBO report doesnt take into account phase two and phase three, are there specifics either in terms of the specific regulatory reforms that the White House is considering and the specific terms of the legislation that you would offer that are out there for people to study as part of this? Because as you surely know, Tom Cotton among others are skeptical of whether these phases can actually --MR. SPICER: Look, the things that I mentioned earlier -- allowing people to buy across state lines, to pool their insurance, to expand HSAs, to reform the FDA -- all of those things I think unquestionably add competition and choice. Theres no question about it. If one plan can sell that was in Maryland, into Virginia, where they can seek additional customers, that competition alone invariably brings down costs. And we've seen this in market after market where once you allow competition, by itself, that will bring down costs. It will bring in choice.Right now these insurance who have been mandated by the government to create certain packages that people don't need, youve got young people that are being told to buy packages that have end-of-life care that they don't necessarily need. Youve got people who are in their older phases having to buy stuff for maternity that may not be a service that they need at their stage of life. But the problem is that the government got involved in health care and started dictating what needed to happen instead of allowing the choice and allow people to buy a plan that actually was tailored to the needs that they want.Those reforms in themselves unquestionably bring down cost. Theres no question. But I think one of the issues that has to go back to overriding this issue -- and the President has stated this on numerous occasions -- if we do nothing, if we just allow this to continue, it will collapse on its own. The cost of it is unsustainable. The premiums are going sky-high in state after state. And the choices keep going further and further down.And so this idea of comparing it to Obamacare is a false choice because they have no choice. The choice is going away and the cost continues to get higher through every phase. And so to assume that the comparison is apples to apples is a false choice. Q  I'm not making that. But youve been critical from this podium of the Obama administration, of Democrats, in the way they went about passing the Affordable Care Act. In the interest of transparency that you accused them of not following, of shoving it down peoples throat, shouldnt the White House, should HHS put those details out now? Should they put the legislative details out and the subsequent steps in phase three?MR. SPICER: I think the House is working on that in a lot of cases. And as that legislation gets done --Q  -- put the cards on the table now, because there's a lot of skepticism --MR. SPICER: I think that's a great question for Speaker Ryan, and I know that hes been working with a team in getting it done. And I think the sooner that we can get all those prongs out there, the better. I agree with you. But I think the big difference, just so we're clear, is that we posted this bill online, the Speaker had it out there, the President tweeted it out. Anyone in the country and anyone in the world, could read it. That's a vastly different approach than after it's being done, told, after we pass it you can read it, which is what Speaker Pelosi said.Q  Does the White House encourage Republicans to put details of the phase three legislation out there now?MR. SPICER: I mean, sure. The more that can get out there on those phases, absolutely. And I know the Speaker is working with his members to do that. But I think that's an appropriate question for the Speaker to answer, not for me. I know that we are trying to work with them. I know that theres a lot of members that are working with Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy and, frankly, on the other chamber as well. But I think that we continue -- and that's why I think we're talking about all of those prongs and all the pieces of them so that we can start making sure that people understand the comprehensive nature of this.Q  Will that happen before theres a vote on the --MR. SPICER: I think that's a question for Speaker Ryan to answer. I think the more we can get out there the better, though.Alexis.Q  Can I follow up on what Mike was asking about Senator Cotton? Why is the White House giving Senator Cotton full running room to go again and again in the media and to denigrate the House plan without bringing him in, discussing with him what Mike was just bringing up -- alternatives that hes suggesting? Why does he have special dispensation to go out?MR. SPICER: I don't think he has special dispensation. It's a free country; he can say what he wants.Q  But if you brought him in here --MR. SPICER: No, I think our team has been working with his team as they are with Senator Pauls team and anyone else who has ideas. We've been engaged in a very, very robust discussion with members in both chambers who have ideas to move this thing forward. I don't think we are able to tell people what they can and cannot engage in a free society. And Senator Cotton is obviously able to make any comments that hed like. Wed obviously continue to like to work with him. And I think the team will continue to reach out to both he and his team to try to get his ideas on this.Q  But the President spent time talking to him about his ideas on immigration. Has he called him? Has the Vice President called Senator Cotton?MR. SPICER: I know that we've had a very, very robust discussion with members of the House and Senate. I would have to get specific details of what we've done with specifically Senator Cotton.Q  Is Senator Cruz coming today?MR. SPICER: I believe he -- I'd have to check on that. I know that there was a group of individuals. I don't have that list in front of me.Q  Senators?MR. SPICER: I will get back to you on that, Alexis, I promise. The snowstorm kind of shifted a bunch of stuff up, so I don't want to start getting in front of who actually can be here and who can't. But I will make sure that we get those details out and we have --Q  Can you get it to the pool?MR. SPICER: I'd be glad to get it to the entire pool.Q  Thank you.MR. SPICER: Margaret.Q  Thank you. So still on the same subject. Does the White House support the House bill as it is, or amending it? And theres been reporting that the White House is involved, or some White House officials are involved in shaping what's being described as like a major or significant managers amendment in conjunction with conservatives. Can you tell --MR. SPICER: I would -- I'm sorry, please finish. Q  No, we can go back and forth. But I'm just wondering, can you -- is the White House writing this amendment or just considering backing the amendment? And does Paul Ryan know about it? We can tell him about it right now, I guess.MR. SPICER: I think Speaker Ryan is well aware of the managers amendment. I think as we've noted multiple times from the podium, when people have ideas that are constructive or supportive, or ones that we have heard about from different members that we have engaged with, and, frankly, ones that the House and Senate has engaged with who shared ideas, weve always stated a willingness. Director Mulvaney has talked about it, Secretary Price, the President himself, the Vice President.Part of the reason we're engaging with these individuals is to hear their ideas, to talk to them about not just the content but the approach -- what can go in, what can go out, how we deal with the different phases, as Mike was asking, and when we go. But all of that is part of a comprehensive strategy to engage with members who support us, who have ideas and want to be onboard, who want to be constructive in the process and achieve the Presidents goal of having a patient-centric healthcare system.So we are obviously in talks with House leadership about the contents. But as I mentioned, the President will be on the phone with Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy later this afternoon to talk to them about some of these ideas and some of the path forward. But that's part of the legislative process.Q  So all this -- actually, I have a second question. But just to clarify this, so this involves -- the White House is working to help shape that manager's amendment? MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Okay. And on the visit of the Deputy Saudi Crown Prince today, can you talk us through a little bit more detail? Does that involve the resumption of arms sales? Is that about oil? MR. SPICER: It literally was wrapping up as we were walking over here, so I want to make sure that I get a readout. Well provide that to the pool, as we do with all the leader visits. So I will have more details from that once -- they were concluding that visit as we were coming here, and so Ill make sure I get it.Blake.Q  Thanks, Sean. In the middle of all this, there is also the debt ceiling. MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q  How urgent of a priority is this? And how concerned is the administration in tackling this, given the letter that Secretary Mnuchin sent out last week?MR. SPICER: Yeah, so Secretary Mnuchin sent a letter noting that, under the Budget Reconciliation Act, the Congresss debt authority had until March 15th. He notified them of that. We continue to work with Congress. As you know, well be releasing a budget later this week. That's part and parcel of our approach to fiscal responsibility, to making sure that we talk about the path forward, how we address both the ending of fiscal year 17 -- it goes until September 30th this year -- and then the budget, which would be fiscal year 18. But how we address our budget deficits, our debt, and our spending going forward is something that is a holistic conversation that the Secretary and Director Mulvaney and others, and the President and the Vice President are engaging with Congress on. So this isnt -- our job under the law was to notify them of the authority that they passed when it expired, and I think the Secretary will work with Congress on a path forward as far as our debt situation.Q  Secondly, let me get your reaction to Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of Obamacare. He called essentially the plan that you've put forward, if its implemented, a scam. Your reaction to that would be what?MR. SPICER: I think that the plan that he helped create hasnt done so well for Americans seeking health insurance. Again, I have to go to the numbers. But just think about what he sought out to do. There was a pool of people that needed healthcare; they got about 9 million of them. You got 14.4-plus-or-minus million of people who claimed a hardship exemption -- so they have no insurance; that are not receiving Medicaid; that don't qualify for any other assistance, who can't afford Obamacare. And then you've got another 6 million-plus that have chosen to pay the penalty. So I would argue that just on what he sought to achieve in the plan that he helped craft didn't achieve too many great results. Of the people that did get it, their premiums have gone sky high, their choices have gone down, and singlehandedly had a tremendous effect through the rest of the healthcare system. So people who werent even affected by Obamacare initially have now paid higher premiums and get less choices. So even for 175 million people who get employer-based healthcare, they felt the impact of what he sought out to do through higher prices, few choices. So, respectfully, I think that he should just hang out more time at MIT and focus -- and allow good ideas to continue to come forward so that we can focus on achieving the President's goal of doing what he sought out in the first place.Zeke.Q  Thanks, Sean. The President several times recently has said that he would like his healthcare plan to have healthcare for everybody.MR. SPICER: Right.Q  The CBO score yesterday seems to indicate that that's not the case. Will the White House commit that after these phases two and three, if they are implemented, if they're ever offered publicly, that there will be healthcare for everybody? And if you can define that phrase, please.MR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, I think everybody who wants -- look at what Obamacare did. Again, I just ran through the numbers. You've got 30-plus million people of an Obamacare-mandated -- under penalty of law that you had to have health insurance, 9 million of the 30-plus million -- 30 plus-or-minus people got it; 4 million -- 4.5 [million] said, no, we'll pay the penalty; and then another 14 or so million said that we'll claim a hardship. So that was a government-mandated system, and they chose not to do it.I think that in many of these cases, that if people were given the choice and the option to get a plan that sought their needs, was tailored to what they wanted, it wasnt forced down their throat, that didnt give them services they didnt want, and brought down costs -- I read you some of the stories of the individuals -- and we've seen tremendous growth from people who got a reasonably priced plan on the individual market -- $119, $150 bucks a month, which I think for people who arent getting their services through Medicaid because of their financial situation, for many middle-class families, while that's still a struggle, it's an attainable goal in many cases. When you're talking about $350, $500 on the individual market, that's a huge chunk of someone's individual take-home pay. And I think that getting a process that we have down that levels the playing field, allows people who arent getting it through an employer-based system to get a tax credit, that at the same time lowers cost and creates more competition and choices, is actually going to give more people the option to have healthcare and to give more Americans that ability. I mean, right now, they're choosing not to do it.  Q  (Inaudible) you more people. That's still not everybody. MR. SPICER: No, no, no, but everybody has a choice to get it. And that's what I think we want to do, is give everyone who wants to get healthcare the financial ability to get it is what the President is trying to achieve through this. And I think this is the system that will get them there. Right now, they're being forced to get it by a government-run system and in huge margins choosing not to. I think that's the system. And, by the way, they're getting a system that's failing and that is collapsing on its own and is only going in the wrong direction with higher prices, higher premiums, higher deductibles, and lower choice.I mean, that's what you've got now: If you're American citizen on the Obamacare exchange, you're paying more, you have a higher deductible, and your choice is going down. And so that is an unsustainable, unacceptable outcome for Americans who need care.Dave.Q  Thanks, Sean. On immigration, a group that tracks the number of sanctuary cities in the U.S. came out with a report today saying there's now nearly 500 sanctuary cities across the country, and that number has grown by about three dozen just this year. Does that concern the White House? And does it suggest that your warnings about withholding federal funds is not getting through to people?MR. SPICER: I think the last poll I saw on this issue, on sanctuary cities, was somewhere in the 80 percent that American people dont support sanctuary cities, they dont want their tax dollars used to finance people who are in this country illegally. I think if you're a mayor or a councilman or a state representative or a governor in a state, you need to answer to the people that elected you, whether or not you're going to support this. From a federal perspective, I think the President has been very clear that we're not going to use federal taxpayer dollars to support cities that support services to people who are here in this country illegally. But I think at the end of the day, this is a question for mayors and councilmembers at the local level who have to answer to the people that elected them with clearly a position that is not in keeping with what most Americans believe.Eamon.Q  Thanks, Sean. You mentioned the call with the CEO of Anthem Health. Can you tell me what this proposal of the President means for health insurance companies? Will their profits go up or down under the President's proposal?MR. SPICER: Well, I dont think that's been the focus of the President's proposal. It's not about them, it's about patients. But I think what it means for them is that they finally get to create more choice and more plans and allow people to choose a plan that fits them. Right now, they dont have that choice. And, frankly, in more and more markets, companies like Anthem, UnitedHealth, Signa are pulling out -- Aetna -- because they dont have the choice and because of the government mandate. I think what we want to do is allow competition and choice to exist so that they can offer more options for the American people.Q  But will those companies make more money under the President's plan or less?MR. SPICER: I dont know the answer to that. That's not been the focus of what we're doing now. And at the end of the day, right now they're pulling out of market after market, leaving the American people with fewer and fewer choices. So right now it's not a question of -- from the last I checked, I think many of them were doing pretty well, but it's the American people and its patients that are losing under the current system. So I think that there's a way you can do a little of both.Hunter.Q  Yes. We've seen the White House and Secretary Price push back on calling this healthcare bill ""Trumpcare."" Does anything need to change for the President to be comfortable putting his name on the bill?MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I dont think -- the Obama administration didnt label it Obamacare, they called it the ACA. I mean, this is the American Health Care Act. The President is proud of it. The President is proud of the fact that we're working with Congress. But this is a bill that is not his, it's a joint effort that we've worked with the House and the Senate on. He's proud of it. He's proud of the impact that it's going to have on American patients. So I dont think this is about labels and names, this is about getting a job done.John.Q  You keep pointing out that the CBO did not take into consideration phases two or three. Some people might say that the White House has been criticizing the CBO for not taking into account phases two and three in their scoring of the first phase of this. How are they supposed to take into account something that doesnt yet exist?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that that's a question for the House offer. There are constraints that are put on the CBO in terms of what they can't consider. But I think that the point that we want to make is that -- and it came up yesterday at the briefing -- if members are going to base their vote off a score, they need to understand the totality and comprehensive nature of the entire program. And so to base your score off of one piece of information is literally looking --Q  But --MR. SPICER: Hold on, let me answer the question.Q  That's all they had.MR. SPICER: I understand that. But what Im saying is, is that the question that keeps being asked is to see all the reports on this about how its going to impact and not note -- I mean, I don't recall too many packages that read on the evening news last night, or too many of the stories noting that it was one piece of a comprehensive package, noting that it was prong one of three prongs.So, respectfully, I think that when we've gone out here and tried to make sure that people understand the comprehensive nature of whats happening and why it has to happen -- it wasnt by choice that we had to do this. There are certain ways that it had to be conducted because of how it was constructed in the first place in terms of how it gets repealed and replaced. The reconciliation piece of this, which is inside-baseball Senate talk may not make sense to a lot of people, but its the way that we have to go -- the process by which we have to achieve this because of the Senate rules, which is how it was constructed in the first place when Democrats enacted it in 2009.That being said, when we talk about this -- again, you guys, when theres a report that comes out on the evening news, or on cable news, or in the paper, and it doesn't explain the comprehensive nature of this, and it just said, ""the CBO says this is the impact, full stop,"" it is incumbent upon to make sure that people who are trying to understand what we're doing understand that there are two more pieces to come of this.And like anything else, its like building a puzzle. If you only put a third of it on the table and said, hey, look, this puzzle is incomplete, we hid the other two-thirds pieces, is not explaining to people how the whole thing comes together.I think that is a very, very important piece of explaining how this whole thing is going to matter and impact the American people. Q  The other thing Im curious about, too, is can this thing -- the President called it a big, beautiful negotiation. People like Jim Jordan say its a big, beautiful dud. Is there a way to hammer this thing into shape where you can satisfy conservatives?MR. SPICER: I hope so.Q  Or do you have to -- as has been suggested by a number of people -- rip it up and start all over again? Because Jim Jordan just this morning was saying that the fundamental aspects of what was promised the American people by House members when they ran for election back in the fall, and by the President when he ran for election, is not in this bill.MR. SPICER: Well, respectfully, I would suggest that its gone through two House committees that consisted of over 50 Republican members -- when you look at both committees -- with unanimous support. So I get that we can't --Q  (Inaudible) not a Freedom Caucus member on either one of those?MR. SPICER: Okay. I don't know that that's actually true.Q  Well, that's what they said. MR. SPICER: I understand that, but -- Im going to use Major Garrett to fact-check you. (Laughter.) Q  Well, that's just what they're saying. They're saying they didnt get a chance --MR. SPICER: Four Pinocchios -- John Roberts.Q  I did not say that. (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: But my point is, I think that we've got tremendous support. The President, as Ive stated, wants to work with them. There will be a manager's amendment. And I hope that ultimately -- yeah, Id love to have every member support this on both sides of the aisle. I think the Presidents principles and goals are going to benefit every American. And obviously, the more support we get, the better.And as we continue to meet with members and talk to them and get their ideas, I think we're going to have a phenomenal outcome of this bill. Theres a lot of ways we continue to gather input and ideas. And the more that we can get that will achieve that goal, great. And so I hope that he continues to provide us with constructive ideas, and we look forward to getting as many as possible. Major.Q  Sure, lets continue that conversation, because the managers amendment --MR. SPICER: Now its Johns chance to fact check. (Laughter.)Q  The managers amendment is a tacit admission that the bill, as written, can't pass. You wouldnt --MR. SPICER: No, that's not entirely true --Q  You wouldnt put together a managers amendment if you had the votes, correct?MR. SPICER: Well, no, I think its an admission of what we stated at the beginning of this entire process, which is the President was going to engage with members to hear their ideas. He welcomed them. Director Mulvaney stated it multiple times, and Secretary Price, the Vice President. We're not -- this has never been a take it or leave it. And Ive said it from this podium; the President has talked about it, as you mentioned just a second ago. This is an opportunity to hear from individuals and groups and insurance -- and victims of Obamacare, doctors --Q  So is the goal of the manager's amendment to win more Freedom Caucus support --MR. SPICER: Hold on. Its not a question of just -- its not about --Q  -- by dealing with Medicaid or the tax credits or some other alterations? MR. SPICER: Its not about one caucus or one member. Q  Its not?MR. SPICER: No. I think this is about bringing people together. And if we have great ideas that will achieve a better outcome for the American people, then we're going to listen to them and we're going to incorporate them. I don't think that this is -- we have been very clear from the get-go: If you can come with a good idea that will strengthen this bill, that will benefit American patients, well do it.And so the managers amendment is --Q  Passing a bill is about getting votes, right? You can't have a strong bill that can't pass, right?MR. SPICER: No, no, you can -- absolutely. But you can jam through a bill and get it out, and get 218 and send it over to the Senate. But I think that we want to get the strongest bill through the House with as many ideas and opinions and facts that will help strengthen this as possible.So Id rather -- instead of getting a bill through with 218, 219 -- work on a process as the Speaker and the Majority Leader have done that brings in additional ideas. And if we can get the bill higher and higher, we will. Q  To Tom Cottons point -- because you talked about it just a second ago, prongs two and three -- he went out of his way to describe that process, process two and three -- because at least the third part of that is going to require 60 votes because its outside of reconciliation -- by definition as mythical, imaginary, and just spin. And hes telling House Republicans, don't buy into this third- or second-prong argument because a practical, legislative matter don't exist. Because you need 60 votes to get them. And so if you walk the plank -- his words, not mine -- on this first initiative, you're not going to get second and third phase of this process because it can't get through the Senate.MR. SPICER: So theres a couple things. First, this is the only vehicle that seeks to achieve what people on our side of the aisle have been talking about since 2010. This is it. If we don't get this through, the goal of repealing Obamacare and instituting a system that will be patient-centered is going to be unbelievably difficult. This is the vehicle to do that. And so we welcome Senator Cottons ideas. But the second prong of this is administrative in nature. It is something that was delegated to Kathleen Sebelius, who was then the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to do. So prong two is actually fairly easy to do, because the same authority that was granted to Secretary Sebelius now is in the auspices of Dr. Price. And he has the ability to implement and work on that, and I think he noted it yesterday that his office has already been going through and doing that. So that phase is easy to do.The third prong, which is all of these things that conservatives have been championing for a long time, and, frankly, many Democrats agree with us on, is this ability to bring down costs through selling over state lines and allowing small businesses to group together is something that we've been talking about for over a decade.Q  And you can get 60 votes?MR. SPICER: And I think that we can not just get 60 -- I think this is something that should bring people together. I think there is bipartisan, bicameral support for almost every one of these things because they benefit -- there is no one that doesn't benefit. Who could be against allowing insurance to be sold over state lines? Its something that you can do your car insurance -- so many -- there is no other product that I can think of -- Im sure someone will fact-check me on this -- but for the most part, the American consumer, when you want a product, you can go online, you can go to a store. You have choice. You could go to a store across state lines. If you live in Virginia, you can drive to Maryland or the District and shop around. With our insurance, we don't have that ability. Theres no question that increased competition drives down cost. It is just an economic certainty. And allowing greater choice will do the same. And so I think, respectfully, I would say to any senator that has that concern, there is no other entity that I can think of that greater choice and greater competition doesnt drive down cost significantly.And all we have to do is look no farther than Obamacare. I read off three of the individuals the President met with yesterday who were victims of Obamacare. In every one of those cases, the insurance premium went skyrocketing when what? When choice and competition went away. Most any person that was in the individual market eight or nine years ago will tell you that depending on the plan, you could get a plan for as low as 100 bucks and change. Now the cheapest plan you can get is easily in the $300 range. And so the question that you have to ask yourself is, what changed? Competition went down and choice went down. And I think allowing both of those to reenter the marketplace will achieve in itself that goal. And going through the additional pieces of the reform will also do the same thing. Theres so many ways that we can achieve greater choice and competition that unquestionably bring down the cost of health care that benefits every American, whether or not you're in the exchanges or you're on an employer-based plan.And again, we have to have this conversation in the context of whats going on now. Talk to somebody that's on Medicare or Medicaid. Ask them if the doctor and services that they used to be getting are available to them. I know so many times now when you walk into the doctor they have a sign that says, We no longer accept Medicaid. That used to be a given almost. And now, for older Americans, for Americans at the lower end of the income scale, it's becoming harder and harder to find a place that even takes your insurance. And I think that to find that an acceptable income -- the question has to be asked of people who oppose this, no matter what side of the aisle theyre on, is, what is your alternative? Because the ideas that they propose we can incorporate, we can make this better and better. But to sit back and act as though theres a choice. Doing nothing is not a choice. And that's something the President had done.Trey.Q  Thanks, Sean. As you know, the DOJ now has an additional week to produce evidence that President Trump was wiretapped by the Obama administration. How confident is President Trump that any evidence will arise to support his claim?MR. SPICER: I think hes extremely confident. Theres been -- I mean, I mentioned this before -- I'll let them do their job. I'll let the House and Senate and I'll let the DOJ report this. But as I commented in the past, I think theres significant reporting about surveillance techniques that have existed throughout the 2016 election. I'll leave it to them to issue their report. But I think he feels very confident it that will ultimately come to this -- will vindicate him.Q  And a quick follow-up. When a decision is announced, whatever evidence or potentially no evidence is released, will he make a statement about the evidence or lack of evidence?MR. SPICER: I've been asked this I think at least three times, and I don't want to prejudge whats going to come. I'm sure you will do a fine job of asking me the question when theres a report to be asked and I will not be able to escape it. But I don't want to get ahead of what the President may or may not do.Jim.Q  Evidence will be presented?MR. SPICER: I don't want to get ahead of -- as I mentioned, I'm not going to --Q  Because the House Intelligence Committee has given the administration until Monday --MR. SPICER: I understand -- no, it's given the DOJ, and the Department of Justice. Again, we covered this yesterday. But I'm not going to get ahead of what they may or may not submit.Q  It's possible there may be nothing.MR. SPICER: No, that's not -- I think there is -- at least from where we stand, we know that theres significant reporting on the subject that --Q  Something will be presented.MR. SPICER: Yeah, I feel very confident of that.Q  Okay. And a follow-up on coverage. You were saying that people -- if they can't get access to insurance, they don't have coverage. But if you remove the individual mandate, you are going to have people who are not going to buy coverage, theyre not going to buy insurance. And so getting back to the Congressional Budget Office score, would you concede that there will be some coverage losses, perhaps in the millions? That there will be millions of people who will not have health insurance as a result of what you're doing?MR. SPICER: Well, again -- sure, except you have to look at the current situation. You are mandated by law to buy insurance right now under Obamacare; 13-plus million people have asked for a hardship exemption, and 6.5-plus million people have determined to pay the penalty. So, currently, if we look at the universe and say it's roughly 30 million people, only 9 million people engaged in the exchanges when required by law. The majority, almost two-thirds, if my back-of-the-envelope math is right -- about two-thirds have chosen to either apply for a hardship exemption or pay a penalty.Q  The mandate forces people to buy insurance, and if they don't have insurance then you have the free rider problem in the system --MR. SPICER: Right. But look at whats happening now --Q  -- which was a problem in the Obama administration. You have free riders and those folks --MR. SPICER: No, no, no, because the current --Q  -- in a car accident, they show up at the emergency room, and then the health care is much more expensive.MR. SPICER: But my point, Jim, is that the way the system was constructed under Obamacare, they created a system to force people to buy plans that they did not like. They were mandated by the government in terms of what was part of the plan, what it had to cover, the deductible, et cetera, et cetera, and yet, roughly two-thirds of the people either paid a penalty or asked for a hardship exemption. They didnt do it.And so the idea is, actually, if you could bring down cost and choices and allow people to find a plan that fit their budget, that was tailored to their needs, there is actually a higher likelihood that they will find something that they want at a price that they can afford -- as to right now, which is I get a plan that I'm forced to buy that has a deductible that I can't afford, but I've got a cute little plastic card that I can wave around.Q  But it will get you coverage.MR. SPICER: No, no, that's not true.Q  If you show up at the emergency room, if youve been hit by a bus, you're not going to need to pay out of pocket to the hospital until you die. You're going to have some sort of catastrophic coverage that will make sure you have insurance. That is the point.MR. SPICER: Thank you, that's a great advertisement for --Q  You're welcome.MR. SPICER: Thank you. That's exactly what the President is trying to do. Because right now youve got -- of the attempt to get 30 million people covered, 14.4 or 14.5 million people applied for a hardship exemption. Theyre exactly the people that you're talking about. Another 6.5 million people have paid the penalty and don't have it. So we have roughly 20 million people in this country who were supposed to be paying -- required to buy health care that have chosen not to do it who fall in exactly the category that you're talking about. The question --Q  But that number is massive by the year 2026 -- more than 20 million Americans --MR. SPICER: But if they actually had choices and had a plan option that was down near a budget that they could afford, there is a higher likelihood that they would buy a plan that was, A, tailored to them, and B, actually that they could afford.So to your question about catastrophic, right now that's in most cases not even an option. In a third of all the counties in the United States, they only have one choice. In five states, they have one choice. Can you imagine if they could actually buy a plan --Q  You're saying a talking point, but at least --MR. SPICER: It's not a talking point.Q  -- theres coverage in those states. There's an option of coverage.MR. SPICER: No, no, it means -- right, and in a lot of --Q  If you pull this away then you're going to have people in a lot of states who aren't going to have access to any coverage --MR. SPICER: No, no, totally false.Q  -- because they can't afford it with these tax credits that you're providing. MR. SPICER: No, no --Q  Theres an argument to the other side --MR. SPICER: No, theres not. No, actually --Q  The subsidies are more generous --MR. SPICER: Youve got 175 million Americans that get their insurance through their employer. And frankly, right now theyre the ones who keep paying higher and higher premiums because a system that was only supposed to help people get access and require them -- get a government-mandated, government-run healthcare has actually gone amuck. And so right now --Q  You say government-run health care. Medicare is government run.MR. SPICER: Right, and whats happening --Q  You don't have senior citizens screaming that they want you to get rid of their Medicare.MR. SPICER: Yes, they are. I think you need to maybe get outside and talk to some of them, because more and more Medicaid recipients -- in fact, more and more Medicare recipients -- aren't actually able to get coverage. Again, it's one thing to have a card. It's another thing to walk into a doctors office and them to tell you, we no longer accept Medicaid anymore. That's not care.Q  But the President is okay with there are going to be millions of people who aren't going to have coverage?MR. SPICER: No, no, the Presidents goal is to provide healthcare coverage to every American. And right now theyre not getting that. And by giving them more choices at a lower cost, more Americans can either buy healthcare for their family or themselves, or, in a lot of cases, for their business, without paying the penalty, which is what a lot of them are doing, or forcing people into exchanges that have fewer and fewer choices.The system now is not working. The costs are going up, the choices are going down, and deductibles are going up. That is not an option. And for every American -- and I mentioned this earlier -- to make this look like a choice, there isnt really a choice. The system that we have now is failing. The choice is whether we give them an opportunity to have real care and in a way that is tailored to them in their budget.Jeff.Q  Sean, on a different subject. The Intelligence Committee yesterday, when responding to the Department of Justice's request for more time, basically issued a subpoena threat. Does the White House have a reaction to that? Do you think it will come that far?MR. SPICER: I hope not. And as I said, as has been noted, the Department asked for additional time, and that will be up to the Intelligence Committee to grant that time. But they're working on that. Q  And on a separate note, you mentioned the President's call with the CEO of Anthem today. Does he have a position on Anthem's effort to merge with Signa, which was challenged by the Justice Department under President Obama?MR. SPICER: I dont -- I'm not aware of that. I dont know that that would -- that the President has ever expressed any personal view. I think that would come under the FTC, if I'm correct, and so I'd refer you to them.John.Q  Just one last follow-up on Margaret's question about Saudi. I know that that meeting was just finishing up when you came out here, but can you give us a sense of what was on the agenda before they sat down?MR. SPICER: I think the President had a call earlier with the King, a couple weeks back. I think they talked about safe havens in Syria, they talked about the threat of ISIS. I would expect all of those came up. But again, I think -- I will provide a readout to you all, to everyone in the pool, about what happened that will more clearly define that.John Gizzi.Q  Thank you, Sean. Coming up in the rest of the year are four special elections for the U.S. House of Representatives, all of which are sure to draw national attention as venues for debate on the American Health Care Act. Does the President plan to be involved on behalf of the Republican candidates and perhaps appear on their behalf of the districts as this may well be a barometer of where people feel about the American Health Care Act?MR. SPICER: You're also going to have elections in Virginia and New Jersey, as far as I'm aware. And I think that as we get further into the schedule and get closer to elections, we'll obviously entertain requests from candidates at a variety of -- level to gauge the President's support. So he's been very supportive of candidates in the last cycle. I dont see him not being -- continued support of people that want to fight hard for the agenda. We're not at that point yet, so I can probably give you more at some point as we move closer to the elections. But in a lot of those cases it's going to be dependent on whether or not there's a request from the candidate or not.Julie.Q  Thanks, Sean. You said earlier that the White House doesnt have projections on how many people will lose coverage. Is that a projection that hasnt been made yet? Are you saying that the White House is not going to come out with those numbers?MR. SPICER: That's not something that OMB does.Q  But if you're advocating for a plan that you say the President wants to cover everyone, how are you going to be able to assess whether you've been successful if you're not going to project that yourself and CBO's projections, you're saying, are invalid?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that if you look at what the goal is, which is to make healthcare available to every American -- as I said, I mean, you have a choice right now that's either we support a failing system that there is no choice and that the premiums are going up, or you provide them with a system that we're looking at, which does address the 30 million people -- it gives them a tax credit, it gives them great choice. And one of the issues that I have with a lot of the models that I see around is they're very static; they talk about this prong only. I think when you look at the subsidy and the cost of a current plan right now, without looking at prong two and three and how those will additionally drive down cost, that it's not a fair analysis of where the plan is going. But there's no question that right now there is -- I detailed it to Jim -- I mean, we have a system that mandates that people buy health insurance under penalty of law, and it's not working. And so the question is, what can we do instead and what can we replace that with that gives people greater choice and lowers cost. I think in most cases, of course some people are always going to choose in a free society to not purchase something -- I mean, we live in a country of 320 million people -- at some point, you can't force a product or a good down people in a free society. But I think if you can give them a quality product that serves their needs, that they have the time, at a price that they can afford, there's a greater likelihood under every economic model that that suggests that that will work.So I think it's, frankly, economics 101 and basic common sense that dictate that the more competition and the more choice that we institute in the system, the greater likelihood of more and more Americans getting healthcare is something that is easy.John.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. I want to ask you about the American Health Care Act, but I want to first see if you have an answer to a question that I asked you yesterday, and that was one that you did not know the full answer to, about whether there are repercussions for violations of that five-year lobbying ban.MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, I do owe you an explanation on that. I will check with Counsel and get back to you.Q  Okay. And then on the American Health Care Act, you use language very similar to language that House Speaker Paul Ryan used about why Republicans should support this legislation. You talked about this binary choice -- it's either this particular legislation or it's Obamacare. You have Republicans in control of the House and the Senate, you have President Trump in the White House. Why do they have to vote on this particular bill? Why can't they negotiate for something that, for instance, the Freedom Caucus thinks may be a better piece of legislation?MR. SPICER: Well, to get back to a question that Major asked -- I mean, at the end of the day, whatever it is has to at least get 218 votes. You obviously want the greatest number of votes as possible, but you need to get 218, and in the case of the Senate under reconciliation, only 50 votes. But that's your floor. And I think that what you need to do is to get enough members coalescing around key principles to get you to that floor. Now, you can obviously go as high as 435 in terms of the ceiling. I'm not sure we'll hit that. But the floor is what's going to coalesce the greatest number of members around a bill that gets you at 218. So we will continue to work with them, provide ideas and input. And regardless of what caucus or faction you're a part of, if you have an idea that can enhance this bill and make it more patient-centric and achieve the goals, then we're all for it. So that's a process. And I think Speaker Ryan has been talking about this since 2010. There have been a lot of ideas, a lot of debate, and a lot of issues put forward into how to craft this.So this has been something that's been in the works for seven-plus years in terms of getting members, at least in the Republican conference, to coalesce around principles and ideas and solutions to make this a more patient-centric thing.Francesca.Q  Two quick clarifications and then one other thing. It sounded like you were telling Mike to ask Paul Ryan about phases two and three. Phase two would be regulatory measures that the President and Secretary Price would be in charge of. When can we expect to see a list of those from the White House?MR. SPICER: I will ask Secretary Price. I know that he mentioned yesterday when he came out to talk to folks after the score, that his office was working on that. I'll be glad to see if we have a timeline on that, and then follow up with you on that.Q  And also, it sounded like you were saying that the White House is confident that you'll get to 60 votes on those things in phase three, those measures that conservatives have been asking for. Is the White House confident about the 60 votes?MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Okay. And then the final thing is, it's also on healthcare as well. Yesterday, Secretary Price said that he wasnt saying to disregard the CBO report completely. But that sounds like what the administration is arguing and what you're arguing as well from the podium. You said that the CBO coverage estimates are consistently wrong --MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q  -- and you've questioned their credibility from here.MR. SPICER: No, no, no, just to be clear, CBO is a budget office. They look at impacts on the federal budget. That is why they were created, and that's what they do. And I think to look at them in terms of their budget numbers is one thing; that's their job. And I think on the aspect of budget impact, it talked about how while we currently see a 25 percent increase in premiums this year under Obamacare and the individual market, it markedly shows that under the current American Health Care Act, there will be a 10 percent decline in premium.Where I think the CBO has gotten it wrong -- and it's not a question of what we characterize it as; it's a fact -- the CBO, when it tried to project people and coverage, was over 50 percent wrong the last time. And the point that I think we're trying to make is that when you look at their record and you say the last time they did this they were off by more than 50 percent -- they projected 24 million who would be covered by Obamacare in the exchanges in 2016; in fact, that number was initially 10.4 and it's dropping. And so the question that you have to ask yourself is, if you're using that as a gauge to determine our vote, you need to question whether or not they do counting people like they do counting numbers. I think on the budget thing, that's what their wheelhouse is for, that's what they do -- they count budget -- they look at budgetary impact on things. When they have come to counting people, they've been wrong and vastly so. And I think it's important for people to understand that context in which those numbers are given to you. And I think that's something that I just want to make sure of.Jordan.Q  Thanks, Sean. I asked you yesterday about the President's response to Steve King. Do you have anything on that?MR. SPICER: I think the President believes that this is not a point of view that he shares. He believes he's the President for all Americans, and so I'll leave it at that.Jim.Q  Reports surfaced Friday that the President will support primary challengers to conservative lawmakers who dont support the final version of the American Health Care Act. Can you confirm that report? And if it's true, can you offer us insight into what the President is looking for in congressional candidates in 2018?MR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- I dont have anything for you on that.Veronica.Q  Sean, it's Ronica.MR. SPICER: Ronica.Q  I'm sorry.MR. SPICER: No, I'm sorry.Q  If we fix it now, we get it done. Okay, two questions. The first one: Does the President believe that he was surveilled through microwaves and televisions?MR. SPICER: I'm not going to -- I will just say the President has tweeted about this. He's pretty clear that he believes that there was surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election, and we're going to wait for the conclusion of that. I think there's pretty sound evidence that has been -- that the microwave is not a sound way of surveilling someone. And I think that has been cleaned up. It was made in jest. So I think we can put that to rest.Q  Okay. Second question. Newt Gingrich said that the COB [sic] should be abolished. You're saying some pretty harsh words against parts, aspects of the COB. Would the President agree with that?MR. SPICER: CBO.Q  Oh, excuse me.MR. SPICER: No, I got it wrong with you. So now we're even. (Laughter.) But look, that's -- Speaker Gingrich obviously -- I'll let him comment on the House. CBO was established I think in the Budget Act from 1974. It's up to members to decide on the House and Senate whether or not they want to go through this. We've got OMB, they've got CBO. I'm not going to get in the business of telling the House who their scorekeeper should be in the House. Cecilia.Q  Sean, just quickly, I wanted to circle back on something. You started to answer it, but apologies if you did. I want to clarify, though. Can you stand here today and say that the President will keep his promise of insurance for everybody?MR. SPICER: I think the President's goal is to provide insurance -- to make insurance available to everybody, yes. That's what he intends to do. I think that is -- the goal of this is to make sure that every American has the choice and a plan that they can afford and that they have the choice to buy. And that's not what they have now.Q  Sean, thanks very much. I wonder if the White House has a view on reports from Bloomberg that Jared Kushner's family stands to gain around half a billion dollars from a real estate deal with Anbang Corporation, which is linked to the Chinese government, or has been linked to the Chinese government in the past.MR. SPICER: I dont. I mean, I'd leave that -- I'd refer you back to the Kushner companies to talk about their entities. Jared went through extraordinary lengths, as you all know, and we provided a lot of documentation on this, to make sure that he -- although he's not taking a salary here -- that he complied as if he was an employee, and went through extraordinary lengths to make sure that he de-conflicted himself and worked through the Office of Government Ethics.Q  Is Jared currently working on preparations for Xi Jinping's visit to Mar-a-Lago?MR. SPICER: I'm sure he's involved in a lot of stuff. I dont know specifically who's involved in that visit.Q  Sean, you did just say that the President still stands by making sure that insurance can be afforded by everyone. What's your specific response to the CBO's estimate that for someone who's 64 years old, making $26,000, that right now, under current law, they would shell out $1,700 in a premium, but under this change, the premium would go up from $1,700 to $14,600? What's the message to a 54-year-old, who, 10 years from now, faces that?MR. SPICER: I think that, again, I would go back to the fact that I dont think that that analysis takes into consideration the choice that they have. Part of the problem right now, Steve, is a 54-year-old doesnt need certain things. They dont need maternity care, they dont need certain medical services that are being provided to them by this government product that is being forced on them right now. So, number one, you have a product that is being served up to older Americans, middle-aged Americans, or younger Americans that doesnt fit where they are in life and the services that they need. And so, number one, having more choice and the ability to tailor a plan towards the needs that an individual has depending on their stage of life, whether it's an individual or a family, number one. Number two, that they dont have any competition. So when you combine both of those things together, I think that number goes way down. And then the third is that they can have whatever subsidy they want now, but on the exchange, in many cases, again, they're getting a subsidy to a plan that has a very high deductible so that they have a card but not care. And that is, again, not an apples-to-apples way to examine the current plans. And that's what this really all comes down to.Q  So the message then is, wait until phases two and three come in, and then we'll have something better?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, I think -- it's not just wait, it's that you have to look at the totality of what we're doing to understand how this is going to impact the plan. But right now, in the scenario that you're giving, a 54-year-old doesnt have choice, is buying a plan that they dont want or need for the most part, and has a subsidy that's probably not giving them the ability to go see the doctors that they need to because their deductible is off the chart. And that's one thing that's missing in a lot of these discussions, is that you can have a premium for month, but if your deductible is skyrocketing, then, again, you might be able to get an appointment, but you're not getting care.Sharon.Q  Oh, Cheryl. Thanks.MR. SPICER: Cheryl. I'm not good on this side. (Laughter.) Q  The budget is coming out Thursday, and I'm just trying to find out how detailed is that going to be. Are you going to be giving agency levels, program levels? Or are we going to see what programs are going to be eliminated in the budget?MR. SPICER: I'll let Director Mulvaney -- he's going to have an entire presentation. I know they'll start background briefings tomorrow for you all. They'll walk through different aspects of the budget. I dont want to get ahead of him on this. So let's figure out where we go first on this with what he has, and then we'll have a full presentation on Thursday.Q  Can you just say if the infrastructure plan is going to be part of that, or is that going to be later?MR. SPICER: No, that's separate. That is separate. Gabi.Q  Thanks. I have two questions. The first one: The President, one of his signature campaign promises on immigration was to pursue HB-1 visa reform. And on April 1st, the United States will begin accepting new HB-1 visa applications. Can we expect to see any movement on that before then?MR. SPICER: That's a good question. I dont -- I think -- we've talked about immigration in the past. I think there is an entire comprehensive process that's being looked at in terms of how we're preventing illegal immigration and then what we're doing about legal immigration, whether it's H1-Bs or K1 or other visas that exist within the system. There is an entire look that is being taken with respect to the visa program. And we will have more for you as we get through the system.Thank you, guys, very much. We're headed off to Detroit and Nashville tomorrow. If you're not on the trip, we look forward to -- I hope everyone wears their green on Thursday and Friday. You got a double shot at it this year because of the visit. So thank you. Stay safe on the roads.Q  How are you all going to do the background briefings?MR. SPICER: Right here.END3:14 P.M.

335,2017-03-15,Remarks by the Vice President to the American Ireland Fund National Gala,"The National Building MuseumWashington, D.C.8:20 P.M. EDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you so much.Taoiseach, Fionnuola, Ambassador Anne Anderson, John Fitzpatrick, Kieran, Senator Mitchell, members of Congress, and distinguished guests, it is hard to describe what a privilege it is for me and my family to join you here tonight for the American Ireland Funds 25th Silver Anniversary National Gala. Thank you for having us tonight. (Applause.)I bring greetings tonight from my friend, the leader of the free world, the 45th President of the United States, and to the Taoiseach I would say, as hell find out, a guy who likes to play golf in Ireland, President Donald Trump. (Applause.)The President asked me to give everyone his greetings and his best wishes tonight. And also our hope is that my presence here tonight is a visible sign of Americas enduring friendship with Ireland and all her people.You know, I actually received the invitation to be here tonight nearly two months before the President and I were sworn in for these offices of ours. It was one of the very first invitations I received after the election, and Im humbled to say, it was the first one that I accepted. And Im honored and privileged to be here tonight. (Applause.)Tonight is really a family affair. Its been said before from this podium this evening. I can tell you it feels that way to our family, and its a joy for me tonight to be joined by my wife of 31 years and our new Second Lady, Karen Pence. (Applause.)Karen and I are also delighted to be joined tonight by our Irish daughter Charlotte Rose. (Applause.) And my Irish sisters, Annie and Mary, traveled from far across the country to be with us tonight. And if there werent all these inches of snow, Mr. Taoiseach, I can assure my mother, 83 years young, red hair, crystal blue eyes, would still be here. But I know shes smiling. (Applause.)This really does feel more like a homecoming for us, too, to be honest with you. And Ill talk about that on a personal level a little bit later.It is my privilege to be here tonight on behalf of the President of the United States to address the American Ireland Fund. Since its founding in 1976, the fund and its sister organizations have raised a remarkable $550 million dollars to support peace, prosperity, and cultural accomplishment on the Emerald Isle. That's a staggering amount of generosity, as we've already heard before. Ireland, and all who call it home, have benefited tremendously from the generosity of you who are gathered here tonight and all who have gone before.And thats worth dwelling on. Theres a reason why so many in this room -- and in this country -- have been so generous towards Ireland. We may be separated by an ocean, but the American people have always been bound by a kinship to the Irish people, and we always will. (Applause.)The bond between the people of America and the people of Ireland stretches back into the mists of American history. Drawn by the promise of this brave new world, the sons and daughters of Ireland began leaving their land for ours as far back as the 17th century. They came here, one by one, or sometimes in small bands. But what they lacked in numbers, we already heard tonight, they more than made up in courage.Irish immigrants and their descendants became proud patriots in America. Thousands fought for their adopted homeland -- and the timeless ideals we hold dear -- in our Revolutionary War. No fewer than nine, as you've already heard, signers of the Declaration of Independence, no fewer than four of the Founding Fathers at our Constitutional Convention could trace their roots to Ireland. And no less a man than George Washington himself, our first President, referred to Ireland as a friend of my country. And so it will always be. (Applause.)From the Revolutionary War to the Irish Brigades in our Civil War, Irish Americans have fought for freedom in every American conflict. And before I go one step further, would the men and women who are with us here tonight who have worn the uniform of the United States of America, please stand and give us the opportunity to thank you one more time for your service to this country? You make us proud. (Applause.)But Irelands contributions to America didnt end with the establishment of the shining city on a hill. Indeed, none saw that beacon more clearly, or with more excitement, than the Irish across the sea. Whereas once they had come to America slowly, in a trickle, suddenly the children of Ireland came here in a swell as history records.They spread to every corner of this continent, settling in cities and towns, in places where none had settled before. And wherever they went, opportunity and prosperity soon followed. From the vantage point of the present, its clear that the Irish have left an indelible mark on the history of this country for the betterment of the American people and the betterment of the world.Our history books are filled with the names of Irish immigrants and their descendants. More than 32 million Americans can trace their heritage back to Ireland, a reminder that the Irish are one of the strongest and most vibrant threads of our national fabric.And tonight, its an honor to be here on behalf of President Trump to reaffirm the United States enduring commitment to the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, to the peace process, and above all else, to the timeless and enduring friendship between our people and yours. (Applause.)Tonight, Id like to express our friendship by letting you know that Americans of all backgrounds have been heartened to see Irelands extraordinary accomplishments in recent years. The story of the Irish everywhere is one of facing hardship and emerging stronger for it, and theres perhaps no better recent example than Irelands remarkable economic success story over the past decade.Its amazing to think of Irelands recovery after the global financial crisis. It was the first country to exit the IMFs Eurozone economic assistance program. And for the last two years, Ireland has been one of the fastest growing economies in the European Union. (Applause.)I firmly believe one of the key reasons for this is the drive, the determination, the character, and the ingenuity of the Irish people wherever they may live. Taoiseach, Irelands success is testament I can say on behalf of everyone here to your strong leadership these past six years. And many leaders around the world would surely do well to emulate your example in Ireland. (Applause.)Another sign of our friendship with Ireland is Americas robust economic partnership with you. We host many innovative and successful Irish companies here in the United States, and in 2015 Im pleased to see that Irish direct investment in America totaled $13.5 billion, creating many good-paying American jobs.Tonight Im proud to say with great confidence that our bond is strong, and it will grow stronger still. (Applause.)But Im not just here to discuss the Republic of Ireland. On behalf of President Trump, Id also like to congratulate the people of Northern Ireland on their election only two weeks ago, which had one of the highest turnouts in recent memory.The advance of peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland is one of the great success stories of the past 20 years. Many in this room, and the Ireland Funds across the world, have played a leading role in fostering this progress. Senator Mitchell, you have been properly paid tribute tonight. Let me thank you personally. Its an honor to be with you tonight. Im proud to be an American, the nation that you call home. And Im proud of what Senator Mitchell and all of you have done to advance the peace and the prosperity of people all across the island. (Applause.)And we thank those unsung heroes in Ireland and Northern Ireland who day-in and day-out, do the difficult and important work of strengthening communities, educating children, building that brighter future for Emerald Isle and all who call it home. Their heroic actions bring to mind someone else, a proud son of Ireland, a proud servant of America -- Thomas Francis Meagher.On this side of the Atlantic, we remember Meagher for his bravery in our Civil War. He led the Irish Brigade I mentioned just a few moments ago, and he ultimately rose to the rank of brigadier general. He was originally from Ireland. In 1848, he famously designed the Irish tricolor that flies over the republic to this very day.Upon presenting his design, he spoke words that resonate even today, and I quote: The white in the center signifies a lasting truce between the orange and the green -- and I trust that beneath its folds, the hands of the Irish Protestant and the Irish Catholic may be clasped in generous and heroic brotherhood.Tonight, lets all pray that those hands of brotherhood may never separate. (Applause.)Lets also pray to strengthen the hands of friendship that reach across the Atlantic, between the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland and the people of United States.This bond was forged by our forebears, and it endures to this day, and its bequeathed to us to strengthen it.Whether they left their homeland for another, or stayed in the country of their birth, they shared a heritage -- and more than that, they shared hope for a brighter future, and they strived to find it with all their might.So many millions of them found it here on these shores. And we're proud that they call America home. The story of the Irish in America is the story of America itself. And as I close, let me just say its hard for me to express the pride that I feel on night like tonight because my little family is a small part of that story, the story of Ireland and America.Like so many of my fellow countrymen, I literally carry Ireland with me everywhere I go. On one of my first trips to Ireland when I was a young man, I was sitting -- what did you call it? -- in a public house. (Laughter.) Pat Morrisseys Pub -- its still open in Doonbeg to this day. Pat was around back then, and he let me help out behind the bar. Ill never forget the little old lady who spoke to me. And I told her very quickly that I was related to the Morrisseys, distant cousins. And I said, actually Im Irish by heritage. And she looked at me and smile and said, you don't have to tell me, son, youve got a face like the map of Ireland. (Laughter.)It does all go back to that day. It was Inauguration Day just a few short weeks ago. People ask me what I was thinking about surrounded by my wife and my children, our beautiful new daughter-in-law. My mother was just there, a few seats behind the President. I just kept thinking of that day in April in 1923. That was the day when Richard Michael Cawley stepped off the boat on Ellis Island. He was in his early 20s when he steamed into Upper New York Bay aboard the Andania, the ship that carried him here.I can't imagine what the sight of the Statue of Liberty meant to him that day, holding aloft the torch of freedom. My grandfather went home to be with the Lord when it was in about my 26th year. But we were very close. He said I was the only Irishman born among the four boys in our family. (Laughter.) Not sure yet what that meant. But I was flattered by it.My grandpa had grown up in a little town called Tobercurry, in County Sligo. When I was young man I had a chance to visit that house before they tore it down. It was just a two-room house where his eight brothers and sisters grew up. And I literally walked up the hill that -- when Karen and I and the kids visited Ireland just a few years ago, we walked up that hill, as well. The legend in our family was my great grandmother had stood outside that little house and looked over at the Ox Mountains and looked off to the west, and told him that he needed to go because she said, theres a future there for you.He wouldnt speak to his mother for 25 years. And when he said the old country, he said with a reverence that I could never adequately express. He talked about crossing the pond, talked about the heartbreak of that separation.But as I stood on that inaugural stage, I just kept thinking of that Irishman. I kept thinking of what he would be thinking about looking down from glory. And I know two things for sure.Number one, knowing me as well as he did, he would be extremely surprised. (Laughter.) Number two, I have to think he just thought he was right. He was right about America. He was right to summon the courage as generations did before and since to come here and follow their dreams, and make the contributions that they did. He was right to drive that bus for 40 years in Chicago. He was right to raise that irascible redhead that would marry a fast-talking salesman and follow work down to a little, small farm town in southern Indiana and raise six kids with the same heritage and the same values that she had been raised with.The truth is that whatever honors I will receive over the course of my service as Vice President, and to receive an honor in the name of the Irish people and my Irish heritage will count as chief among them. Because all that I am and all that I will ever be and all the service that I will ever render is owing to my Irish heritage. And I will summon what is the best of it as I serve the people of this country with the faith, with the determination, with the cheerfulness, the humility, and the humor that is characteristic of the great people of the Emerald Isle.So heres to Ireland. Heres to the United States of America. Heres to our shared heritage, and heres to the confident, confident hope that the ties between our people and the Irish people will only grow and expand as the years go on to the betterment of our people and the world.Thank you very much for this honor tonight. And God bless you all. (Applause.)END8:36 P.M. EDT",20950.1,112.72999999999956,5900.05,43.23000000000047,2385.26,19.8100000000004
336,2017-03-15,Remarks by the President on 250th Anniversary of the Birth of President Andrew Jackson,"The HermitageNashville, Tennessee4:44 P.M. CDTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. (Applause.) Wow, what a nice visit this was. Inspirational visit, I have to tell you. Im a fan. Im a big fan.I want to thank Howard Kettell, Francis Spradley of the Andrew Jackson Foundation, and all of the foundations incredible employees and supporters for preserving this great landmark, which is what it is -- its a landmark of our national heritage.And a special thank you to Governor Bill Haslam and his incredible wife, who -- we just rode over together -- and Senators Lamar Alexander and Bob Corker, two great friends of mine, been a big, big help. Both incredible guys.In my address to Congress, I looked forward nine years, to the 250th anniversary of American Independence. Today, I call attention to another anniversary: the 250th birthday of the very great Andrew Jackson. (Applause.) And he loved Tennessee, and so do I -- to tell you that. (Applause.)On this day in 1767, Andrew Jackson was born on the backwoods soil of the Carolinas. From poverty and obscurity, Jackson rose to glory and greatness -- first as a military leader, and then as the seventh President of the United States.He did it with courage, with grit, and with patriotic heart. And by the way, he was one of our great Presidents. (Applause.)Jackson was the son of the frontier. His father died before he was born. His brother died fighting the British in the American Revolution. And his mother caught a fatal illness while tending to the wounded troops. At the age of 14, Andrew Jackson was an orphan, and look what he was able to do. Look what he was able to build.It was during the Revolution that Jackson first confronted and defied an arrogant elite. Does that sound familiar to you? (Laughter.) I wonder why they keep talking about Trump and Jackson, Jackson and Trump. Oh, I know the feeling, Andrew. (Laughter.)Captured by the Redcoats and ordered to shine the boots of a British officer, Jackson simply refused. The officer took his saber and slashed at Jackson, leaving gashes in his head and hand that remained permanent scars for the rest of his life. These were the first and far from the last blows that Andrew Jackson took for his country that he loved so much.From that day on, Andrew Jackson rejected authority that looked down on the common people. First as a boy, when he bravely served the Revolutionary cause. Next, as the heroic victor at New Orleans where his ragtag -- and it was ragtag -- militia, but they were tough. And they drove the British imperial forces from America in a triumphant end to the War of 1812. He was a real general, that one.And, finally, as President -- when he reclaimed the peoples government from an emerging aristocracy. Jacksons victory shook the establishment like an earthquake. Henry Clay, Secretary of State for the defeated President John Quincy Adams, called Jacksons victory mortifying and sickening. Oh, boy, does this sound familiar. (Laughter.) Have we heard this? (Laughter.) This is terrible. He said there had been no greater calamity in the nations history.The political class in Washington had good reason to fear Jacksons great triumph. The rich and powerful, Jackson said, too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes. Jackson warned they had turned government into an engine for the support of the few at the expense of the many.Andrew Jackson was the Peoples President, and his election came at a time when the vote was finally being extended to those who did not own property. To clean out the bureaucracy, Jackson removed 10 percent of the federal workforce. He launched a campaign to sweep out government corruption. Totally. He didn't want government corruption. He expanded benefits for veterans. He battled the centralized financial power that brought influence at our citizens expense. He imposed tariffs on foreign countries to protect American workers. That sounds very familiar. Wait till you see whats going to be happening pretty soon, folks. (Laughter.) Its time. Its time. Andrew Jackson was called many names, accused of many things, and by fighting for change, earned many, many enemies. Today the portrait of this orphan son who rose to the presidency hangs proudly in the Oval Office, opposite the portrait of another great American, Thomas Jefferson. I brought the Andrew Jackson portrait there. (Applause.) Right behind me, right -- boom, over my left shoulder. Now Im honored to sit between those two portraits and to use this high office to serve, defend, and protect the citizens of the United States. It is my great honor. I will tell you that.From that desk I can see out the wonderful, beautiful, large great window to an even greater magnolia tree, standing strong and tall across the White House lawn. That tree was planted there many years ago, when it was just a sprout carried from these very grounds. Came right from here. (Applause.) Beautiful tree.That spout was nourished, it took root, and on this, his 250th birthday, Andrew Jacksons magnolia is a sight to behold. I looked at it actually this morning. Really beautiful. (Applause.) But the growth of that beautiful tree is nothing compared to growth of our beautiful nation. That growth has been made possible because more and more of our people have been given their dignity as equals under law and equals in the eyes of God.Andrew Jackson as a military hero and genius and a beloved President. But he was also a flawed and imperfect man, a product of his time. It is the duty of each generation to carry on the fight for justice. My administration will work night and day to ensure that the sacred rights which God has bestowed on His children are protected for each and every one of you, for each and every American. (Applause.)We must all remember Jacksons words: that in the planter, the farmer, the mechanic, and the laborer, we will find muscle and bone of our country. So true. So true. Now, we must work in our time to expand -- and we have to do that because we have no choice. We're going to make America great again, folks. We're going to make America great again -- (applause) -- to expand the blessings of America to every citizen in our land. And when we do, watch us grow. Watch whats happening. You see it happening already. You see it with our great military. You see it with our great markets. You see it with our incredible business people. You see it with the level of enthusiasm that they havent seen in many years. People are proud again of our country. And you're going to get prouder and prouder and prouder, I can promise you that. (Applause.)And watch us grow. We will truly be one nation, with deep roots, a strong core, and a very new springtime of American greatness yet to come.Andrew Jackson, we thank you for your service. We honor you for your memory. We build on your legacy. And we thank God for the United States of America.Thank you very much, everybody. (Applause.) END4:54 P.M. CDT",20950.1,112.72999999999956,5900.05,43.23000000000047,2385.26,19.8100000000004
337,2017-03-15,"Press Gaggle en route to Nashville, TN","Aboard Air Force OneEn Route Nashville, Tennessee4:27 P.M. EDTMR. SPICER: All right, good afternoon. I wanted to mention here at the top that yesterday after the briefing, moments after she was sworn in -- Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price and Seema Verda, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in their first joint action, co-signed a letter to the nations governors reaffirming the departments intent to work directly with the states to improve the Medicaid program and enhance the lives of the people it serves.The Secretary and the Administrator echoed their strong belief -- of this entire administration -- that when states have more freedom to design programs that meet the diverse needs of the unique Medicaid population theyll produce reforms that result in better healthcare outcomes.Tonight, White House officials will be flooding the zone on the repeal and replace option that we've talked about on healthcare. Dr. Price will be on CNN for a live town hall at 9:00 p.m., and the President will be appearing on Tucker Carlson on Fox, as well, describing his actions to repeal and replace Obamacare and replace it with a more patient-centric healthcare option.Also last night, the President announced his intent to nominate several individuals to key administration posts -- James Donovan as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury; J. Christopher Giancarlo as Chairman of the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission; Eric Hargan as the Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services; Adam Lerrick as Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Finance; Andrew K. Maloney as Deputy Under Secretary of the Treasury for Legislative Affairs; David Malpass, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs; Sigal Mandelker as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence; and Brent James McIntosh as General Counsel of the Department of Treasury.Moving on to today, this morning a broad coalition of leading conservative organizations sent an open letter to Congress endorsing the American Health Care Act. Some of the groups who signed the letter include the Americans for Tax Reform, the Association of Mature American Citizens, Log Cabin Republicans, and the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. These groups announced their support for the AHCA because they know its a conservative and sensible step towards reforming our healthcare system. The AHCA repeals nearly all of Obamacares tax increases, implements the most significant entitle reform in over 20 years, and provides mean-tested tax credits for those who don't have access to employer-sponsored insurance or government programs.This announcement comes on the same morning that the Department of Health and Human Services released enrollment numbers showing that almost half a million fewer Americans signed up for Obamacare this year than last. The bottom line is Obamacare is on the brink of failure, and together with Congress, the President is working to deliver positive change to our broken healthcare system through both the AHCA and through additional policy changes that will increase competition and decrease costs.Also today in Detroit the President made major announcements on CAFE greenhouse gas emissions standards for the auto sector. When leaders from around the U.S. auto industry met with the President during one of his first days in office, they discussed specific actions that he could take to eliminate government barriers to job creation and their industry. Specifically, they sent him a letter unanimously requesting the President reinstate the data-driven midterm review of fuel economy GHG rules through model year 2025 without prejudging the outcome and to harmonize federal requirements.The President listened and researched the request. He concluded that this was the right thing today, and he quickly took action. Today in Michigan, the President celebrated the American manufacturing and ingenuity that this administration will continue to set free from unnecessary, overcomplicated, and unproductive regulation. Our nations great auto manufacturers no longer have to wonder if they have an ally or an adversary in the White House. The President clearly showed once again today that hes committed to working together with businesses and unions to rethink our regulatory system to grow our economy.The Presidents regulatory reform is being applauded across many industries, not just the auto industry that we saw here in Detroit. This morning the National Association of Home Builders released its monthly index for March, which is set at its all-time level in 12 years. The NAHB directly cited President Trumps actions on regulatory reform, specifically mentioning his recent executive orders on the Waters of the United States rule as a cause of the surge.Under the Presidents leadership, the United States will once again be the worlds greatest magnet for innovation and job creation.Once we get to Nashville, the President will head to Andrew Jacksons Hermitage where he will take a tour and lay a wreath on the Presidents tomb in commemoration of his 250th birthday, which we celebrate today.Of course, tomorrow is budget day. OMB Director Mulvaney did a background briefing earlier this morning. Theres a transcript available by the pool for those who werent able to listen in. Tomorrow, the Presidents budget blueprint will be delivered to the Hill and posted online, and tomorrow afternoon, Director Mulvaney will join us at the daily press briefing for all of your budget-related questions. Finally, I want to make sure that all of you remember to get your requests in for the Easter Egg Roll. The lottery went live today on Recreation.gov. Its available through Saturday of this week.And with that, Ill take your questions.Q  Scott, on the Yahoo-Russia -- oh, Sean. Who is Scott? I don't even --MR. SPICER: No, that's okay. (Laughter.) Q  On the Yahoo Russia hacking, was anyone from the administration read in before those indictments? And is the President planning any other actions against Russia after those indictments around this Yahoo hack?MR. SPICER: Im not sure if anyone from the Department of Justice read anyone in, but Im not aware of that. I would refer you to the Department of Justice on that.Q  Are there any other actions on Russia?MR. SPICER: I cant -- thats a Department of Justice issue.Q  On the tax returns that were published last night, a couple questions on that. Firstly, the statement last night said that the White House believes that MSNBC, I presume, is breaking the law. Are there intentions there -- I dont know if it would come from the Presidents personal lawyer or from the White House -- to pursue legal actions against MSNBC?MR. SPICER: Id have to follow up with the Presidents personal lawyer. But, I mean, theres several issues there that are concerning with how they did it.Number one, it is illegal to publish somebodys individual tax returns. Thats against the law. And its ironic, of all institutions, to have NBC News, in so many ways, brag about something like that. They are an institution -- and then not only did they violate it, but then they went on last night and through today, and questioned the Presidents integrity by whether or not he put them out. Its ironic that a news institution like NBC News, that has sat in the briefing room day after day and questioned our integrity, and questioned whether or not we had the proof for certain issues and allegations and policies, and then sat there and speculated openly, and pushed a narrative about whether the President was behind this. Its despicable and reprehensible, and they should be ashamed of themselves as how they conducted themselves regarding this entire episode.Q  To be clear, the President did not himself personally send those tax returns?MR. SPICER: No, and I think its offensive to ask that question. And I think that, frankly, how NBC News handled this, and the idea that they made a spectacle of it just shows how desperate they are for ratings.Q  And then to follow up on that. I mean, last night, as that report was about to come out, the White House released a statement that included two numbers: the amount that the President paid in taxes -- income taxes -- that year, and then his full income. I want to understand why, during the campaign, a move was never made to just release those numbers, and would the White House consider releasing those numbers for maybe the past 10 years?MR. SPICER: Number one, those numbers were obtained and released to us illegally. They were provided to us by them, to ask us for comment. But to sort of use one illegal act, and then say we should act further on that is somewhat preposterous. The President has asked and answered this issue over and over again throughout the campaign and multiple times since hes been President.So the issue still stands. And I think to use the fruit to talk about, well, because they obtained one year illegally, we should respond in kind with several years is preposterous.Q  Sean, can I ask you, with these tax returns, do you know if these 2005 numbers were under audit?MR. SPICER: I dont. I dont know.Q  Can I ask you, separate -- Republicans and Democrats in the House Intel Committee said today they still dont have any evidence of wiretapping. Will the President apologize to former President Obama for this? They still have no evidence of this.MR. SPICER: I think what Chairman Nunes said is twofold. One is that he said he did not have anything at this time. Two is that he said that can understand that the President has tweeted that there is a lot there with regarding surveillance during the cycle. And again, I think this is -- the Department of Justice asked for an additional week to provide information. We are still at the beginning stages of this. We asked both the House and Senate to look into this. We hope they will. We believe that they will have further updates as they go through this process.But, again, these two individuals today were making comments on where we stand right now. And I think, as we go through the process, I think as I mentioned yesterday, the President feels very comfortable that there is information out there regarding surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election.Q  Sean, follow-up: Nunes said, I dont think there was an actual tap of Trump Tower. Youve broadened it to surveillance. Does the White House still believe that there was a wiretap of Trump Tower?MR. SPICER: I answered this question two days ago in the briefing, and the President has discussed this. I think its something that he was asked by Tucker Carlson, and hell answer it tonight. But he was very clear that, you know, he used the wiretap, generally. He put it in quotes, to mean that it counts for surveillance and all types of activity of that sort.Q  Sean, can I ask you about the healthcare plan? Republicans on the Hill today were saying that they had gotten some sense that you guys had accepted changes to that plan. Are there --MR. SPICER: Well, I think one of the things that Ill say is that the President has been very clear -- Ive mentioned this from the briefing room several times; Director Mulvaney and Director Price have mentioned it as well -- that we want to work with the House to achieve the best outcome. And if members have ideas --I know that theres talk of a managers amendment, and were obviously in talks with Speaker Ryan and the entire leadership team over there, and is Director Mulvaney and Secretary Price to get the best outcome based on the feedback from members.But thats why he continues to bring in groups of senators, groups of House members -- to have those discussions, to find out if we can achieve the best outcome.Q  But at this point, have you agreed to anything that would go in the managers amendment?MR. SPICER: I dont -- Im not privy to -- this is not -- once we have a managers amendment that we can talk about, we will. But there is an ongoing discussion about areas that we can get to. And again, one of the points that I talked about in the briefing yesterday is theres a lot of ideas out there, and I think, at the end of the day, we have to make sure that all of those ideas continue to the goal of growing the vote from 218 up.There are some ideas that while have merit and may have a lot of support dont have enough merit -- have support to help grow the bill or have a majority support, and thats important when youre looking at trying to pass legislation through the House or the Senate.Q  Sounds like there are some things that you can rule out then? Can you tell us whats definitely not going to be in there?MR. SPICER: Again, this is something that was an ongoing process with the House at this time, and I'm sure we'll go through it with the Senate as well. And I don't want to sit here and prejudge where we are at this stage because it is ongoing.Q  Just to follow up on that, do you believe, does the White House believe there are enough votes in the Senate right now for HCA to pass?MR. SPICER: I think, obviously, the focus is -- I don't mean to sound evasive, but the first goal is to get it through the House, and then to worry about the Senate. I think until you have a product that comes out of the House with a managers amendment that the Speaker is working on, theres not something necessarily that every senator can fully make a determination as to how their vote is. I think theyve started to talk. There was a group over yesterday, as you're well aware -- Senator Cruz, Senator Sasse, Senator Strange, several others -- that provided their input to staff as far as things that theyd like to see. Staff is going to continue to work on that.Remember that as that bill leaves the House it will be an opportunity for senators to have their say as well. And so this is part of a legislative process.Q  On a separate subject, some members of Congress have asked for James Comey to say one way or another whether theres an investigation into the campaign and Russia ties. Does the White House, does the President believe that for the sake of clarity that James Comey should be more specific about whether an investigation exists?MR. SPICER: I'm not going to interfere with those discussions. I think that's up to -- I don't want to get in the middle of Congress and their request. So I'll leave that up to Director Comey and to Congress to determine whats appropriate.Q  Does the President want to know whether an investigation exists?Q  Does he know?MR. SPICER: I think theres an area -- it's not a question of one, Abby, it's a question of we've made it clear what we -- how we think this has to happen. I think whats important to note is that every single member that I'm aware of that has publicly come out that has been briefed has said that there is nothing, no connection between the campaign and Russia. And I think we have to be very clear that there are two issues. Theres always been a discussion in the IC community network about Russian activity. Then theres the bigger issue that the media has been obsessed with, which is whether or not there was a connection between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Every single person that has been briefed on that secondary matter has said that theyve seen nothing there, including Director Clapper, including others that have been briefed by Director Comey -- Senator Cotton, Senator Burr, Senator -- Chairman Nunes -- over and over again. And, again, it's interesting that when we talk about proof -- as far as the previous question on wiretapping -- I don't know how much more proof that we can get in terms of the number of people that have been briefed that have said that when it comes to involvement with Russia theres nothing that they -- that has been shown to anybody who was aware of the situation.And so I don't know how many times we have to answer this question before people who have been briefed come up with the same conclusion that theres nothing there.Q  Did the President meet with the Mayor of Flint today? Did that meeting take place?MR. SPICER: I believe he did speak with her briefly before they departed. Q  Do you know if he raised a question in the listening session about lead in paint and whether the paint are still as good given the lead regulations? Do you know at all where his thinking is coming from on that, any thoughts about --MR. SPICER: I don't. I don't.Q  -- of what the two of them discussed during their meeting?MR. SPICER: It wasnt a meeting -- I mean, it was on the way out, the President met with several individuals and he had an opportunity to talk to them about -- just thanking them, and it was a brief conversation.Q  -- the President request for the two of them to spend some time together?MR. SPICER: -- follow up from the last time that he had been in Flint, so I'm not exactly sure what the nature of how it came to be. I can ask a little bit from our staff how that came to be, but I know that they wanted a chance to say hi.Q  On the CAFE regulations, the President kind of sounded like he believed that fuel efficiency regulations shouldnt get in the way of auto companies creating more cars. Does he have an opinion on where those fuel efficiency regulations ought to be? Does he think that they are too high?MR. SPICER: Just to be clear, I think one of the things that's interesting -- and I know there was a briefing for you guys on this -- that what the Obama administration did is rush through a process that they had promised the automakers and, frankly, the unions as well as far as how this determination would be. Right now we've got three entities looking at efficiency and emission standards. I think what the President actually went back to is say that we are going to follow on the process that the Obama administration originally had promised those automakers and unions. That's simply it -- is agreeing to a process that had been agreed to early on.Q  He hasn't himself prejudged what he would like the outcome to be?MR. SPICER: No. He said it very clearly during his remarks that all he wanted to do was return to the promise that was made to these individuals. Thank you guys very much. Return to your seats and hopefully you can stay safe.END4:43 P.M. EDT",20950.1,112.72999999999956,5900.05,43.23000000000047,2385.26,19.8100000000004

342,2017-03-15,Press Briefing by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney Previewing the President's FY18 Budget,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room11:27 A.M. EDTMR. CZWARTACKI: Good morning. This is Director Mulvaneys review of the 2018 budget blueprint. I want to reiterate again that this is on background -- this is embargoed. His remarks are on the record, but embargoed until 12:01 tomorrow, or in other words, tonight. 12:01 a.m. is -- until the embargo is holding. And with that, Director Mulvaney will come up. He will be on the record, and have a few words. Thank you.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks, John. And I apologize, Im going to try and speak a little bit more loudly than I ordinarily do. They tell me theres folks on the phone who cant hear. So if you hear me projecting a little more than normal, thats for the benefit of the folks who arent here.Thanks for coming. I apologize for being a few minutes late. The simple message is fairly straightforward. Youve heard from me before, so Ill make a very brief comment, and then well take your questions, which is: This is the ""America First"" budget. In fact, we wrote it using the Presidents own words. We went through his speeches, we went through articles that have been written about his policies, we talked to him, and we wanted to know what his policies were, and we turned those policies into numbers. So you have an ""America First"" candidate, you have an ""America First"" budget.Knowing what you know about the President, you could imagine what that budget would look like before you even see it, which is that there will be more money on defense -- $54 billion. We could talk about more of that in a second. Theres more money for enforcing security at the border. Theres more money for enforcing laws on the books just generally. Then theres more money for things like private and public school choice. Conversely, since the President wanted to do that without adding to the already-projected $488 billion deficit in fiscal year 2018, there were reductions elsewhere to offset dollar for dollar, all of those increases. So we say, plus-up the defense topline number by $54 billion. You will, in other parts of the budget, find a corresponding $54 billions worth of reductions. So the President accomplishes his priorities without adding to the deficit. Thats not to say the balance of the budget is balanced next year. It doesnt. Weve simply not added to the deficit in order to accomplish these policies.As a result, youll see reductions exactly where you would expect it from a President who just ran on an ""America First"" campaign. Youll see reductions in the State Department. Well talk more about that in a second. Youll see reductions in the EPA. In fact, you'll see reductions in many agencies as he tries to shrink the role of government, drive efficiencies, go after waste, duplicative programs, those types of things. If he said it on the campaign, its in the budget.I'll talk about the defense line for a second. Weve worked very closely with the Defense Department to make sure a couple of things -- that this funds their needs, but does so in a responsible fashion in terms of what they can actually spend this year. The Defense Department has told us this is the amount of money they need and can spend effectively this year. We're not throwing money after a problem and claiming that we have fixed it. The Defense Department has given us every assurance they can spend -- this full $54 billion -- next year in a responsible fashion. And I believe General Mattis when he tells me that.Regarding some of the reductions, youll see a fairly dramatic reduction in State Department. That is not a commentary on the Presidents policies towards the State Department. That is a comment on the Presidents policies towards whats in their budget. The foreign aid line items in the budget, many of them, just happen to fall within the State Department functions. The President ran saying he would spend less money overseas and more money back home. So when you go to implement that policy, you go to things like foreign aid, and those get reduced. If those had been in the Department of Education, youd see a more dramatic decrease in education. If they had been in energy, youd see the decrease there. It just so happens, under the way we spend money in this country, that the foreign aid line items fall within State Department. So I think the number youre going to see in the State Department is fairly significant. Off the top of my head, its 28 percent reduction.Anyway, I can take some questions. Well go through the specifics, and I think were releasing the document when?AIDE: 7:00 a.m. tomorrow. DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sorry?AIDE: 7:00 a.m.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: 7:00 A.M. tomorrow morning. Yes, sir.Q  You said that you went through the Presidents speeches and this reflects that. The President, also during the campaign, had railed against the national debt, which is approaching $20 trillion. I know you say youre not adding to projected deficits, but yet you are willing to take on deficits of hundreds of billions of dollars. And my basic question is why, if the President railed against the national debt that keeps on skyrocketing?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, and Im sorry. Should I repeat the question for the benefit of the people who are gone, or should I -- okay, for the people who are not here, the question relates to debt. And if I was going to paraphrase, the President railed against the deficits, yet doesnt reduce them in this blueprint. Is that your question?Q  Yeah, I mean, the national debt keeps rising and --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thats fine. So the national debt keeps going up. Why then havent we done something about that in the blueprint? Is that an accurate restatement of your question, more or less? And I apologize if I butchered that.The answer is pretty simple, which is that this is a budget blueprint, not a complete budget. So what you will not see here: You will not see revenue projections, you will not see larger policy statements, and, importantly, you will not see anything having to do with mandatory spending. And anybody who looks at the deficit and knows the issues of the deficit knows that you cannot balance the deficit in the discretionary budget. The balance budget is not balanced this year. We expect the budget deficit to be roughly the $488 billion for FY2018, as estimated by the CBO, and were assuming that to be the case.The Presidents commentary on deficits, though, that is contained in this budget blueprint is that he wanted to accomplish all of the things I just laid out regarding defense, immigration, law enforcement, VA benefits and education, without adding to the deficit. All right? In previous administrations, what they would do is they would lay out their priorities and all that money would be borrowed, and they would increase the deficit. Whatever the deficit happened to be that year would go up by that Presidents priorities. Thats not the case here.Yes, sir.Q  Can you walk us through the 28 percent reduction at the State Department?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, we can go through it tomorrow. I mentioned that number because I think there was some numbers that were leaked that were different than that, and I make that point to say that they werent accurate. I will say this, John, which is that we believe that we have protected the core diplomatic function of State. And thats why I say this is not a reflection of the Presidents policies regarding an attitude towards State. The President believes very strongly in what Mr. Tillerson is doing, and I think Mr. Tillerson has already had at least one dramatic success since hes been here in the agreements he reached with Iraq. What you see in the State Department budget is the reflection of the reductions in the foreign aid programs. You have a follow-up on that?Q  Yes, can you give us some other idea of percentage reductions across some of the other agencies?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, because I cant remember them off the top of my head. I know the Defense Department was up ten, I believe that Homeland was up six, and I cannot remember -- and a lot of them were in the ten to twelve range, but, again, I dont remember the list off the top of my head.Yes, sir.Q  On the EPA, my understanding is that 25 percent cut roughly -- 24, 25 -- proposed $2 billion, about 3,000 jobs. Scott Pruitt did not quarrel with those figures at a macro level. There were a couple of disagreements on environmental cleanup that basically said, yes, we're happy with this. The (inaudible) internally. Now there are discussions about making even deeper cuts to the EPA. Could you talk a little bit about that?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: A couple things, yeah. We absolutely believe, again, as with State, that the core functions of the EPA can be satisfied -- in fact, beyond the core functions can be satisfied with this budget. We've worked very closely with Mr. Pruitt. He's done a tremendous job to try and prioritize things over at the EPA. And we worked with him on those priorities. Regarding job reductions, you mentioned 3,000 people. I will tell you the same thing that I told Mr. Pruitt and told the other agencies, which is, we will work with you -- which is a different process this year. Ordinarily, a President's budget will come and say, you were going to spend this amount of money and you were going to take the reductions over there. And that's not how that this President worked. We did set the topline numbers, worked with some of the agencies on adjusting some of those numbers as they saw fit. But we have given them a tremendous amount of flexibility within their own agencies this year. So I can't -- I wouldnt comment on the number of proposed job reductions, because ultimately it will fall to Mr. Pruitt to how to implement those topline numbers. Q  And that's the point I've been told. But what I want to understand is, how much more aggressive a topline level are you discussing in terms of -- right now it's at about that $2-billion-level. How much more aggressive? DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can't remember the line-item reduction of the EPA, and I dont have the document in front of me.Let me go in the back, and then I'll come back. And I understand people on the phone can't ask questions.Q  Can I just ask, what exactly are we going to see tomorrow? Are we going to see agency-level funding? Will there be any fiscal year '17 numbers? And will there be a supplemental for this?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: So three questions is one question.Q  Yes. (Laughter.) DIRECTOR MULVANEY: That's okay. Q  What are we going to see tomorrow?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: All right. The question is, what are we going to see tomorrow, and then I'll go ahead and answer the '17 budget. And then what was your other one?Q  Supplemental.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Supplemental. Okay. Thank you very much. All right, what are you going to see tomorrow? You're going to see the actual budget blueprint, which will hit the highlights. It will show you the total funding for the agency, and there will be bullet points on each one as to where we might have plus-up spending, and also details on where we've lowered spending. You will not see a --Q  For each department and agency.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: You will not a see a spreadsheet that goes line by line to the budget. Again, that's up to the agencies to implement. FY17 will be rolled out at the same time, so we'll be talking about that. I met with Senate appropriators over the course of the last couple weeks. I met with several of the House appropriators yesterday. And we will be rolling out '17 Thursday, as well. What day of the week is it, folks?Q  Wednesday.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Is it Wednesday? So when I say Thursday, what I mean is tomorrow. (Laughter.) More importantly, the day before St. Patrick's Day, which is all that really counts. Regarding the supplemental -- yes, part of our '17 request will include a supplemental request -- $30 billion for defense and primarily border. That includes $1.5 billion for the wall this year. There will be money in the FY2018 money for a wall, as well, as you can possibly imagine. And the '17 proposals that we have sort of dovetail into the '18. So by the same token, there's also proposed reductions in '17. So if you took sort of '18 and compressed it into a little version of '17, which you'll see in '17 follows the same sort of general outline: more spending on defense, more spending on border enforcement, some other line items, and also reductions elsewhere, and money for the wall.Yes, ma'am, I told you I'd come back there.Q  Can you speak to how you try to balance policy? The President also talked about projecting strength in the world. So if you have this dramatic reduction at State, and sometimes foreign aid is used to try to bring stability to parts of the world that could be a threat, how did you find that balance so that 28 percent, which sounds so substantial, where are you comfortable with the potential risk of reducing that aid?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure. There's no question this is a hard-power budget. It is not a soft-power budget. This is a hard-power budget. And that was done intentionally. The President very clearly wants to send a message to our allies and our potential adversaries that this is a strong power administration. So you have seen money move from soft-power programs, such as foreign aid, into more hard-power programs. That's what our allies can expect, that's what our adversaries can expect, that's what the President wanted us to relay. And I think we've done an effective job of that.Q  Is he (inaudible)?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I implement the President's policies. The President decides what he wants to do, and we put it into practice, and that's what this budget does.Yes, sir.Q  Sir, you talked about the budget being an ""America First"" budget and taking what the President campaigned on on the trail, and turning that into budgetary policy. And one agency you havent mentioned is HUD, but we understand there's going to be some significant cuts in HUD, as well. Can you just explain how the President's promise on the campaign trail to fix the inner cities and rebuild a lot of those communities fits with cutting grant programs and other housing programs?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure. A couple different answers to that. First off, one of the other things the President said was he was going to go after wasteful programs, duplicative programs, programs that simply dont work. And a lot of those are in HUD. We've spent a lot of money on Housing and Urban Development over the last decades without a lot to show for it. Certainly there are some successes, but there's a lot of programs that simply cannot justify their existence, and that's where we zeroed in.To the larger issue about how do you want to work with the inner cities, a lot of the other President's policies -- education, for example -- speak to his work that he wants to see done in the inner cities. Plus, dont discount -- by the way, this is a larger point -- dont discount the infrastructure program, as well. You will see reductions, for example, in other agencies on infrastructure programs. And people might say, well, goodness gracious, that doesnt line up with what the President said about a commitment to infrastructure. That was done intentionally. The Department of Transportation, you'll see some line-item reductions for infrastructure programs. Why? Because we believe those programs to be less efficient than the infrastructure package that we're working on for later on this year. So what we've effectively done is try to move money out of existing, more inefficient programs, and hold that money for what we expect to be more efficient infrastructure programs later on.Q  Are you then funding any new programs that the President thinks are going to be more efficient or better or changed --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: We moved money around in HUD, but I dont think we created any new programs. Again, I talked to Secretary Carson, and he has the flexibility to move money around, so I would think that -- Secretary Carson came to us, came to the President more specifically, and said, look, you gave me this pot of money, I want to move money out of this existing program into this new idea I have. He would have a tremendous flexibility to do that. In fact, thats why President Trump appointed him and everybody else to those types of positions.Yes, sir. In the back.Q  You said $1.5 billion for the wall. Is that the first step, given that this --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, its all that we think that we can spend this year. We havent settled on a -- and the next question is going to be, how many miles of wall does that build, right? And we dont know the answer to that question because we havent settled on construction types. We havent settled on where were going to start. I think the funding provides for a couple of different pilot cases. I dont know what else to describe them -- as different kinds of barriers in different kinds of places, as we try and find the most cost-efficient, the safest, and also the most effective border protections. They may be different in different areas.So the $1.5 billion allows us to start that program. We come along with additional funding -- $2.6 [billion] in 2018 -- and obviously when we get to that fuller budget -- the fuller budget, thats not a very good word -- when we get to the full budget in May, youll also start seeing some projections out in throughout the 10-year window.Yes, sir.Q  So all of your increases are offset on the other side. Does it add up? Or are you making extra room for tax cuts in there?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, sir. This is apples to apples. This is discretionary budget only. So if we spend an extra dollar on a discretionary program within this blueprint, we reduced a dollar within discretionary someplace else in the blueprint. We have not gone to tax policy. We have not gone to mandatory spending. We have not gone outside of that wedge. You all have seen the graph about the $4 trillion we spend. A trillion dollars of it is discretionary funding. This blueprint stays entirely within those lanes.Q  So you get the money for tax cuts solely out of the repeal and replace of Obamacare, or what?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, I mean, again, were not addressing -- this is not a tax policy document. This is a discretionary spending budget. That may be a question better asked once we start formulating specific details on tax policy. Yes, maam.Q  Where is the money for the wall coming from?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: From the general treasury.Q  Okay, so you cant give us any specifics on what programs its moving out of?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Oh, no, its not -- Im sorry, thats okay. Thats a fair question. The question is, ""Where is the money from the wall coming from?"" And I thought you were asking me if it was coming from Mexico, and its coming out of the Treasury. (Laughter.) No, we did not say, okay, we need $1.5 billion for the wall, lets go over and reduce this program over at Education, and move that $1.5 billion over to the wall. We dealt with it more holistically. We plussed-up the various items I've talked about, and then we went looking for the most inefficient, most wasteful, most indefensible programs in other areas. So you couldnt follow it dollar for dollar. But when you put it all together in a whole, they offset dollar for dollar.Yes, maam.Q  Two questions. One, the federal workforce, in general -- can you talk about any numbers in terms of reductions?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, because its going to up to -- theres a great deal of discretion, more so than is typical for the various agency secretaries.Q  Okay, and second question: Theres been some leaks about Coast Guard reductions, and I just wondered, if thats true, how that squares with border security, because obviously that also helps.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Regarding the Department of Homeland Security budget, as I think I mentioned earlier, the DHS budget, I think, is increased about 6 percent. There was a leak, I think, about a discontinuation or a proposed discontinuation of a Coast Guard cutter. That wasnt -- thats not accurate. So DHS actually has a 6 percent increase.Yes, sir.Q  Is the Coast Guard being reduced overall?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Again, its sort of hard to say because the Department of Homeland -- is it a secretary or is it a director? I cant remember. Its secretary, thanks. Im sort of new at this -- will have discretion as to how he wants to -- General Kelly will have -- Secretary Kelly will have the discretion as to how he wants to allocate.In the back, with the computer. Yes, sir.Q  In the Presidents address to Congress, two of the sort of grander things he touched on were both curing diseases and exploring other planets. So with that in mind, what are NIH and NASA potentially looking at in this budget? And then, second question: Does anything in this budget assume the passage of the AHCA?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: To the last question, no. The question is, does this budget assume passage of the Affordable Care Act. There may be some places that are sort of ancillary to the ACA, where we went in and pulled them. But generally speaking, the answer is no. That would be reflected in the larger budget that we do in May.Regarding curing diseases and exploring other planets, the overall NASA budget, I think, is reduced by a very small number. I think its 1 percent. Is that right? One percent. But a lot of the programs within there are actually increased in order to align with the Presidents priorities, and that includes some of the exploring other planets. I think we changed one of the missions to a moon at Saturn or Jupiter, but I cant remember the details on that. But the general response is, yes, to the extent it was consistent with what the President wanted us to do, and space exploration is part of his priorities. Those programs actually are increased within the NASA budget which is reduced by a very small amount at the topline number -- 1 percent. Last time, curing diseases -- I thought that was a tremendous part of the speech. Its something Ive talked about for the last couple years when I was in the House. The young woman who was there has what we call an orphan disease, which is a disease that not that many people have, and but for federal funding, that research for those diseases will not take place. Theres not enough people who have that disease in order to encourage the free market to develop a cure, because if they did, not enough people can buy it. And our budget preserves the ability to do exactly that.Yes, sir.Q  When you say that anyone who seriously looks at the budget knows you cant balance it without going after entitlement programs --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Going after is not the word I would use, but go ahead.Q  Fair enough. Okay, without dealing with entitlement programs. Is that -- obviously, the President has promised not to make changes in Social Security and Medicare. So are you saying hes not going to balance the budget, or are you saying, once you explain the budget to him, hes going to change his position on those?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: What I've said, and I think I've said a couple times, is that the FY2018 will not balance, okay? We are looking at a $488 billion --Q  I'm talking about --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: It's way too early, and, really, I'm not trying to dodge your question, but we've been focusing on this. We will not know where we are within that 10-year budget window, which is that traditional sort of perspective we put it in when we talk about a House budget or a Senate budget or an executive budget, we look at the 10-year window. We're not ready yet to start talking about that. That will be contained in the May document.Q  But do you anticipate that you are going to be able to -- and others are going to be able to persuade him to change his position on those thing, which is what the Speaker has said?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can confirm for you the President is going to keep the promises he kept regarding those programs.Yes, sir, you had a question.Q  One is a rather narrow and the other is pretty broad. The narrow question is, are you guys going to zero out funding for the Corporation of Public Broadcasting?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes.Q  Zero out?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, I'm sorry, I was too quick with that. No, we propose ending funding, but technically what you'll see -- is that one of the $121 million ones? I think it is. Corporation of Public Broadcasting? Yes, it's -- you'll see it's an elimination, but you'll see an amount of money in that budget, and that is for -- it is actually a sum amount of money that's necessary for us to unwind our involvement with the CPB. So you won't see a zero next to it. But the policy is that we're ending federal involvement with the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.Q  Over a period of years.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Well, this year. Q  This year?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Probably next year you might see it be zero, but it may take a while to unwind that relationship. It's just the nature of contracts and so forth.You had a more general comment?Q  The broad question was, there was a piece in the paper this week that suggested that we're in for the largest reduction of proposed reduction of the federal workforce since World War II. Can you speak to the concerns in this area about the impact on property values and the Washington reception?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I work for the President of the United States. The President of the United States, he represents the District of Columbia, Northern Virginia, and Southern Maryland, but he also represents the rest of the country. And I can assure you that we did not write this budget with an eye towards what it would do to the value of your condo. (Laughter.) Yes, ma'am. Q  Or Trump properties I'm sure you mean in there, too. When it comes to -- I'm trying to get my hands around when you emphasized foreign aid cut, to emphasize that phrase. There are some soft-power things the State Department does that are in concert with DOD, like military training programs or food aid that U.S. Marines go out and deliver. Are you essentially moving those things from State to DOD? Or are these just hard cuts to entire programs?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Let me see if I can answer it this way. It's a technical answer, and I'm not sure it will satisfy you, but this is how we look at it in the budget world. The 050 function, which is what we call defense -- there's a line item in the budget which is 050 -- that goes well beyond just the Department of Defense. There are defense-related functions in many agencies. The easiest example to think of -- and this is actually applicable to this year's blueprint -- is inside the Department of Energy is a 050 section for the nuclear arsenal. The 050 is what got plussed-up $54 billion. So it's not just within the Pentagon. In fact, we did increase the 050 spending at the Department of Energy for the nuclear triad. So to the extent your question is, are 050 functions within the State Department part of the increase, the answer is yes. But I can't speak to where individual programs fall in terms of whether or not they're 050 or not.Q  So when you are emphasizing foreign aid, you are not including those programs. Can you explain what you mean you think you're cutting? Or is that all up to Tillerson to decide?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: When you see the blueprint, we identify the specific names. And I dont want to get lazy, and I dont want to be sloppy with which programs are identified. But you'll see specific programs within the State Department budget that we do reduce, and that may answer your question.Q  A clarification. Twenty-eight percent reduction at State, is that across State or just --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, sir, that's across State.Q  The State reduction, do you have a dollar figure on that? And is State the largest dollar-figure reduction by any agency? What gets you the farthest along to the $54 billion?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I can't remember, and I honestly dont want to guess in terms of either the percentage or the dollar figure. And I apologize -- again, I just dont -- that will be readily knowable to you in the document tomorrow, and I dont want to misspeak.Yes, ma'am, for the last one.Q  I just wanted to ask you a little bit more about the EPA cuts and specifically enforcing the Paris climate change agreement. Obviously, the President has said he doesnt support that. What cuts would impact enforcement on that? I mean, because that goes to the Clean Power Plan, that goes to CAFE standards, and I know there's going to be an announcement today. And then, of course, there's the Green Climate Fund that the President -- the last President committed to fund. And I dont know if that was going through EPA; I think it was going through appropriations. But would that be cut as part of this budget movement?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I dont want to speak to specific line items in there, because, again, I dont want to misspeak. But I'll answer your question this way, which is that you can expect reductions in the EPA that dont line up with the President's view on things like global warming and alternative energies. So you will see a reduction in subsidies, a reduction in participation, and those types of programs. I won't speak specifically to the Paris accords because I dont know off the top of my head what that involves in terms of the line items in the budget. But to the extent there are reductions at EPA, and they are, and they are significant, you could expect that that would be one of the places where we focused heavily.Look, I'm going to stop this, because, quite frankly, my mouth is dry and I need a glass of water -- (laughter) -- but I dont want a Marco Rubio. But I'll be coming back again to do this tomorrow at --Q  You'll join Sean.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: At 1 o'clock it's Sean, and then by then you'll have that chance to look at the blueprint and ask specific questions.Thank you all very much.END11:53 A.M.

343,2017-03-15,ICYMI: The Health Bill’s Fiscal Bonus,"The best chance in a generation to control a runaway government.The Health Bills Fiscal BonusThe Wall Street JournalEditorialThe furor over the Congressional Budget Offices report on the House GOP health bill is concentrated on predictions about insurance coverage, which suits Democrats fine. Lost amid the panic is that CBO shows the bill is a far-reaching advance for the market principles and limited government that conservatives usually favor.The CBO is not omniscient, but if its projections are even close to accurate then ObamaCare repeal and replacement is the most significant government reform in perhaps three decades. Under conventional (static-revenue) scoring, the bill cuts spending on net by $1.22 trillion and eliminates a raft of new taxes worth $883 billion through 2026.Despite this tax reform and new refundable tax credits for individual insurance purchases, the bill still reduces the deficit by $337 billion. Reducing spending, the tax burden and further debt generation is an enormous pro-growth fiscal bonus.Absent reform, the brutal budget math is that the U.S. is headed for a debt crisis; major tax increases that subtract from GDP and living standards; or deep and immediate cuts to entitlements that Americans have planned their lives aroundor maybe all three. The longer Washington waits, the more painful and politically convulsive the corrections will be.Taxpayers will save $880 billion in Medicaid alone over the decade as states search for efficiencies. Relative to current law, thats a 17.6% cut over 10 years. In 2026 Medicaid will be 25% smaller than the CBO otherwise projects on present trend.The health-care bill also zeroes out almost all ObamaCare tax increases. The targets include the 10-year, $144.7 billion tax on the health insurance industry, which is merely passed through to consumers, and the $19.6 billion medical device excise tax, which undermines life-saving innovation.Conservative critics are discounting these and other benefits because the bill isnt everything they imagine, but theyre missing the larger and rarer opportunity. ObamaCare was designed to expand over time, reaching deeper and deeper into the middle class and displacing ever-more private health insurance. This private market decomposition has been slower than expected because the Obama Administration botched the laws design.If conservatives fumble this repeal-and-replace moment, they wont get another chance. And theyll have squandered their best opening in a generation to control the size and scope of the federal Leviathan.Read the entire article here",20950.1,112.72999999999956,5900.05,43.23000000000047,2385.26,19.8100000000004

Trump and Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman reaffirmed their support for a strong, broad, and enduring strategic partnership based on a shared interest and commitment to the stability and prosperity of the Middle East region. They directed their teams to explore additional steps across a broad range of political, military, security, economic, cultural, and social dimensions to further strengthen and elevate the United States-Saudi strategic relationship for the benefit of both countries. U.S. and Saudi officials intend to consult on additional steps to deepen commercial ties and promote investment, and to expand cooperation in the energy sector. The President and the Deputy Crown Prince noted the importance of confronting Iran's destabilizing regional activities while continuing to evaluate and strictly enforce the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The President expressed his strong desire to achieve a comprehensive, just, and lasting settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to continue the two countries consultations to help reach solutions for regional issues. More broadly, the President and Deputy Crown Prince noted the ongoing security and military cooperation between the two countries in confronting Daesh/ISIS and other transnational terrorist organizations that pose a threat to all nations.The two countries announced their determination to strengthen their cooperation in the economic, commercial, investment, and energy fields, with the aim of realizing growth and prosperity in the two countries and the global economy. President Trump provided his support for developing a new United States-Saudi program, undertaken by joint U.S.-Saudi working groups, and its unique initiatives in energy, industry, infrastructure, and technology worth potentially more than $200 billion in direct and indirect investments within the next four years. The President also provided his support for United States investments in Saudi Arabia and the facilitation of bilateral trade, which will result in sizable opportunities for both countries. On energy, the two countries affirmed their desire to continue bilateral consultations in a way that enhances the growth of the global economy and limits supply disruption and market volatility.The two countries highlighted that expanded economic cooperation could create as many as one million direct American jobs within the next four years, millions of indirect American jobs, as well as jobs in Saudi Arabia. The Deputy Crown Prince reviewed Saudi Arabias Vision 2030 program for the President and agreed to put in place specific bilateral programs to help both countries benefit from new opportunities created by the Kingdoms implementation of those new economic plans.",20950.1,112.72999999999956,5900.05,43.23000000000047,2385.26,19.8100000000004

348,2017-03-15,"Remarks by President Trump at American Center for Mobility | Detroit, MI","Detroit, Michigan2:37 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. It is truly great to be back here in Michigan -- great. (Applause.) And its also wonderful to be here with the leaders, workers, engineers and suppliers of Ford, and Fiat-Chrysler, and General Motors, and many others. We have so many leaders that we just met, all of the leaders of the major car companies and really the automobile business. It's a great business, it's a wonderful business, but it's been pretty much hurt here. But it's not going to be hurt for long, that I can tell you. (Applause.) That I can tell you. I'm sure you've all heard the big news that we're going to work on the CAFE standards, so you can make cars in America again. (Applause.) We're going to help the companies, and they're going to help you. There is no more beautiful sight than an American-made car. No more beautiful sight. (Applause.) I love this state, I love the people of this state. And you did me a big favor, because you gave me a victory, and that victory hasnt been won by a Republican in a long time -- long time. (Applause.) And you're going to be very happy, believe me. You're going to be very, very happy. During the campaign, I came to Michigan again and again, and I made this promise, that I am going to fight for your jobs and fight very, very hard. (Applause.) I'm going to fight for Michigan workers. I'm going to fight to keep the automobile production in the United States of America, not outside -- in the United States. (Applause.) And, by the way, for those that have any doubts, many other industries do. That's okay, right? So we're here not simply to honor the past, but to devote ourselves to a new future of American automotive leadership. We want to be the car capital of the world again. We will be. And it won't be long, believe me. (Applause.) And, by the way, we're going to have a very big announcement next week having to do with your industry. Very, very big. Very important. Everybody is saying, ""what is it?"" Let's keep them guessing back there. (Laughter.)  Youve heard me say the words, and Ill repeat them, right now: Buy American and Hire American. (Applause.) Its not just a motto, its a pledge. Its a pledge to the working people of this country. The era of economic surrender for the United States is over -- it's over. And you see what's already been happening: plants are coming back; other plants that were expected to be built in other countries are not being built. I just want to tell the leaders they made some very wise decisions. Very wise. Very wise. (Applause.) Some plants that were announced, they're not going to be built. They're smart.We're going to stand up to foreign cheating. We're going to crack down on currency manipulation. And, yes, we're going to use the full economic powers of our country to protect our workers and to protect our jobs. Let me also say how important it is for me that we have every segment of this great American industry represented in our audience today. We have everybody. To succeed as a country, we have to work together. We have to fight, side-by-side, to protect our industry and to stop the jobs from leaving our country. It's not going to happen anymore, folks. We've gone through it for many, many years, decades. It's not going to happen anymore. And if it is, there's consequences to pay for the companies that desert us and fire our employees. There are consequences. (Applause.) Already, were seeing jobs coming back. Since my election, Ford has announced 700 new jobs coming back to their plant in Flat Rock, Michigan. (Applause.) Fiat-Chrysler has announced that they will create 2,000 new jobs in Michigan and Ohio. (Applause.) And just today -- breaking news -- General Motors announced that they're adding or keeping 900 jobs right here in Michigan, and that's going to be over the next 12 months. And that's just the beginning, folks. In fact, I told them, that's peanuts -- that's peanuts. (Applause.) We're going to have a lot more. They're going to be building new plants, expanding their plants.My administration will work tirelessly to eliminate the industry-killing regulations, to lower the job-crushing taxes, and to ensure a level playing field for all American companies and workers. Before NAFTA went into effect -- by the way, NAFTA, a total disaster -- there were 280,000 autoworkers in Michigan. Today, that number is roughly 165,000 -- and would have been heading down big league if I didnt get elected, I will tell you that right now. That I can tell you. (Applause.) Plenty of things were stopped in their tracks. They were stopped in their tracks. A lot of bad things were going to happen. A lot of places were going to get built that arent going to get built right now in other locations. The number of auto plants in the state has been cut by a third. Motor City once set the standard of living for the nation. Now it has suffered under decades of failed economic decisions that have stripped our country of its jobs and of its wealth. The Trans-Pacific Partnership -- another disaster -- threatened states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and so many others with the loss of countless more jobs. That is why I'm proud to say I followed through on my promise -- and, by the way, many other promises. Youve seen whats happened. Many. (Applause.) And immediately withdrew the United States from the TPP. I kept my word. The assault on the American auto industry, believe me, is over. Its over. (Applause.) Not going to happen anymore.We are setting up a task force in every federal agency to identify and remove any regulation that undermines American auto production and any other kind of production, including the production of high-end, low-end, big, small, every form of automobile and truck.During my first week in office, I brought American auto companies to the White House. Mary Barra is here. Mark Fields is here. Sergio is here, and others. And none of them ever got to see the Oval Office before, because nobody took them into the Oval Office -- our Presidents. They employ tens of thousands of people, but I brought them into the Oval Office because theyre going to be expanding their companies. (Applause.) But they all told me the same thing. They explained that the previous administration promised you a so-called mid-term review of the federal fuel efficiency standards. It was necessary because the standards were set far into the future -- way, way into the future. If the standards threatened auto jobs, then commonsense changes could have and should have been made.Just days before my inauguration, the previous administration cut short the promised mid-term review in an 11th-hour executive action. Today, I am announcing that we are going to cancel that executive action. (Applause.) We are going to restore the originally scheduled mid-term review, and we are going to ensure that any regulations we have protect and defend your jobs, your factories. Were going to be fair. Were going to be fair.This is an issue of deep importance to me. For decades, I have raised the alarm over unfair foreign trade practices that have robbed communities of their wealth and robbed our people of their ability to provide for their families. Theyve stolen our jobs, theyve stolen our companies, and our politicians sat back and watched, hopeless. Not anymore.As a private citizen, I looked, really with sadness, as massive shipments of foreign cars have been dumped onto our shores while those same countries have shut their borders to our cars. We take them -- ""Come on in, folks. Come on in. No tax. Dont worry about it."" We make cars; they dont take us. Not anymore. (Applause.)Since NAFTA was approved, weve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs in the United States. Since China entered the World Trade Organization, weve lost 60,000 factories. Hard to believe. Our trade deficit last year reached nearly $800 billion. Whos making these deals? I can take anybody in the audience -- youll do better, believe me. (Laughter.) These statistics really should have shaken up Washington to do action, but nothing happened. But something did happen -- happened on November 8th. Believe me, it happened. It happened for you. (Applause.) But the politicians made excuses. They have said these chronic trade deficits have helped us to win friends abroad. I dont want friends abroad if thats what its going to take. We dont need friends abroad for that. Do you ever see that, where they said, ""No, no, its good for us because people like us abroad""? They dont like us -- they think were stupid people. (Laughter.) But no friendship is strengthened through economic abuse -- because we have been abused. And no country can long lead the free world if it does not protect its industries and care for its people and protect its borders. (Applause.) America will be respected again, and you, as workers, will be respected again. Believe me, you will be respected again. Soon. Now. I think its already happened.Our great Presidents, from Washington to Jefferson to Jackson to Lincoln, all understood that a great nation must protect its manufacturing, must protect itself from the outside. Today, I will be visiting the home of Andrew Jackson on the 250th anniversary of his birth. And they say my election was most similar to his -- 1828. That's a long time ago. Usually they go back like to this one, or that one, 12 years ago, 16. I mean, 1828, that's a long way. That's a long time ago.In supporting tariffs, Jackson said, I look at the tariff with an eye to the proper distribution of labor, and to revenue, and with a view to discharge our national debt. We owe $20 trillion -- $20 trillion with our policies. America cannot be a wealthy country if special interests game the system to profit from the exodus of our companies and from the exodus of our jobs.We must embrace a new economic model. Lets call it ""The American Model.""  (Applause.)Under this system, we will reduce burdens on our companies and on our businesses. But, in exchange, companies must hire and grow in America. They have to hire and grow in our country. That is how we will succeed and grow together -- American workers and American industry side-by-side. Nobody can beat us, folks. Nobody can beat us. (Applause.) Because whether we are rich or poor, young or old, black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots. (Applause.)Great Americans of all backgrounds built the Arsenal of Democracy -- including the legendary Rosie the Riveter, who worked here at Willow Run. You know that. (Applause.) Seventy-five years ago, during the Second World War, thousands of American workers filled this very building to build the great new airplanes -- the B-24 Liberator. At peak production -- listen to this -- its not the country that we've been watching over the last 20 years -- they were building one B-24 every single hour. (Applause.)  We don't hear that. We don't hear that anymore, do we? Well be back. Well be back soon. Most amazing people.And while thats incredible, its a tribute really to the teamwork, determination, and patriotism that lives on today in each and every one of you. Great people. You're great people. Now, these hundreds of acres that defended our democracy are going to help build the cars and cities of the future. (Applause.) So I ask you -- that's fine because you're right -- (laughter) -- so I ask you today to join me in daring to believe that this facility, this city, and this nation will once again shine with industrial might. (Applause.) I am asking you to place your faith in the American worker and these great American companies. (Applause.) Im also asking you to respect and place your faith in companies from foreign lands that come here to build their product. We love them too, right? We love them too. (Applause.)Im asking all of the companies here today to join us in this new Industrial Revolution. Let us put American workers, American families, and American dreams first once again.May God bless the American worker. May God bless the Motor City. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you, everybody. END2:54 P.M. EDT",20950.1,112.72999999999956,5900.05,43.23000000000047,2385.26,19.8100000000004

350,2017-03-16,Remarks by President Trump and Vice President Pence at St. Patrick's Day Reception,"East Room6:03 P.M. EDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, good evening to you all. Fellow Americans, Irish friends, distinguished guests. I'm Mike Pence and I'm the 48th Vice President of the United States of America. (Applause.) It's my honor, along with my wife, Karen Pence, to welcome you on behalf of the First Family to the White House on this very special occasion.It is such an honor for the two of us to be able to welcome you here and welcome a special guest to the White House, and of course, our host to this podium for this 55-year-old tradition. Since Irish Ambassador John Joseph Hearne left a box of Irelands most famous symbol at the White House in 1952, the shamrock exchange has grown to become a festive sign of enduring friendship during this memorable week, and an eternal bond between the American people and the people of Ireland.Now, the Irish are one of the strongest and most beautiful threads in our national fabric here in the United States. For centuries, the sons and daughters of Ireland have come here from across the Atlantic. More than 32 million Americans now trace their heritage back to the Emerald Isle. And I say with a grateful heart and deep humility, I'm one of them. (Applause.)My grandfather, Richard Michael Cowley*, stepped off a boat onto Ellis Island in 1023. And that's how Michael Richard Pence got to serve in the White House. My grandfather, as the legend of our family says, was told by my great-grandmother that he needed to go to America. She said, theres a future there for you. He wouldn't see his mother for 25 years, and he often spoke of their separation with a heavy heart.My grandfather came here, like so many generations of Irish-Americans did, with a dream, but with character and with work ethic and a determination to build a family, a good name. And so he did.My mother, who is 83 years young, bright red hair and blue eyes, is still with us today, and his memory and her influence continues to define my life,The truth is my grandfather was very typical of the millions that would come to these shores. He embodied all that's best about the Irish -- sturdy work ethic, faith in God, love of family, patriotism. And those are the enduring contributions of people of Irish descent in the history of this country. It's extraordinary to think of the contributions that the Irish have made. In every single American conflict since our Revolutionary War, the Irish people have enriched America in incalculable ways, and they always will.When I speak of those character qualities I know that they apply to the two people that we have the privilege of introducing tonight. First is our special guest -- it's my high honor to invite him to the podium, along with our host. So, ladies and gentlemen, please join me in welcoming the Taoiseach of the Republic of Ireland, Enda Kenny; his wife, Fionnuala; and my friend, the 45th President of the United States of America, Donald Trump. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. It's a great honor.Taoiseach, Mrs. Kenny, Ambassador Anderson, Dr. Lowe, Vice President Pence, and distinguished guests, we gather here today in the White House to take part in the traditional Shamrock Ceremony and to celebrate the strong ties between the United States and a truly great country, Ireland.I also want to extend a special welcome to a group of distinguished local political and society leaders -- and they are real leaders -- who are with us from Northern Ireland -- great people -- including the Mayor of Belfast and the Head of Northern Ireland Civil Service -- that's a lot of power there. (Laughter.) Lord Mayor Kingston and Sir Malcolm McKibbin -- and it's wonderful to have you. Where are you folks? Where are you? Where are you? (Applause.) Thank you. Theyre going to be having a great open championship very soon -- you know that, right? (Laughter.) At a great course. At a great, great course.St. Patricks Day has become a truly important occasion in the United States -- one embraced by Americans of all faiths and of all backgrounds. I've been to many of them and we love it. The Shamrock Ceremony is a tradition that symbolizes the bond between our two countries. It dates back to 1952 when the Irish Ambassador to the United States, John Joseph Hearne, sent a box of shamrocks to a President who did a very good job -- Harry S. Truman.Our strong ties go back throughout American history. Irish-Americans played a vital role in preserving our Union during its hour of greatest need. So true, played a very, very big role. Many distinguished themselves in the American Civil War with their grit and their bravery and their courage, earning the nickname, the Fighting Irish. And I know a lot about the Irish -- they fight. Theyre tough. (Laughter.) I know a lot. I know more than I'm ever going to tell you. (Laughter.)And when American Armed Forces joined the fight in Europe during World War II, 75 years ago, our heroic troops first stepped off ships in Belfast Harbor in Northern Ireland.Throughout the centuries, hardworking Irish-Americans contributed mightily to Americas innovation and to Americas prosperity. They often overcame great hardship -- really, I mean, it's like the hardship they overcame for us, for our people, is inspiring and really helped a relatively young nation beyond what anyone really understands or knows. So we want to thank you -- just an amazing, an amazing history.President John F. Kennedy, in an address to the Irish Parliament, said that It is that quality of the Irish -- that remarkable combination of hope, confidence, and imagination -- that is needed more than ever today. Now, he said that a long time ago, but it's perhaps even more true today. The words of Americas first Irish-Catholic President ring just as true.We hope confidence -- and I tell you what we want now is a lot of things, but we need that great Irish confidence -- and they are confident people, aren't they, Mike? (Applause.) And I tell you what, we all want it together to grow in the 21st century. And grow we will. As I say, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.We must have the hope to believe in a better future, the confidence to pursue it, and the imagination to figure out how to get there. A new optimism is sweeping across our nation. You see that when you look at the numbers -- the optimism is at the highest level in many, many years. And as America gains renewed strength, Ireland will find us to be an ever-faithful partner and an always loyal friend. We will be there for you, and we will be there for you. (Applause.)So thank you for being here. I wish you a very, very happy St. Patricks Day. And God bless you and may God bless Ireland, and Northern Ireland, and may God bless America. Thank you very much. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you very much.TAOISEACH KENNY: Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, ladies and gentlemen. It's a great honor to be back again in the most famous house in the world to celebrate St. Patricks Day, the most special of days for Irish men and Irish women and those of Irish descent the world over.Since I had the privilege of being elected as Taoiseach in 2011, I've had the pleasure of being here in the White House each March to mark the enduring connections between our country and the United States. Fionnuala and I would like sincerely to thank President Trump for so graciously continuing this great tradition of hospitality which means so much to Irish people everywhere.I'm proud, sir, to have the opportunity to contribute to maintaining and developing relations between Ireland and the United States, particularly at the beginning of the new era in our countrys relationship following your election, Mr. President. Let me congratulate you and wish you and your administration the very best as you begin your term of office. (Applause.)This job, the job you hold, is exceptionally demanding and exceptionally difficult. The United States remains the most influential, as well as the most powerful country in the world. You hold the hopes and the future of America, and indeed, the world in your hands.But let me thank you for giving so much of your time today to this visit. We had an excellent meeting, a first-class meeting this morning in the Oval Office, not there very often, where we discussed a variety of important issues of mutual concern. And I want to assure you, sir, of our commitment to working closely with you and your administration as you face the many challenges up ahead.The ties that bind our two countries are deep and historic. And Ireland and the United States have a unique relationship that goes back to the earliest days of the original 14 colonies. Irish foreign military officers assisted George Washington to win that war of independence. Indeed, theyve fought in every war for America since then. And this very house was designed by James Hoban from Kilkenny, modeled in part after the Leinster House in Dublin, where the Irish parliament has met on our own independence since 1922.It's fitting that we gather here each year to celebrate St. Patrick and his legacy. He, too, of course, was an immigrant. And though he is, of course, the patron saint of Ireland, for many people around the globe, he is also a symbol of, indeed, the patron of immigrants.Here in America, your great country, 35 million people claim Irish heritage, and the Irish have contributed to the economic, social, political and cultural life of this great country over the last 200 years. Ireland came to America because, deprived of liberty, deprived of opportunity, of safety, of even food itself, the Irish believed, four decades before Lady Liberty lifted her lamp, we were the wretched refuse on the teeming shore. We believed in the shelter of America, and the compassion of America, and the opportunity of America. We came, and we became Americans.We lived the words of John F. Kennedy long before we heard them: We asked not what America could do for us, but what we could do for America. And we still do. We want to give, and not to take. We know the Irish have built the bridges and the roads, protected the public as firefighters and police officers. We've cared for the sick in hospitals, entertained as poets, as singers and writers, as politicians, as judges and legislators. And as entrepreneurs, they provided hundreds of thousands of jobs for Americans, including most recently, in exciting technology companies.Two-way trade in goods is approaching $100 billion a year at the moment. Irish firms employ 100,000 people across 50 states in the U.S. And we want to build on this for the future.Mr. President, as a small island on the edge of Europe, a natural bridge between the United States and Europe, and as a committed member of the European Union and a close friend of the United States, we will work hard with you, Mr. President, and with your administration in pursuit of strong and open relations between the United States and the European Union, including the strong trade relationships for the mutual benefit of millions of people either side of the Atlantic.I believe that the strong people-to-people links that Ireland and the United States have developed over the generations will help us in this endeavor. And I wish you and the American people every success and happiness in the future.To Irish-Americans coast to coast, I say, these days especially, we hold you in our hearts. And tonight, I thank you again for your warm hospitality.Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, may I wish you and your lovely families every good wish and blessing on this very special day. Indeed, I'm reminded in many ways of the dream of another American President -- which Ireland will work with you for -- when he spoke the words and said, My dream is of a place and a time where America will once again be seen as the last, best hope of Earth. Spoken by Abraham Lincoln.Mr. President, Ireland will help you build on that foundation to achieve the ultimate dream. Thank you, sir. And God bless you. (Applause.)END6:23 P.M.

EDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT: Well, good afternoon. On behalf of the President of the United States, today it will be my great privilege to administer the oath of office to Senator Dan Coats, who will become the fifth Director of National Intelligence for the United States of America. (Applause.)This is a singular privilege for me as I have known Senator Coats now for more than 30 years and couldnt be more grateful for his willingness to continue his service to the United States of America in this vitally important role in the life of our nation.Were joined this afternoon by his wife, Marsha, his son Andrew, his daughter Lisa. And we send greetings from afar to his daughter Laura, who is watching from Louisville, Kentucky, I know with great pride in her father and in her parents and their continuing service.Also very honored to be joined today by a member of the intelligence committee in the Senate, Senator James Lankford, and the newest member of the United States Senate, Senator Luther Strange. Thank you both for being here for this occasion. (Applause.)Senator Coats, you come here today after a long career in public service. In our home state of Indiana, you served with great distinction -- first answering the call to serve our country in uniform in the United States Army. You would be elected to the United States Congress in 1980, serving four terms in the House of Representatives, and then decade in the Senate, followed by four very distinguished years as the United States Ambassador to Germany.You arrived literally -- your second day on the job was September 11th, 2001. And in that moment of crisis for the United States and crisis in the world, you played a leading role in marshalling European support for our nation in that dark hour.Although you tried to retire from public service in 2005, you failed -- just as you have again. (Laughter.) And you ran for the United States Senate in 2010 and served another term, serving on the intelligence committee. You chaired the joint economic committee, adding to the more than a decade that you served on the armed services committee in the United States Senate.Throughout all of your years, you represented not only the state of Indiana well, but you represented the interests of the United States with extraordinary integrity and commitment.From one Hoosier to another, Im grateful and proud for your service to date. And I know that President Trump is grateful and proud of your willingness to serve our nation at such a time as this.The President has called you to serve this country as our Director of National Intelligence. As you know from your many conversations with him, President Trump has no higher goal than the safety and security of the American people, and from this day forward, as Director of National Intelligence, you will bring your background, your experience, your integrity, and the relationships that you have built around this nation and around the world in integrating and improving the best intelligence community in the world to be even better still.The President and I have absolute faith in you. Youve served our country with distinction for decades, and the President and I are confident that you will continue that record of leadership, integrity, and devotion to this country in the days ahead.And so, on behalf of President Trump, it is my great privilege to administer to you the oath of office.(The oath is administered.) (Applause.)THE VICE PRESIDENT: Ladies and gentlemen, the Director of National Intelligence for the United States, Dan Coats. (Applause.)DIRECTOR COATS: Mr. Vice President, thank you for a more than generous introduction. But more importantly thank you for the many years of friendship with you and Karen, for your service in the House of Representatives, on the leadership in that House, for being an outstanding governor for our cherished Hoosier state, and now being awarded the great privilege of being Vice President of the United States.To know you, to know who you are, to be so proud of our friendship, so proud of you in terms of your leadership, and being part of the team that's going to do everything we can to keep America safe, to keep America prosperous, to keep America being the America that serves all Americans, the kind of country that is recognized around the world. Im deeply grateful for your leadership with that.These are clearly uncertain times. Its so wonderful to be supported by a wife of many, many years who is -- and at my right-hand side -- counselor, supporter, a faithful companion; by our daughter Lisa; by our son Andrew; and our daughter Laura, who is in Louisville, Kentucky watching hopefully this procedure.These are clearly uncertain times, but I inherit an intelligence community made up of men and women who have dedicated their careers and their lives. Its a 24/7-365-day operation. And it is designed to protect Americans from threats from home and abroad. It is designed to be the best intelligence agency in the world. It is functioning well, but everyone that serves in that community say we can even do better. Its a great privilege to be able to be selected to lead that effort and to continue to be the best intelligence service in the world providing our President, Vice President, and policymakers with the needed information they need to inscribe safe policies, good policies, and lead our nation; and in fact, always lead the world as America has done since its founding.Mr. Vice President, I thank you.

353,2017-03-16,Remarks by President Trump and Taoiseach Enda Kenny of Ireland at Friends of Ireland Luncheon  ,"U.S. CapitolWashington, D.C.12:12 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Speaker Ryan, for that wonderful toast -- although Ive heard better jokes. (Laughter.) And thank you to all of our friends and distinguished members of Congress for joining us here today -- a great honor. And a really great honor to be with you, Vice President Pence. You have been terrific. (Applause.) And all of our friends welcoming Taoiseach. Thats my new friend; hes my new friend. Great guy. (Applause.) And, Fionnuala, you know, you are something very special. We sat, we talked, and I think were friends now too, right? And its really an honor. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause.) Thanks, Fionnuala. Appreciate it. Also, the delegation members -- very, very special. Spent some time together, and were going to have a very, very great long-term relationship, as we would with Ireland anyway. But this is a very special group, so I very much appreciate it. Were here today to celebrate Americas commitment to Ireland and the tremendous contributions -- and I know it well -- the Irish immigrants and their descendants have made right here in the United States and throughout the world. The very first St. Patrick's Day parade -- I spent a lot of time at St. Patricks Day parades over the years, I will tell you that - was held in my hometown, New York City, on March 17th, 1762. With each subsequent year, the Irish people marched, passed another accomplishment, and celebrated another very hard-earned success. And they have had tremendous success all over the world, but in this country they have had tremendous success.Over the years, they marched past the beautiful St. Patricks Cathedral, now an immortal monument to the faith of Irish Catholics in America. They celebrated their shared success in American society with the election of John F. Kennedy. (Applause.) They fought for America in war and combat. And their battlefield courage has earned admiration and acclaim throughout the world. They have great courage.The proud tradition that started in 1762 has flourished and is now celebrated by Americans of all faiths and backgrounds all across our very beautiful and very special land. As we stand together with our Irish friends, Im reminded of that proverb -- and this is a good one, this is one I like; Ive heard it for many, many years and I love it -- Always remember to forget the friends that proved untrue. But never forget to remember those that have stuck by you. We know that, politically speaking. A lot of us know that, we know it well. (Applause.) Its a great phrase.The people of Ireland and the people of the United States have stuck together through good times and bad times. Over many centuries we have built a bond that thrives, inspires and endures. And with us, its going to be closer than ever before, I can tell you that. (Applause.) So as we celebrate our shared history and our enduring friendship, let us commit ourselves to working together, as we will, to build on that bond for the benefit of our citizens for many more generations to come.Thank you. God bless you. And may God always bless our deep and lasting friendship and relationship. We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland. Thank you very much for being here. (Applause.) SPEAKER RYAN: Thank you so much, Mr. President. It is now my pleasure to introduce An Taoiseach, our friend, Enda Kenny. (Applause.) TAOISEACH KENNY: Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, members ofCongress, ambassadors, friends of Ireland, distinguished guests. (Speaks in Irish.) I didnt say anything disparaging about you there. (Laughter.) What I said was, it's a pleasure for me to be here, along with my wife, Fionnuala, to be amongst this august gathering. And on behalf of the government of Ireland and the people of Ireland, I wish you all a very happy St. Patrick's festival for you all. They say the Irish have the capacity to change everything. I just saw the President of the United States read from his script, entirely. (Laughter and applause.) I was going to say ""a change is coming."" (Laughter.) Paul, it's a pleasure. And thank you for your visit to Ireland when you called to see me in government buildings with your family and on your visit down to Kilkenny. When I had the privilege of speaking to the President on the telephone very shortly after his election, I said to him if it would be possible to continue this tradition, which began so many years ago, and he said, without hesitation, of course -- followed by the Vice President and U.S. Speaker. This is a unique occasion for Ireland and for its people. To have the facility of being honored by the Speaker of the House, the access to the President of the United States, the Vice President, and most of the team is something that we really do cherish. It goes back a very long way from when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan and all of the others put this together in the first place. So it's a really important day for us, and we're very grateful to stand between these two flags, united in history and so much.I havent had the opportunity to present you with a particular piece of sculpture which is entitled ""Arrival,"" by John Behan. It's a miniature -- but it's quite large -- of what stands at the United Nations in New York of the tale and the story and the history of Irish immigrants after the famine years. So let me congratulate you, President Trump, on your election. You beat them all. (Laughter and applause.) Whatever they say, elections are tough-going. I know, I've been through 20 of them myself. (Laughter.) But the President and the Vice President and this administration now holds within its hands the responsibility of dealing with so many global international issues in a world that is changing so rapidly and that is so fragile in so many respects. And I know that you will do your utmost to work in the interests of our common humanity, and you will have the prayers and the support of the Irish people. And let me say to you, and the European Union -- and the work that you have to do in the times -- in the challenging times ahead.We discussed the kind of driver that the President uses -- Titleist, 9-degree loft, Doonbeg, wind off the Atlantic. You have to roll the wrist at the top to get that shot straight. And during the course of this presidency, President Trump will visit Ireland, and he said he would put the sticks in the hold of Air Force One. Anyway, let me just say a few words here about our country. We've come through a torrid time a number of years ago. When I took over the government back in 2011, we were blocked out of all the markets, the Troika were in town, our sovereignty was gone, our hope was gone; hemorrhage of immigration, and a falloff in all business right across every sector. Now, because of the sacrifices of the people and tough choices made, we're in a different spot. Unemployment, which was 15.2, is now down to 6.6 percent and falling. Employment is the highest in 10 years. A growth rate of 5.2 percent last year. Fourth year running. Ireland is the fastest-growing country in Europe. Deficit eliminated next year. Two million-plus working now. I was accused in Cork three weeks ago of blocking up the Irish roads with people going to work. (Laughter and applause.) That's the challenge of success, I suppose. It's fair to say, as you know, Mr. President, we've got 700 Irish firms, and 65 percent of the 700 firms working in America have a full-time presence in this market. And they now employ 100,000 people across 50 states. And that's because of our participation in the European Union and the confidence that our people have to expand now beyond their own shores. And this two-way conduit is to the mutual benefit of our people and of the United States. And let me say that Ireland and the European Union will never be anything but a friend to your country, to these United States here. (Applause.) And I want you to understand that all administrations, over the last 40 years and beyond, have worked in the interests of the fragility of our country. We've had our troubles. We've had real difficulties. And George Mitchell spoke last night at the Ireland Funds about the contribution that both Europe, and particularly the United States, made towards putting that fragile peace together. We're glad to see Ian Paisley here and, indeed, Gerry Adams, who have had their difficulties. We have put it all together and have maintained a fragile peace. And that's why it's important that we recognize the contribution made by the United States to that peace, where we have no border and where people can live their lives as one would expect to contribute to their country and their economies. And all presidents and all administrations over the years have assisted us in that regard. (Applause.) So we want to protect this peace process, and I know that youre going to work with us in that context also. We have agreed with the British government that there would be no return to the border, as it used to apply years ago, with customs, posts on major roads, and every other road blown up or impassable because of sectarian violence that that brought with it. We have banished that. We want to see it remain banished. And the political agreement is no return to that kind of border of the past, and the challenge is to implement that in a way that works in the interests of the people North and South. And let me say to you that as a member of the European Council, what we want to do is to work with America. I believe genuinely, with Europe having created 4.5 million jobs in the last three years, that we can work with the United States to create more employment here, create opportunities for so many millions of Americans. And it may well be that in a revised trade agenda, that we can do that to the mutual benefit of 500 million people in the European Union and your population here across the United States. We will work with this administration, Paul and Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, in the interests of everybody. Thank you, Peter King, and thank you, Richard Neal -- I know youre here somewhere -- for the work youve done over the years with the (inaudible). (Applause.) It may well be that it might be appropriate for the government and the administration to have a desk here in Washington which will associate itself with Northern Ireland, so that in the event of contact having to be made, that theres a voice to answer that. You had in the past envoys appointed to Northern Ireland on practically a full-time basis. I think we can work now as a priority to get this executive up and running in the next short period. But to have continued connection here with the administration would be very important, and Im sure Peter and Rich will work at that.I just want to say, I had a very good meeting this morning with the Vice President and with General John Kelly. Sitting at the table, we were hosted by the Vice President in the traditional breakfast in the Naval Observatory. Didnt get much chance to eat the breakfast, I have to say; its one of the difficulties in politics -- its in front of you but you cant get near it. (Laughter.) We did discuss the question of immigration, which is so important to the fabric of our people. And I know that in this country, this is an issue that the administration and the President are reflecting upon. And thats something that, again, we will work with you diligently in this regard in the two sectors that we used to have a facility for E3 visas for young people who want to come to America and to work here. We discussed that very constructively this morning.And secondly, as a part of the overall immigration reform that the Irish have contributed so much, it would be part of that. And we look forward to the works that will take place at the time ahead. You might say that when Mike Pences grandfather landed here in Ellis Island in 1923, that the contribution had been made by so many Irish for so many years. It was in 1771 that the friendly Sons of St. Patrick were put together in Philadelphia, and one of their first honorary members was a young man called George Washington. And seven years later, he handed the first commission to a naval officer called John Barry, who was co-founder of the American Navy. And he was joined later by John Holland, who designed the first submarine. And he was followed by Louis Brennan, from my hometown, who had a major impact on the navigation systems for torpedoes. And so many others, from Henry Ford, through music and culture, and so many other areas, that 22 members of the American Presidents who sat in the White House had either Scots or Irish blood in them. And you follow in that line, sir. And Id just like to say in finality, this is what I said to your predecessor on a number of occasions: We would like this to be sorted. It would remove a burden of so many people that they can stand out in the light and say, now I am free to contribute to America as I know I can. And thats what people want. (Applause.) I know youll reflect on this, but Im always struck by the American National Anthem when its sung before the great occasions. And I suppose being an emotional Irishman, the hairs tingle at the back of your neck when you hear your own national anthem. But for us, when Old Glory waves, and you put your hand on your heart and you say, The land of the free and the home of the brave, ours is still as brave as ever, but maybe not as free. Because of the 4,000 Congressional Medals of Honor given out to the defense forces, over 2,000 go to the Irish Americans. So they fought in the Revolutionary War. They beat the daylights out of each other in Fredericksburg and Gettysburg and Yorktown, and other places, in Atlanta. They fought every war for America and died for America -- and will continue to do so. All they want is the opportunity to be free.And this administration, working with Democrats and Republicans, I hope, can sort this out once and for all. And for future years, you determine what it is that you want to do. As George Mitchell said last evening, you cant return to open immigration, but for the people who are here -- who should be here, might be here -- thats an issue that Im sure your administration will reflect on. And we in Ireland will give you every assistance in that regard.There are millions out there who want to play their part for America -- if you like, who want to make America great. (Laughter.) Heard it before? Heard that before? (Applause.) So I see Vicki here in front of me. We didnt get as far as the Kennedy Center the other evening. I was talking to young people the other day, they were on about all the different things that are happening in the world, and they reminded me of one of JFKs statements: This is our planet. Together, we shall save or we shall perish in its flames. We have work to do. Lets eat. Thank you. (Applause.) END12:31 P.M.

354,2017-03-16,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 3/16/2017, #25","James S. Brady Briefing Room3:04 P.M. EDTMR. SPICER: Sorry for the delay, guys. It's budget day. I was supposed to kick this off with Director Mulvaney. He's still on a call with the governors, and continues to host a ton of briefings today with key stakeholders. And so my goal, if this times out right, is that as we finish up, Director Mulvaney will walk in the room, right on cue, and then he will talk to you a little bit about the budget, and we'll walk through Q&A on that. So hopefully this all works.I'm going to skip past the part where I say ""thank you, Director Mulvaney."" (Laughter.) As the Director will say, the Presidents budget blueprint keeps his promise to put America's security first, turning his words directly into policies that restore respect for our citizens hard-earned tax dollars.There were some additional non-events -- non-budget events of the day. This morning, the President had a bilateral meeting with Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland. Our two nations have a long history, common values, and important economic ties.The President was honored to host him here in the Oval Office and recommit to strong social, political, and economic relations between the U.S. and Ireland.This afternoon, the President made the remarks at the Friends of Ireland Luncheon at the Capitol. This traditional lunch celebrating Americas bipartisan commitment to peace and security in Ireland was started in 1983 by President Reagan and Speaker ONeill -- both proud Irish Americans -- and has been attended by every President, Speaker, and Taoiseach of Ireland since then.And also, while at the Capitol this afternoon, right around now, the Vice President is swearing in former Senator Dan Coats as the next Director of National Intelligence in his ceremonial office. Former Senator Coats has clearly demonstrated the deep subject -- the subject matter expertise and sound judgment required to lead our intelligence community, and the President is finally glad have him on board as part of him team.Later this evening, the President, along with Taoiseach Kenny, will attend the St. Patricks Day Reception and participate in the annual Shamrock Ceremony. Since 1952, the President has invited the Taoiseach to come to the White House in celebration of St. Patricks Day, where they present a bowl of shamrocks as a symbol of the profound and lasting relationship between the two countries. The President and Taoiseach Kenny will also make remarks.I have a few more notes before I get to Director Mulvaney. First, I wanted to share with you guys -- it's a letter that should be going out shortly, if it hasnt already, that the President signed this morning, wishing Ray Chavez, the oldest living survivor of Pearl Harbor, a happy 105th birthday.Our nation owes Mr. Chavezs generation -- a Great Generation -- a debt of gratitude for an extraordinary legacy of liberty and freedom around the world, fighting to ensure security and prosperity for millions. A copy of the letter will be sent out, if it hasnt already. And obviously, we all extend our warm wishes to Ray and his family and they celebrate his 105th. And the President signed the letter wishing that he hopes to have several more birthdays to come.This afternoon, the President announced his intent to nominate several individuals to key posts at the Department of Defense: Robert Daigle as Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation; Elaine McCusker as Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense; David Norquist as Under Secretary of Defense and Comptroller; Kenneth Rapuano as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security; Patrick Shanahan as Deputy Secretary of Defense; and David Joel Trachtenberg as Principal Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy.The President is glad to have these extremely qualified men and women on board to assist Secretary Mattis as he undertakes the great rebuilding of our nations military.Also this afternoon, the President declared a major disaster in the State of California and ordered federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe winter storms, flooding, and mudslides this January.We also announced this afternoon that Second Lady Karen Pence will lead the Presidential Delegation to the 2017 Special Olympics World Winter Games in Austria.The House Budget Committee met earlier this morning and approved the American Health Care Act, making it now the third committee to move the AHCA forward. Were working hand in glove with the House to consider improvements, and were confident that this thoughtful and thorough process will lead to legislation that reforms our healthcare, making it affordable and accessible to every American.Since we wont have a chance to meet tomorrow in light of the President and Chancellor Merkel's press conference, I wanted to quickly walk you through a couple of events on the President's schedule.Tomorrow, of course, the President will welcome German Chancellor Merkel here to the White House, a rescheduling from the snow, inclement weather that prevented that from happening the other day. The President and the Chancellor will have a series of meetings and then will host a roundtable focusing on the importance of vocational training with both American and German business leaders.They will also have a press conference in the afternoon. Well have details on the entire day later this afternoon.Also tomorrow, the President will attend a listening session with Veterans Affairs and VA Secretary Shulkin and representatives from the various Veterans Service Organizations.It's incredibly important to the President that we reform the VA system so that it can fulfill the promises made to the men and women who risked their lives for our nation. He looks forward to discussing potential changes that can help improve the Veterans Administration.On Monday, the President will meet with Bill Gates, the cofounder of Microsoft. He'll also have lunch with the Vice President and a meeting with the Secretary of State.Later that afternoon, the President will welcome Prime Minister Abadi of Iraq to the White House.And on Wednesday, the President has invited all 49 members of the Congressional Black Caucus to come to the White House for a meeting. The President looks forward to welcoming [them] for what he hopes will be a productive discussion.And I also want to remind everyone that -- I did yesterday, via Twitter -- that the lottery for the 139th Annual White House Easter Egg Roll is open until Saturday -- this coming Saturday. Everyone who is interested in attending can go to Recreation.gov. Further information is at WhiteHouse.gov for details.At his rally last night, the President addressed the decision by the federal district court in Hawaii to block his lawful executive order. As the President said last night, The law and the Constitution give the President the power to suspend immigration when he deems it to be necessary in the national interest... The Court didn't even bother to quote the relevant statute in its opinion, which could have plainly shown that the President clearly has this authority.I know youve heard it before, but since the Court didnt, let me quote it again for you. 8 U.S. Code 1182 states: Whenever the President finds [that] the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he [shall] deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem [to be] appropriate.The Department of Justice said in a statement that they strongly disagree[s] with the federal district courts ruling, which is flawed both in reasoning and [in] scope. DOJ continued, The Presidents executive order falls squarely within his lawful authority in seeking to protect our nations security, and the Department will continue to defend this executive order in the courts.The Department is exploring all available options to vigorously defend this executive order. We intend to appeal the flawed rulings. Currently, the Department of Justice is determining the legal strategy and timing. We expect action to be taken soon to appeal the ruling in the 4th Circuit and to seek clarification of the order prior to appeal in the 9th Circuit.The danger is real, and the law is clear. The President was elected to change our broken immigration system, and he will continue to exercise his constitutional authority and presidential responsibility to protect our nation.And just before I get to your questions, and then before well introduce Director Mulvaney, I just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions that have come up recently.Jon Decker asked multiple times on the enforcement of the Presidents executive order to restrict lobbying activities of executive branch employees, which includes a five-year ban on lobbying agencies where you've served and a lifetime ban on lobbying from foreign governments. I said Id get back to Jon, so here we go. The executive order itself has a section, Section 5, which focuses on enforcement. The order outlines that each agency head is tasked with working with the Office of Government Ethics to establish procedures for determining potential violations of the ethics pledge. Should a violation be determined, the executive order authorizes the Department of Justice to enforce the order through several mechanisms: debarment proceedings -- these would restrict an individual or his or her associated entities from doing business with the federal government; seeking an injunction, such as a restraining order from lobbying for 10 years -- the five years in the ethics agreement plus an additional five years; or civil penalties such as a fine commensurate with the nature of the violation.The President fully expects the Department of Justice to vigorously enforce this executive order.Also yesterday several of you asked where the House is in regard to additional legislation as outlined in the third prong of the AHCA and the Presidents plan to reform healthcare. Im pleased to note that last night Leader McCarthy in the House introduced four pieces of legislation that will remove burdensome regulations, lower costs, and increase access as we've noted: the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, H.R. 372, which eliminates anti-trust protection for an insurance provider, creating competition so that Americans are not left with just one choice for healthcare coverage; the Small Business Health Fairness Act, H.R. 1101, which allows small businesses to band together and negotiate lower prices; the Protecting Access to Care Act, H.R. 1215, which limits frivolous lawsuits that unnecessarily drive up healthcare costs; and the Self-Insurance Protection Act, H.R. 1304, which protects workers who get their healthcare coverage from employers that self-insure by providing a backstop on catastrophic losses. And finally, in terms of following up from yesterday, in regard to the DOJs indictments of Russian hackers on Yahoo data, this action demonstrates the United States commitment to identifying cyber criminals and bringing them to justice, no matter where they are. It also highlights the criminal importance of international cooperation to our cyber regime. And like I said, yesterday, though this is a lawful enforcement action, anything beyond that, I would direct you to the Department of Justice and the FBI for further details.Before I continue, let me turn it over to Director Mulvaney to talk a little bit about the budget.Director?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Thanks very much. Good afternoon, and happy day before St. Patricks Day, also known as Budget Day. Most of you heard me talk about the budget before so Im not going to say too many things in opening before we get to your questions. But we will remind you that this is what we're calling the America First Budget. We had an America First candidate; you now have an America First President. And it shouldnt surprise anybody that we have an America First Budget. Its in the details, as we talked about last week -- $54 billion of additional defense spending. We have some more details today on where that money is going.We're seeing increases at the VA, increases within the Department of Justice for law enforcement, increases within the Department of Homeland Security for things that include border security and immigration controls. Immigration is within -- excuse me -- increases within the Department of Energy to deal with a nuclear triad.And then corresponding reductions in similar amounts offsetting dollar for dollar in other programs. The largest reduction if you've seen the budget already is a 31 percent reduction within the Environmental Protection Agency. The next largest reduction on a percentage basis is within Department of State; and the other departments are reduced in lesser amounts. I think the smallest reduction we have is NASA, which is just less than 1 percent. But there again, as with many of the agencies, youll see certain line items within those budgets plussed up.This is the message the President wanted to send to the public, to the press, to Capitol Hill: he wants more money for defense; more money for border enforcement; more money for law enforcement generally; more money for the vets; more money for school choice. And then to offset that money with savings elsewhere so that all of that is done without an additional dollar added to the deficit.As Ive mentioned before, the budget does not balance the budget. This budget simply reallocates and reprioritizes spending as any family or business would do.This budget does not -- for those of you who were not here last week -- this budget does not address the big-picture items such as policy changes, revenue flows, tax policy, mandatory spending. This is simply the topline spending budget. That's why we call it the budget blueprint, and not the full budget. That full budget, which will contain all the rest of those pieces and parts, will be released in May.Before I take questions, Im going to do something I dont ordinarily do -- Im sure its kind of new -- Im going to call on the New York Times because theyre in trouble. Apparently, is there a -- wheres my New York Times guy? Matt Flegenheimer and Alan Rappeport -- okay, are in big trouble. Ill give you the first question but you have to deliver this message to them. They printed this morning that I am the father of 17-year-old triplet girls. My 17-year-old daughter really wishes that were happy -- really wishes that had happened, but my two 17-year-old sons are upset. (Laughter.) So if you could clarify that, that would be great. And Ill give you the first questions, if youve got one. So go ahead.Q  Were not great at math, obviously, at the New York Times. DIRECTOR MULVANEY: The math is right, its actually the gender that was wrong. (Laughter.) Q  Sir, during the campaign President Trump, then candidate Trump, talked about the national debt, which of course has reached around $20 trillion. You mentioned it in your budget message this morning. Is there a plan, as the President talked about during last years campaign, to actually eliminate the national debt in eight years? He said during the campaign it would be easy to actually eliminate the entire debt -- not the deficit, but the debt -- in eight years. Is that something that this President is actually committed to trying to do?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Its a good question, its a fair question. I would just suggest to you its not the right time for the question. The budget blueprint, again, does not deal with the debt, it even doesnt deal with the deficit. It is simply the first part of the appropriations process. Well send this up to the Hill now, and the Appropriations Committees of the House and the Senate -- of course the House controls the power of the purse, the Senate -- excuse me, Congress controls the power of the purse. And this will be the first step in that process.We will start to address the issues of the longer-term deficit, longer-term debt in that larger budget. And of course well have to deal at that time with things like mandatory spending, tax policy, revenue flows to the government. So again, its a fair question, I just dont think now is the time to ask the question. Q  The 28 percent that comes out of the State Department, I know that youre leaving a lot of discretion to the people who are in charge there at all of these agencies for how to implement these cuts. But how much is intended to come out of the foreign aid budget of that $10 billion?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: A lot of it. As Ive said before, one of the reasons that youre seeing such a dramatic reduction in the State Department on a percentage basis is not that this President thinks that diplomacy is not important -- in fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Weve already seen that Secretary Tillerson has had a tremendous -- one diplomatic success already on the deal he cut with Iraq.The President believes in diplomacy, and we believe that this budget protects that core function of the State Department. It just so happens that much of the foreign aid that the President talked about in campaign -- much of the money that goes to climate research, green energy, those types of things -- are actually in the State Department budget. If those line items had been in the Department of Commerce, you would see Department of Commerce having gone down by a similarly large percentage.So the answer to your question is that most of the cuts within the State Department try to focus directly on foreign aid. Yes, sir.Q  Yes, the budget showed a 0.8 decrease for NASA, but youve also talked about in the administration using private companies such as SpaceX, for example, for more of that. So does this show some -- is some of this going to be shifted over to the private sector? And does this show a commitment on the administrations part towards science and NASA?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: It does. Again, if you go back and you do what we did, which is go back to the Presidents speeches, the interviews he gave and just talking to him, we tried to identify his priorities. And one of the things he told us was, look, Im still interested in America being involved in space exploration.So even though the overall topline number at NASA is reduced by a small fraction -- I think its 0.8 percent, as you mentioned -- individual line items that deal with specifically space exploration are actually plussed up. And part of the intent there is to promote exactly what you just talked about.Yes, sir.Q  Two questions. Your own experience in the House tells you that a lot of these cuts havent been voted for before. Do you consider this budget an opening bid, and do you expect a lot of pushback, even from Republicans, on the specificity and the size of these cuts? And secondly, to take your point about the Presidents words on the campaign, those of us who traveled around with him remember -- he said he didnt want to touch Social Security, Medicare, the big entitlements. The fact that thats not in this budget, is that a signal that those programs are going to remain untouched? And as the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said, that ignores 70 percent of spending and 90 percent of its growth over the next decade.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Ill deal with the second one first, which is the President is absolutely going to keep the promises he kept on the campaign trail. Again, you will see no reference in Social Security here, no reference to Medicare here, no reference to Medicaid here or any of the other mandatory programs -- what some people call entitlement programs -- because thats not what this budget is.This is the discretionary part of the budget, half of which, as you know, is defense, and the other half is everything else, the alphabet soup of government. So just because its not here doesnt mean were dodging the issue. You would never see in any budget blueprint that deals with the topline spending numbers Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.To your other question about it not being popular on the Hill -- yeah, I can recognize that. Ive been on the Hill enough to know that some of these would be very unpopular. Keep in mind the President is in a unique position. Ive been a member of Congress, I represented 700,000 people in South Carolina. I had my constituency. It was a district. Senators represent an entire state. Were always dealing with special interests from back home, were dealing with lobbyists from back home.The President is beholden to none of that. The President has drafted a budget for the entire nation because thats who he sees himself as representing. He did not ask lobbyists for input on this, he did not ask special interests for input on this, and he certainly didnt focus on how these programs might impact a specific congressional district.But we knew that going into it. And again, the message were sending to the Hill is we want more money for the things the President talked about, defense being the top one, national security, and we dont want to add to the budget deficit. If Congress has another way to do that were happy to talk to them about it.Yes, sir, in the glasses.Q  James Bays from Al Jazeera. The United Nations said the world is currently facing the largest humanitarian crisis since the end of World War II -- 20 million people in just four countries facing starvation or famine. And yet you're cutting funding to the U.N., cutting funding to the foreign aid budget. Are you worried that some of the most vulnerable people on Earth will suffer as a result?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: We're absolutely reducing funding to the U.N. and to the various foreign aid programs, including those run by the U.N. and other agencies. That should come as a surprise to no one who watched the campaign. The President said specifically hundreds of time -- you covered him -- I'm going to spend less money on people overseas and more money on people back home. And that's exactly what we're doing with this budget.Yes, maam.Q  Given your focus on dollar-for-dollar offsets in fiscal 18, and for your fiscal 2017 request you didnt insist on dollar-for-dollar offsets. Why is that? Why are you not concerned about adding to the deficit in fiscal 2017?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: The large part of the -- the point -- the question deals with the 2017 request, which is a $30 billion -- I think it's actually $3 billion -- a billion and a half in there for the wall. And it's not entirely offset. Theres a couple reasons for that. One of them is time. Another one is that some of that is what they call Overseas Contingency Operations. Now, you also know that I have a somewhat colored history with the overseas contingency operation, but I will tell you that we went through this and made sure that the money that's being requested is true OCO -- means that it's focused truly on the areas where we're involved overseas, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, those types of places.So we have sent them $18 billion worth of proposed reductions for 2017, but not all of them are offset.Yes, maam.Q  The President has called for eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcast and the National Endowment for the Arts. If the Republican Congress sent the President appropriate bills that fund CPB and NEA, will he veto those bills and tell the Republican leadership to send bill that defunds those things?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: The message the President sent right now is that we want to defund those. And theres completely defensible reasons for doing that. It's a simple message, by the way. I put myself in the shoes of that steelworker in Ohio, the coal-mining family in West Virginia, the mother of two in Detroit, and I'm saying, okay, I have to go ask these folks for money and I have to tell them where I'm going to spend it. Can I really go to those folks, look them in the eye and say, look, I want to take money from you and I want to give it to the Corporation of Public Broadcasting? That is a really hard sell, in fact, some of you don't think we can defend anymore.As to specific vetoes, you and I both know it doesnt come over one by one, line item by line item doesnt come over. They come over in large appropriations bills. And we'll work with Congress to go through the appropriations process and we'll make determinations on whether or not to sign appropriations bills or veto them at the appropriate time.Yes, sir.Q  There are several cases in the country where you're talking about eliminating some of these unauthorized programs. Are you laying down a marker there on unauthorized programs, and do you think spending discipline would be improved if Congress authorized everything that it is --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: We hope so. For those of you who aren't familiar with this, we actually spend a lot of money in the federal government that's on programs that aren't authorized at all. Remember, spending is sort -- to break it down, it's sort of a three-step process to spend money. You have to budget for it first. Then you have to authorize it, and then you have to appropriate it. But a lot of the programs that we've spent money on for years have been unauthorized spending. Either they used to be authorized -- actually, most of them used to be authorized and then they simply lapsed. And some of them were just never authorized in the first place. They simply were appropriated without any authorization.And, yeah, the message is that's not the right way to do it. In fact, we think that's the wrong way to do it. You heard the President talk specifically on the campaign trail about at least 5 percent reductions for unauthorized programs, and that's what generated this budget.Q  Director Mulvaney talked about this budget basically keeping the promises that the President made during the course of the campaign. For Housing and Urban Development, this budget blueprint calls for a 13-percent reduction, $6 billion. During the course of the campaign, President Trump said, specifically to urban black voters, he says, What do you have to lose? It turns out what they have to lose is at least $6 billion that goes to many programs that benefit those communities. What do you say to those Americans who feel that?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Nobody is going to get kicked out of their houses. What we did when we looked at the HUD budget was try to figure out a way to spend money better, and what we saw -- and I talked to Dr. Carson about this just today -- what we saw as we went through the analysis of the HUD budget is that a lot of their money got spent on government housing and building. It's actually infrastructure. And what Senator Carson -- what Secretary Carson and I talked about was figure out a way to do that better. And as we did that, what we realized was we are working on a large infrastructure program that we hope to roll out this summer. And what Secretary Carson wants to do is take the money for the infrastructure that's in HUD right now -- and not very well run -- and move that into this larger program.In fact, youll see the same line items -- or similar line items at the Department of Transportation for the same reason. These do not mean the President is changing his commitment to infrastructure. Again, far from it. What we're saying is, look, for years and years we have built infrastructure like this and it doesnt work very well --Q  Well --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Let me finish and I'll get back to you. So what we're doing now is we're taking it out of the discretionary budget and we're going to move it into the larger infrastructure plan this summer.Q  Housing and Urban Development and the Community Development Block Grants aren't exclusively about housing. They support a variety of different programs, including, in part, Meals on Wheels, that affects a lot of Americans. In Austin, Texas today, one organization there that delivers those meals to thousands of elderly says that those citizens will no longer be able to be provided those meals. So what do you say to those Americans who are ultimately losing out? Not on housing, but on other things that are taken out of that budget?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: As you know, or I think you know that Meals on Wheels is not a federal program. It's part of that community -- the CDBG -- the block grants that we give to the states. And then many states make the decision to use that money on Meals on Wheels.Heres what I can tell you about CDBGs because that's what we fund -- right? -- is that we spend $150 billion on those programs since the 1970s. The CDBGs have been identified as programs since I believe the first -- actually, the second Bush administration as ones that were just not showing any results. We can't do that anymore. We can't spend money on programs just because they sound good. And Meals on Wheels sounds great -- again, that's a state decision to fund that particular portion to. But to take the federal money and give it to the states and say, look, we want to give you money for programs that don't work -- I can't defend that anymore. We cannot defend that anymore. We're $20 trillion in debt.We're going to spend money, we're going to spend a lot of money, but we're not going to spend it on programs that cannot show that they actually deliver the promises that we've made to people.Q  So you're talking about programs that do work or don't work. Theres a program called the SHINE, and it's in Pennsylvania -- rural counties of Pennsylvania that provides after-school educational programs for individuals in those areas, which so happens to be the state that helped propel President Trump to the White House. I'm curious to what you say to those Americans in the community where they tell me today that 800 individuals will no longer -- children, who need it most -- will no longer be provided, in those most-needed communities, that educational care they need.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: I'm not familiar -- you all are at an advantage over me because Id have to memorize all 4,000 line items. So lets talk about after-school programs, generally. Theyre supposed to be educational programs, right? That's what theyre supposed to do. Theyre supposed to help kids who don't get fed at home get fed so they do better in school. Guess what? Theres no demonstrable evidence theyre actually doing that. Theres no demonstrable evidence of actually helping results, helping kids do better in school, which is what -- when we took your money from you to say, look, we're going to go spend it on an after-school program. The way we justified it was these programs are going to help these kids do better in school and get better jobs. And we can't --Q  To be clear, we're saying that --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: -- prove that that's happening.Q  To be clear, we're saying -- the administration, with this budget, is saying that no after-school programs out there are doing their job in helping educate these children?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, but I -- and again, now you're asking me a question I don't know the answer to, but I don't believe we cut all the funding for those types of things. Yes, sir.Q  Just to follow up on that, you were talking about the steelworker in Ohio and the coalminer in Pennsylvania and so on. But those workers may have an elderly mother who depends on the Meals on Wheels program, who may have kids in Head Start. And yesterday or the day before, you described this as a hard-power budget, but is it also a hard-hearted measure?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, I don't think so. In fact, I think it's probably one of the most compassionate things we can do to actually be --Q  Cut programs that help the elderly and kids?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: You're only focusing on half of the equation, right? You're focusing on recipients of the money. We're trying to focus on both the recipients of the money and the folks who give us the money in the first place. And I think it's fairly compassionate to go to them and say, look, we're not going to ask you for your hard-earned money anymore. A single mom of two in Detroit, okay -- ""give us your money"" -- we're not going to do that anymore unless we can guarantee --Q  And that single mom has two kids -- what if that single mom has two kids in Head Start?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Let me finish. Unless we can guarantee to you that that money is actually being used in a proper function. And I think that is about as compassionate as you can get. Yes, maam.Q  I have a question on the border wall.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure.Q  Thank you for doing this. The budget, as I understand it, asked for $4.1 billion, so $1.5 [billion] for this year and $2.6 [billion] for the following year. Theres no mention at all of whether or not Mexico is going to help pay for it or reimburse the U.S. for it, as the President pledged. So where is that money coming from for the border wall?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: A couple of things. Your number is correct -- it's $1.5 [billion] for 2017 -- back to your question about 2017 -- and I think $2.6 [billion] for 2018. People have asked me a couple times, does that build the whole wall. No, it doesnt, but it gets us a start on the program and you'll see some of the wall being built this year, and then obviously increased funding in 2018. But the wall will take longer than two years to build. As to the source of funds, that's up to the President and the Treasury and the State Department. I'm the folks -- we're the guys at OMB and the gals at OMB who take the money that we have and allocate it in a budgetary process. So it's up to somebody else to figure out where the money comes from.Yes, sir.Q  Yes. The budget for DOJ zeroes out reimbursements for state and local jails holding immigrants in the country illegally. Some of that money now goes to sanctuary cities. Is that part of the Presidents promise to withhold funding from sanctuary cities? And are there other elements of the budget intended to carry out that punishment that the President talked about?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Honestly, I'm not familiar with that particular line item, so let me deal with the DOJ like this -- and also Homeland, because theres many pieces in Homeland that deal with this sort of topic. You're going to see an increase in Homeland for an increase in detention facilities. It's a fairly significant increase in detention facilities because we have -- the President has said he wants to stop the catch-and-release program. In fact, he signed an executive order to do just that. And we fund that; we increase the amount of money for detention facilities for folks who come into the country illegally. I'll give you a follow-up because I didnt answer your first question very well.Q  A question about the cuts you're making to things like transportation and housing. You said those would be paid for later with other appropriations, but you said this would be balanced. And I know you've been a fiscal hawk yourself. It sounds like a bit of a shell game, though, where you're saying now this is a balanced budget, but you're saying you're not stopping to pay for other things because those will be paid for later. But then where are you going to pay for those other things? Eventually, doesnt all this stuff have to get paid for?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: And just to clarify, it's not a balanced budget. There will still be roughly a $488 billion deficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office, next year. We simply didnt add to that in order to spend more money on the President's priorities. Regarding moving projects out of the, say, the base budgets for the agencies and into the infrastructure, the infrastructure program is something we've just recently started. It won't probably come until summer or maybe even early fall. We have to do Obamacare repeal and replace first, then tax reform second. That leaves infrastructure probably third, which may come after the August recess in Congress. So you're making an assumption that I'm not willing to make. You're making an assumption that all that infrastructure that we provide for later on in the year is going to go to the deficit, and I'm not willing to make that assumption.Yes, sir.Q  I have two short questions. One, the budget blueprint provides robust funding for embassy security --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, sir.Q  -- citing the Benghazi Accountability Review Board. Does that mean there will be an increase, considering all the criticism that the President and Republicans levied against President Obama for supposedly cutting embassy security?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: That's one of those line items that we leave up to Secretary Tillerson. He and I talked about the State Department budget and how he decides to allocate that. It may be that there are some embassies that dont need a lot more security and some that do. So we give him the flexibility to do that.The gentleman in the back had a question.Q  Many countries around the world didnt take seriously President Trump that he would cut the foreign aid, because most of the countries getting U.S. aid were not with the U.S. supporting terrorism against the U.S., and also they were not working with the U.S. So how does President Trump feel now about those countries? Will they continue the aid? Because U.S. taxpayers will be asking that we dont have to spend on those countries who are against the U.S.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Again, I come back to what the President said on the campaign, which is that he's going to spend less money overseas.To your question, though -- because this came up the other day -- which is the hard power versus soft power. There is a very deliberate attempt here to send a message to our allies and our friends, such as India, and our adversaries with other countries, shall we say, which is that this is hard-power budget, that this administration tends to change course from a soft-power budget to a hard-power budget, and that's a message that our adversaries and our allies alike should take.I'll take one more, because I'm sort of running down. Yes, ma'am.Q  Can you explain a little bit more about what message the President is trying to send by eliminating a lot of funding for science and climate change research, as you mentioned earlier? And just a follow-up later when you get a chance.DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Sure. A couple different messages. When we talked about science and climate change, let's deal with them separately. On science, we're going to function -- we're going to focus on the core function. There's reductions, for example, I think, in the NIH -- the National Institutes of Health. Why? Because we think there's been mission creep, we think they do things that are outside their core functions. We think there's tremendous opportunity for savings. We recommend, for example, that a couple of facilities be combined; there would be cost savings from that. Again, this comes back to the President's business person view of government, which is if you took over this as a CEO, and youd look at this on a spreadsheet and go, why do we have all of these facilities -- why do we have seven when we can do the same job with three, won't that save money? And the answer is, yes. So part of your answer is focusing on efficiencies and focusing on doing what we do better.Regarding the question as to climate change, I think the President was fairly straightforward -- we're not spending money on that anymore; we consider that to be a waste of your money to go out and do that. So that is a specific tie to his campaign.Q  A follow-up --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yes, I'm sorry, you had a follow-up.Q  Just really quick on Meals on Wheels. You mentioned that it's one of those programs that's determined had not been doing its job effectively. What evidence are you using to make that statement? And is not feeding seniors in and of itself the fulfillment of the --DIRECTOR MULVANEY: And my understanding from having been in the state government -- and I may have this wrong; I've been wrong several times today -- this may not be the first time. But my understanding of Meals on Wheels is that that is a state determination. The federal government doesnt directly fund that; it funds the central Community Development Block Grants, the CDBGs. And some states choose to take the money and do Meals and Wheels. Other states and localities might choose to do something else with them. We look at the CDBGs. And when we do that, we look at this as $150 billion spent over 40 years, without the appreciable benefits to show for that type of taxpayer expenditure. And that's why we have the reduction.Q  May I follow up on that?DIRECTOR MULVANEY: No, because I'm going to -- how Sean does this every day for an hour and a half, I have no idea. (Laughter.) But I'm going to --MR. SPICER: No, keep going. (Laughter.) DIRECTOR MULVANEY: Yeah, exactly. (Laughter.) I've been up since 4:00 a.m. this morning, so I'm going to turn it back over to Sean. Thank you very much. And we'll talk to you all soon.MR. SPICER: Thanks, guys. Anyway, so to kick it off, Jonathan Karl.Q  So, Sean, the day before yesterday you said you were extremely confident that the House and Senate Intelligence Committees would ultimately vindicate the President's allegation that Trump Tower was wiretapped. As I'm sure you have now seen, the Senate Intelligence Committee has said they see no indications Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance. That seems to be a pretty blanket statement. What's your reaction?MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's several things. It's interesting to me that, just as a point of interest, that when one entity says one thing that proves -- that claims one things, you guys cover it ad nauseam. When Devin Nunes came out and said, I think it's very possible -- yesterday -- it was crickets from you guys. When Devin Nunes came out and said there was no connection that he saw to Russia -- crickets. When Tom Cotton said the same. You don't want to cover the stuff --Q  Devin Nunes said he saw no evidence of wiretapping at Trump Tower.MR. SPICER: No, no, hold on -- actually --Q  Now you've had the House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee --MR. SPICER: No, no, actually heres his quote, Jonathan. No, heres the direct quote: I think its very possible.That's what he said when he said the Presidents communications could have been swept up in collection.So again --Q  He said there was no -- ""I saw no indication of wiretapping"" -- no evidence of wiretapping.MR. SPICER: I understand that. And I think the President has been very clear when he talked about this -- and he talked about it last night -- when he talked about wiretapping he meant surveillance, and that there have been incidents that have occurred. Devin Nunes couldnt have stated it more beautifully. But you choose not to cover that part. You chose not to cover when Tom Cotton went out, when Richard Burr went out, when others -- Chairmen Nunes and others -- and said that there was no -- hold on --Q  Well, the Senate Intelligence Committee is saying point blank -- they say no evidence of surveillance.  MR. SPICER: I understand that, Jonathan. And where was your passion, and where was your concern when they all said that there was no connection to Russia? Where was it then? Crickets from you guys. Because at the end of the day when --Q  So you're saying the President stands by his allegation that President Obama wiretapped the Trump Tower?MR. SPICER: No, no, no, hold on. Hold on. Im making a point. The point is this: Number one, that its interesting how when evidence comes out and people who have been briefed on the Russia connection come out and say that there was nothing that they have seen that proves a connection, you choose not to cover that, you don't stop the narrative, you continue to perpetuate a false narrative.When he came out yesterday and said, I see no evidence that this happened; when he said, I think its very possible, but like I said, we should know later, you don't cover that part. You only cover the parts that -- but lets go through what we do know. Okay? Q  I want you to respond to the Senate Intelligence Committee. MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on, let me -- and I am trying to answer your question, Jonathan, if you can calm down.If you look at what The New York Times reported on January 12th, 2017, they said, In its final days, the Obama administration has expanded the power of the National Security Agency to share globally intercepted personal communications with the governments 16 other intelligence agencies before applying privacy protections. The new rules significantly relax longstanding limits on what the NSA may do with the information gathered by its most powerful surveillance operation, which are largely unregulated by wiretapping laws.When Sara Carter reported that ""by the start of the new year, it brought with it unexpected politicizing of the intelligence gathered in secret. Separately, the Obama administration amended a longstanding executive order, allowing information intercepted through FISA warrants or by the National Security Agency to be shared by a wider audience and 16 government agencies as Obama was leave office, intelligence normally reserved for just a handful of intelligence leaders was spread throughout briefings to scores of workers, and soon leaks began appearing in news media office organizations, often in stories lacking context of how national security investigations are actually concluded.""On March 3rd, Fox News chief anchor Bret Baier said that the following: ""There was a report in June 2016 -- a FISA request by the Obama administration -- Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court -- to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several other campaign officials. Then they got turned down. Then in October, then they renewed it and did a startup wiretap at Trump Tower with some computer and Russian banks."" Baier continues, A June FISA request that foreign intelligence surveillance courts gets shot down. A judge says -- hold -- Jonathan, Im going to -- you can ask -- you can follow up -- A judge says no-go to monitoring Trump Tower. They go back in October. They do get a FISA granted. This is wiretap going on and a monitoring of computers that have some ties, they believe, to Russian accounts. By all accounts, they dont come up with anything in the investigation, but the investigation continues and we dont know it.On November 11th, 2016, days after the election, Heat Street reported, Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community had confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought and was granted a FISA warrant in October, giving counter-surveillance intelligence permission to examine the activities of U.S. persons in Donald Trumps campaign with ties to Russia. The first request, which sources say named Trump, was denied back in June. But the second was drawn more narrowly and granted in October after evidence was presented of a server, possibly related to the Trump campaign and its alleged links to two banks -- SVB bank and Russias Alfa-Bank. Sources suggest that a FISA warrant was granted to look at the full context of related documents that concern U.S. persons. Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed that the FBI sought and was granted a FISA warrant in October giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activity of U.S. persons in Donald Trumps campaign with ties to Russia.They go on: The FISA warrant was granted in connection with investigation of suspected activities between the server and two banks. However, it is thought that the intelligence community that the warrant covers any U.S. person connected to this U.N. investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at least three further men who have either formed part of his campaign or acted as media surrogates.On January 19th, the New York Times reported the following: American law enforcement and intelligence agencies are examining intercepted communication and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation of possible links between Russian officials and associates of President-elect Donald J. Trump. One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications have been provided to the White House. It is unclear which Russian officials under investigation or what particular conversations caught the attention of American eavesdroppers. The legal standard for opening these investigations is low.Andy McCarthy, writing in National Review, suggested: From three reports, from the Guardian, Heat Street and the New York Times, it appears the FBI has concerns about a private server in Trump Tower that was connected to one or two Russian banks. Heat Street describes these concerns as centering on possible financial and banking offenses. This is his quote -- I italicized the word offenses because it denotes crimes. Ordinarily, when crimes are suspected, there is a criminal investigation, not a national security investigation.We go on. Sara Carter from Circa, reporting, Intelligence professionals tell Circa News they were concerned that some of the Russian intelligence was spread through group briefings to a much-larger-than-usual audience back in January. This would have happened during the final days of the Obama administration when it expanded executive order 12333, which allows employees with a need to know have further unfettered access to raw data stowed by the NSA. The new rules allowed the NSA to share raw signals intelligence information, including the names of those involved in phone conversations and emails. The expansion of the order makes it difficult to narrow in on the leaks and, frankly, it allows too many people access to the raw data, which only used to be available to a select few, said a U.S. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity and was not granted to speak on the authority. Numerous outlets, including the New York Times, have reported on the FBI investigation into Mr. Trumps advisors; BBC, and then McClatchy revealed the existence of a multi-agency working group to coordinate investigations across the thing. On February 14th, the New York Times again refers to phone record and intercepted calls -- let me quote them -- American law enforcement intelligence agency intercepted the communications around the same times they were discovering the evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three officials said. The intelligence agencies then thought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on hacking or other efforts to influence the election. The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that so far they have seen no evidence of such cooperation. The official said that the intercepted communications are not limited to Trump campaign officials and other associates of Mr. Trump. The call logs and intercepted communications are part of a larger trove of information that the FBI is sifting through.Days later, the New York Times then reports, In the Obama administrations last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election of Donald Trump, connections between the President-elect and Russians across the government. But the increasingly hard-to-escape conclusion that in our government -- that individuals in our government were instead trying to undermine the new President by saying, quote -- this is the New York Times again -- At intelligence agencies, there was a push to process as much raw intelligence in a possible analysis to keep the report at relatively low classification levels to ensure a widespread readership across the government. And in some cases, among them, European allies. This allowed the upload of as much information -- intelligence as possible to Intellipedia, a secret Wiki used by American analysts to share information. Sean Hannity went on Fox to say, But protections which are known as minimization procedures have been put in place to protect Americans that are not under warrant, American citizens that are caught up in their surveillance. And, By the way, their identities are protected. Their constitutional rights are protected. Now, of course, this was not the case with Lieutenant General Flynn, because a transcript of his call was created and then given to intelligence officials who then leaked this information, which is a felony, to the press that printed it.Last, on Fox News on March 14th, Judge Andrew Napolitano made the following statement. Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command. He didnt use the NSA, he didnt use the CIA, he didnt use the FBI, and he didnt use the Department of Justice. He used GCHQ, what is that? Its the initials for the British Intelligence Spying Agency. So simply, by having two people saying to them, the President needs transcripts of conversations involved in candidate Trumps conversations involving President-elect Trump, he was able to get it and theres no American fingerprints on this.Putting the published accounts and common sense together, this leads to a lot.Q  So, Sean, are you saying that despite the findings, the bipartisan findings of the Senate Intelligence Committee --MR. SPICER: No, theyre not findings. Theres a statement out today. They have not begun this -- as you know, yesterday, or two days ago, the Department of Justice asked for an additional week. So the statement clearly says that at this time, that they dont believe that. They have yet to go through the information. The Department of Justice, as you know, has not supplied this. But Ive just read off to you -- its interesting, when the New York Times reports --Q  I let you do that whole long answer. Can I just ask my question?MR. SPICER: Thank you. Appreciate it.Q  Okay. So are you saying that the President still stands by his allegation that President Obama ordered wiretapping or surveillance of Trump Tower, despite the fact that the Senate Intelligence Committee says they see no indication that it happened? Does the President still stand by the allegation?MR. SPICER: No, but -- first of all, he stands by it, but again, youre mischaracterizing what happened today. Q  No, the Senate has no indication. Im reading exactly from their statement. MR. SPICER: I understand that. And at the same time, they acknowledge that they have not been in contact with the Department of Justice. Again, Id go back to what I said at the beginning. Its interesting --Q  Theyve been briefed by the FBI Director. They've been -- MR. SPICER: Hold on. Its interesting how at the same time, where were you coming to the defense of that same intelligence committee and those members when they said there was no connection to Russia? You didnt seem to report it then. There was no --Q  Because --MR. SPICER: No, no, no, so you want -- hold on, you want to comment and you want to perpetuate a false narrative.Q  Actually, I did report that Clapper said that. I actually did. MR. SPICER: But when those individuals have gone out time and time again, when Chairman Nunes has said, number one, that there was no information that hes aware of that that existed, that got zero reporting. Number two, when he went out yesterday and said, I think its very possible, you dont include that in the question mark.The bottom line is, is that the President said last night that he will be -- that there will be additional information coming forward. Theres a ton of media reports out there that indicate that something was going on during the 26 [2016] election. And I think its interesting, where was the question of the New York Times or these other outlets when that was going on? Where was the question --Q  So hell be vindicated. You think hes going to be vindicated.MR. SPICER: I believe he will. Jim.Q  Yeah, you were just quoting Sean Hannity there. The House and Senate intelligence committees are quoting the FBI Director. Youre citing Sean Hannity and Andrew Napolitano.MR. SPICER: I also quoted -- I get youre going to cherry-pick -- no, no, okay, you also tend to overlook all of the other sources that -- because I know you want to cherry-pick it. But at the -- no, no, but you do. But where was your concern about the New York Times reporting? You didnt seem to have a concern with that.Q  We have done plenty of reporting on all of this, Sean.MR. SPICER: No, no, but you want to cherry-pick one piece of commentary --Q  These connections between the aides of the President -- associates of the President to the Russians has all been looked at and its --MR. SPICER: No, wait, how do you know all this? How do you seem to be such an expert on this? Q  Im saying that this has been looked at, Sean. We've all looked at it. MR. SPICER: How do you know its been looked at?Q  There have been --MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on, where is -- Im sorry, Im afraid to understand -- can you tell me how you know that all of this has been looked at?Q  Youre asking me whether or not its been looked at?MR. SPICER: You made a statement, you said, All of this has been looked at.Q  Our outlet, other outlets have reported --MR. SPICER: No, no, so -- okay, so when your outlet says its all been looked at --Q  -- on contacts between associates and aides of the President and the Russians during the 2016 campaign. It sounds like during the context of that investigation there might have been some intercepted communications. The House Intelligence Committee Chairman did mention that, and we have reported that, others have reported that on our air and in various publications. But, Sean, what you are refusing to answer -- the question that youre refusing to answer is whether or not the President still believes what he believes --MR. SPICER: No, Im not -- I just said to Jonathan. I didnt refuse --Q  But you have a Senate and House Intelligence Committee, both leaders from both parties on both of those panels saying that they dont see any evidence of any wiretapping. So how can the President go on and continue to say these things?MR. SPICER: Because thats not -- because youre mischaracterizing what Chairman Nunes said. He said, I think its possible -- hes following up on this. So to suggest that is actually -- and youre stating unequivocally that you somehow --Q  He said, if you take the President literally -- he said, if you take the President literally, he is wrong.MR. SPICER: Right, and I think that weve already cleared that up. And he said exactly that. But the President has already said clearly when he referred to wiretapping he was referring to surveillance.Q  Right, but it sounds like, Sean, that you and the President are saying now, well, we dont mean wiretapping anymore because thats not true anymore, so now were going to expand that to other forms of surveillance. Whats it going to be next?MR. SPICER: No, no, Jim, I think thats cute, but at the end of the day -- weve talked about this for three or four days. The President had wiretapping in quotes; he was referring to broad surveillance. And now youre basically going back. We talked about this several days ago. The bottom line is, is that the investigation by the House and the Senate has not been provided all of the information. And when it does --Q  It sounds like your information is news reports, not evidence, not conversations with the FBI Director. MR. SPICER: No, no, what -- I think the President addressed that last night. He said theres more to come. These are merely pointing out that I think there is widespread reporting that throughout the 2016 election there was surveillance that was done on a variety of people that came up.Q  There was an investigation going on into whether there were contacts between the Presidents campaign and the Russians. Of course, theyre going to be looking at these various things. I mean, isnt that right? MR. SPICER: I get it. Somehow you seem to believe that you have all of this information, youve been read in on all of these things, which I find very interesting.Q  I havent been read in by the FBI Director, but the House and Senate Intelligence Committees have been.MR. SPICER: Well, no, youre coming to some serious conclusions for a guy that has zero intelligence -- (laughter) --Q  Give me some credit, Sean. MR. SPICER: Ill give you some --Q  A little intelligence maybe. But no, what Im saying is that --MR. SPICER: Clearance. I wasnt done. Clearance. Maybe both.Q  Well, come on, now. Those two panels have spoken with the FBI Director and have been told theres no evidence of this. So why not just -- why cant we just end this farce and just have the President say he was wrong?MR. SPICER: Okay, I think this question has been asked and answered, Jim. Its interesting how you jump to all of these conclusions about what they have and what they dont have, and you seem to know all the answers. But at the end of the day, there was clearly a ton of reporting --Q  So a week from now, we're going to be wrong, you're going to be right?MR. SPICER: Hold on, Jim. Let me answer -- I think that there has been a vast amount of reporting, which I just detailed, about activity that was going on in the 2016 election. Theres no question that there was surveillance techniques used throughout this I think by a variety of outlets that have reported this activity concluded.And I think when you actually ask those two people whether or not -- and as Chairman Nunes said yesterday, when you take it literally and -- wiretapping, the President has already been very clear that he didnt mean specifically wiretapping. He had it in quotes. So I think to fall back on that is a false premise. Thats not what he said. He was very clear about that when he talked about it yesterday.Major.Q  So just to be clear, youre good and the President is good with stories that have anonymous sources in them.MR. SPICER: No, its interesting -- I think when it comes to the Russia story, and the on-the-record sources who have been briefed by the FBI continue to conclude that theres nothing there, you guys continue to fall back on these anonymous sources and perpetuate a false narrative. And yet when it comes to us talking about all these reports in there, you then criticize the anonymous sources.Q  I'm just asking. MR. SPICER: No, its just interesting that sort of the double standard that exists when it comes to us citing stories when it comes -- and then how you intend to use them.Q  So let me ask you what the President said last night. He was asked by Tucker Carlson -- ""youre in charge of the various intelligence apparatus that report to you. You can ask them."" And he said --MR. SPICER: And again --Q  Can I ask my question? MR. SPICER: Yeah.Q  He said he was reluctant to do that. So let me just put two things together. Earlier this week, you told us, when asked, ""Has the President directed the Justice Department to collect and distribute information to the various relevant congressional committees?"" If I remember your answer correctly, it was, ""No, we hadnt given that specific direction."" Has that changed? MR. SPICER: No.Q  Has he now directed the Justice Department?MR. SPICER: No.Q  And is he asking, himself, for the intelligence agencies that report to him, to provide him specific answers to these underlying questions that are separate from the reports youre citing?MR. SPICER: No.Q  Why not?MR. SPICER: Because I think -- weve covered this before. I think that gets into interfering, and I think that the appropriate process is to allow the House and the Senate to do this so that it doesnt appear as though were interfering --Q  But interfering --MR. SPICER: I understand that. But I mentioned to you this the other day, Major. If we go ask them, then youre going to turn around and say, you guys interfered with something and you pressured them. Its a catch-22 for us. And the bottom line is, is that I think the President made it clear two Sundays ago that he wanted the House and Senate Intelligence Committee to work with these agencies to collect the information and make a report. Thats what were doing, in order to make sure that there is a separation from us so that you cant turn around and then accuse us of forcing or pressuring an agency to produce a document. Were asking them to go through the process of the separation of powers, and actually going to those different entities. The Department of Justice said, yesterday, that they want an additional week, and were allowing that process to play through.Got it? Abby.Q  Sean, is the President making these statements based on classified information?MR. SPICER: Im not going to get into what how the President makes a decision. I think that what I think is clear though is -- through the reporting that I just read -- is that theres clearly widespread open-source material pointing to surveillance that was conducted during the 2016 election.Q  (Inaudible) that that information is available to members of the House and the Senate. Its public, as you noted. They are looking at that same information, and they came to the conclusion that they have not seen --MR. SPICER: No, no, thats not true.Q  -- any evidence to back up the Presidents claim. So if there is other information, why wont the President release it?MR. SPICER: Again, Im not going to get into that yet. I think the President discussed that last night on his interview, and well let the process play out. I understand what he discussed --Q  He discussed these reports --MR. SPICER: I understand what he discussed. They have clearances in the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees. Theyre able to conduct this.Alexis.Q  Sean, Id like to ask you about two topics, but can you help us a little by calling on Peter right now? MR. SPICER: No, Im going to --Q  Call it --MR. SPICER: I understand. I actually call the question. Alexis, if you dont want to answer the question I can call on somebody else.Q  Could you call on the New York Times, please?MR. SPICER: No, thank you. Gabi.Q  Thanks, Sean. In the case that Judge Watson issued against the restraining order against Trumps second travel -- sorry, the Presidents second travel ban, he included one of the Presidents tweets and this was also included in the Washington State case. So Im wondering, does it give the President any pause that this virtual paper trail is creating -- is having an impact on advancing his agenda?MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think that the Department of Justices statement speaks for itself when it comes to that last night. But the federal law that I read out clearly gives the President the authority. This is what we argued during the first one. I think for a judge to ignore that statute and talk about tweets or interpreting something that happened during the campaign trail is not in keeping with how theyre supposed to interpret the law. Im not going to continue to comment.We tailored that additional -- that second executive order to comply with the judges order. I think -- so to go back now and to say, well, based on how the first order was conceived makes absolutely no sense. But Im going to let the Department of Justice litigate that, how they do it.The second order literally was tailored to the concerns that were rendered by the 9th Circuit in the first executive order. So for them to then turn around the make arguments that are non-germane seems kind of odd. But Ill let the Department of Justice do that.Zeke.Q  Is the President concerned that comments made by his staff came up in this lawsuit? It shows comments by Stephen Miller, saying that the second travel ban would have roughly the same policy outcome as the first, that was the intent that that was used by the judge in that case to sort of -- to get that (inaudible) yesterday. Is he concerned that theres mixed messaging coming out of the West Wing on this ban?MR. SPICER: No, hes not. And I think that the Department of Justice will be pursuing avenues that will seek to remedy this. I think when you read through the courts ruling in Hawaii in particular, it just doesnt seem to make sense.As I mentioned to Gabi, the second executive order was literally tailored. So to go back and talk about statements that occurred, in some cases, well before even the first one, seems to not be an accurate reading of the law. But Ill let the Department of Justice be the ones that argue this and make the appropriate legal argument.Hunter. Olivier, Im sorry.Q  I have one more for you. To go back to your long list of sort of news reports you mentioned -- one that you reached that perhaps the GCHQ was involved. Did the President ever raise this in his conversation with Theresa May? And if that were to pan out, would that imperil the special relationship between the two?MR. SPICER: Again, these are just -- that happened I think two days ago. It was something that was reported on air. I think the point is, is that theres been --Q  Was it raised --MR. SPICER: No, no, it has not been raised. But I do think that, again, were not -- all were doing is literally reading off what other stations and people have reported, and I think that casts into concern some of the activities that may have occurred during the 16 election. Were not casting judgment on that. I think the idea is to say that if these organizations, these individuals came to these conclusions, they merit looking into.Olivier.Q  Thanks, Sean. I got a couple for you. Theres a news report about the Presidents meeting with the Saudi Defense Minister/Deputy Crown Prince that says that the defense minister told the President about a plot, a terrorist plot against the United States. Did that happen? Whats the nature of that? How worried should Americans be?MR. SPICER: Were obviously never going to comment on any kind of specific threats to the homeland. Were obviously committed to ensuring the safety of every American. But it should be no secret that we share intelligence amongst a variety of countries, and so we would never comment on a potential threat or not that existed. But we appreciate several countries that we work with closely to make sure that we do what we can to protect the homeland.Q  One more. Secretary Tillerson in Asia said that 20 years of diplomatic efforts have failed to get North Korea to denuclearize. Thats plainly true, but the question I guess that comes up is does the President plan a break from diplomacy altogether? Are we looking now at only the use of force or some other coercive measures?MR. SPICER: Im not going to comment. I think the President never takes anything off the table. Thats something hes been very clear about, and -- with that. Blake.Q  Sean, over the course of the campaign the President made a couple different -- many comments about the budget and the deficit. At one point, he said he thought that he could get rid of the national debt over the course of eight years. At another point he said that he would insist on a balanced budget relatively soon. Now the base line that the administration is giving us is, well at least were not adding onto the deficit, which is nearly half a trillion dollars. So Im curious as to how we got from that point to now, to where -- he was talking at one point about eliminating a bunch, and now its adding onto it.MR. SPICER: I think Director Mulvaney addressed that. I think -- look, a couple things. Number one, the Senate dragged its feet on getting Director Mulvaney confirmed and in office. So I think we were way -- we were behind the curve in having a director of OMB. We got in here -- I think we produced a blueprint that is consistent with the Presidents principles and priorities. But hes already made it very clear that we'll have a budget probably sometime in May that will outline the more specifics of the revenue piece, the entitlement piece, and the full details of all this.But eliminating a $20 trillion debt and tackling the current deficit is something that's going to take a little bit of time and something that the President is committed to reducing. I think we've talked very extensively about the Presidents commitment to protecting taxpayer dollars and using them more efficiently. This budget and a lot of the action the President took on other projects, including the F18 and the next generation of AF1, show that the President is committed on a very, very personal basis to getting involved in programs and policies to reduce the deficit and respect taxpayer money. So this is step one, and it's a down payment on that goal.Q  Are there future steps -- there are lots of cuts in here, but no matter which way you splice the numbers, anyone will tell you, if you want to drop it somehow youve got to get to entitlements.MR. SPICER: I understand.Q  Is that on the table potentially, yes or no?MR. SPICER: As Director Mulvaney put it, he was chosen for this job because of his commitment to fiscal austerity and respect of taxpayer dollars and budgeting skills. And I think that we've got to get passed today. Let us get down that and we'll have more for you.But again, I think this budget is a huge down payment on the Presidents goal of showing his commitment to fiscal responsibility and respecting the taxpayer.Eamon.Q  Sean, tax day is coming up. A lot of Americans put together their tax returns. When the President puts together his tax returns this year, will he release it publicly? Presumably he's not under audit, right?MR. SPICER: Well, St. Patricks Day is tomorrow -- that's what I'm more focused on. Q  Presumably, his 2016 returns are not under audit yet. MR. SPICER: Right. Again, we'll cross that bridge when it comes to it. I think the President has been very clear about his position on his tax returns, and we'll have to see where it goes from there. But the President has been very clear throughout the campaign and consistent that hes under a routine audit.John.Q  Thank you, Sean. Reading the draft of the budget and listening to Director Mulvaneys comments yesterday and today, it would appear that the National Endowment of the Arts would be phased out entirely in two years. Can you name any other government programs or even Cabinet departments -- such as Housing and Urban Development, and Education -- in which its entire function may be phased out or reduced to another agency in government or even the state?MR. SPICER: John, those here from OMB is the appropriate person to ask on that. I know that theyve done several briefings on the budget. We can have OMB definitely get back to you on this. If you can contact him after this.Kaitlan.Q  Going back to the fact that the President used wiretap in quotes, and last night he said it was very important that it was in quotes, but out of the four tweets when he accuses Barack Obama of wiretapping him he only used quotes in two of them. In two of them he specifically said that he tapped his phones. He didnt use the term, wiretapping. And just minutes ago, you said it was communications being swept up. So can you definitively say that he still feels like Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, or does he feel like it was broadly surveilled? Which is it?MR. SPICER: Look, he was very clear about this last night. He talked about it, as you said --Q  He wasnt --MR. SPICER: Yeah, he was. He said that he meant it, he put it in quotes, it was very broad. And so that's what he meant by the use of the term. Q  But was it phone-tapping? Was it --MR. SPICER: No, it was surveillance. I think we've covered this like 10 times.Q  There's no specific answer of what it was. What did President Obama do to --MR. SPICER: I understand that, but that's the point of them looking into this, Kaitlan. I think the idea is to look into this, have the House and Senate Intelligence Committees look into this and report back.Q  I want to follow up on that. If all this comes out and theres no proof that President Obama had any role in any wiretapping, if there was no wiretapping, will President Trump then offer an apology to President Obama?MR. SPICER: I was asked this like three times this week and I think the answer is we're not going to prejudge what the outcome of this is. I think we've got to let the process work its will, and then when theres a report that comes out conclusive from there, then we'll be able to comment. But to jump ahead of this process at this point would be inappropriate.And I go to Bryan Crabtree of Salem Radio, Georgia.Q  Thank you, Sean, for taking questions from a talk-radio host right here in Georgia and not in the D.C. swamp. First, I have two questions. First, to the Presidents tax returns and classified information. President Trump campaigned on draining the swamp. The American people then want to know why he (inaudible). And Commissioner (inaudible) has not yet been fired by the Trump administration. My second question is with regard to there are -- many conservatives are really concerned that Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, is leading President Trump down a very wrong path on healthcare. How do you react to that?MR. SPICER: Well, on the first one, there's no personnel updates with respect to -- with the exception of the ones that I mentioned today. On the second, Donald Trump is not one to be led down a path by anyone. I think he is -- he talked today at the lunch with the Taoiseach and Speaker Ryan that hes working hand-in-glove with the Speaker. He talked about it last night. This is a commitment that he has to enacting healthcare. This is a process that he is committed to, wants to see through because of a goal that he wants to achieve, which is making a more patient-centric healthcare system that lowers the cost and increases the options.But he doesnt get led down any path. He leads very clearly. And I think if you listen to Speaker Ryan today, hes in agreement that theres been a strong partnership between the House, the administration and I think the Senate so far to make sure that we get this bill done. And that's what our goal is going to be, and that's -- so I would argue that we've actually done a pretty good job of getting that done.Jonathan.Q  I want to ask you about the decision to cut the National Institutes of Health budget by 19 percent. It's, as you know, a very important part of the government funding medical research. Budget Director Mulvaney yesterday acknowledged that the private sector can't fill that gap. When there are rare diseases, we do need a really robust government presence. The President invited a rare-disease patient to his speech to Congress to talk about medical innovation. How do you square those things when you're cutting NIH by 19 percent? And many conservatives actually wanted to increase the budget.MR. SPICER: I think Director Mulvaney actually -- somebody asked him during the Q&A period the same question.Q  But he suggested that it wouldn't -- like my take from listening to him yesterday was that it wouldn't be cut. I mean, I almost wrote that.MR. SPICER: Theres this assumption in Washington, Jonathan, that if you get less money it's a cut. And I think that the reality is that in a lot of these theres efficiencies, duplicity, ways to spend money better. And I think if you're wasting a lot of money, thats not a true dollar spent. And I think when you look at the way that Director Mulvaney and the President approached this budget, it was can we ask -- can we get more with the same dollar, can we find duplicity, can we find efficiencies, can we combine facilities in some cases at NIH to enhance a better experience whereby we actually have an outcome thats reduced savings.But to assume that because you spend a ton of dollars youre going to get a better outcome, I mean, with all due respect, you look at the District of Columbia, they spend by far more per capita than any other city in the country on education, and I think they have tremendous issues that are constantly being dealt with in their education system.So to assume that just because you throw money at a problem its somehow magically solved is a very Washington way of looking at a budget problem.Q  But they believe --MR. SPICER: I understand that, and I think part of the issues that were working -- as the Director outlined a couple weeks ago during the passback process, is to work with them to talk to each of these agencies and departments about how to walk through their budget in a way that ensures they can continue to do the core functions that they want while finding ways to reduce waste, get rid of -- enhance efficiencies and get rid of duplicity.But that is a very Washington way of looking at a problem, when you say, lets just look at how much we spend as a measure of how much we care or how much were going to get done. And I think that the President has been very clear as to what his priorities on this budget are and the outcomes that we expect from every dollar that we spend. So for being in office for 55 days, or 50-some-odd days, whatever its been, weve had a unique ability to go forward so far and make a very strong commitment to enhancing our national security, to protect the country and to keep America safe and its citizens safe, while at the same time making sure that we dont ask for people to work harder, to spend more to Washington -- send more to Washington that gets ultimately wasted. I just dont see how thats showing respect to the American people or to the American taxpayer, especially when so many people are working two, sometimes three jobs, or both parents are working just to get by, pay the mortgage, and were saying, hey, dont worry, keep sending more money to Washington -- and were not going to take the time.But there should be a review of all these agencies. Director Mulvaney was pointing out how many unauthorized agencies and departments and programs we have throughout the government. If were going to do that, at some point there should be a debate on whether or not these agencies and programs are achieving their mission. And if they are then great, fund them. But if theyre not, we shouldnt be asking hardworking American taxpayers to send more money to Washington to fund things that dont further those goals.Thank you guys very much. I look forward to seeing you all tomorrow. Take care. Have a good one.END4:15 P.M. EDT",20934.55,-15.549999999999272,5900.76,0.7100000000000364,2381.38,-3.880000000000109

359,2017-03-16,Text of a Letter from the President to the Speaker of the House of Representatives,"March 16, 2017Dear Mr. Speaker:I ask the Congress to consider the enclosed appropriations request for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017. The request includes an additional $30billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) to rebuild the U.S. Armed Forces and accelerate the campaign to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and an additional $3billion for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for urgent border protection activities.This appropriations request would provide $24.9 billion in the DOD base budget for urgent warfighting readiness needs and to begin a sustained effort to rebuild the U.S. Armed Forces. The request seeks to address critical budget shortfalls in personnel, training, maintenance, equipment, munitions, modernization, and infrastructure investment. It represents a critical first step in investing in a larger, more ready, and more capable military force.The request also includes $5.1 billion in the Overseas Contingency Operations budget for DOD to accelerate the campaign to defeat ISIS and support Operation Freedom's Sentinel in Afghanistan. This request would enable DOD to pursue a comprehensive strategy to end the threat ISIS poses to the United States.In addition, this appropriations request would provide an additional $3 billion for DHS implementation of my executive orders on border security and immigration enforcement. The request would fund efforts to plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, and make other critical investments in tactical border infrastructure and technology. The request also proposes funding to increase immigration detention capacity, which is necessary to ensure the removal of illegal aliens from the United States. Finally, the request funds new recruiting capacity at DHS so that it may hire additional immigration law enforcement officers and agents.In conjunction with this request, I recommend that the Congress enact non-defense discretionary reductions of $18billion in FY2017, which would fully offset the amounts proposed for DHS and would offset half of the amounts proposed for DOD.The details of this proposal are set forth in the enclosed letter from the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.Sincerely,DONALD J.

Secretary Prices response stated: In your March 14 editorial about the Congressional Budget Offices score of the American Health Care Act, you wrote: The numbers are the numbers. The C.B.O. has called it as it sees it, and the picture is clear. As Ive said, I strenuously disagree, and so did your editorial board.As you wrote in a Feb. 3, 1994, editorial about President Bill Clintons health care proposal, The Budget Offices estimates of savings from health care reform, through no fault of its own, are guesswork.This weeks C.B.O. assessment, which you praise, finds that with almost no changes in subsidies or Medicaid, 14 million Americans will drop their insurance next year. That is worse than guesswork; it is simply unbelievable.The Budget Office scored a Republican bill that is just one part of President Trumps plan to provide affordable, quality health care to every American. It is a great disservice to your readers to ascribe such certainty to the Budget Offices numbers, and to offer no mention of the other reforms in progress.Read the entire letter here.",20934.55,-15.549999999999272,5900.76,0.7100000000000364,2381.38,-3.880000000000109

Thanks to combined national, State, and local efforts over the course of years, Americans have reduced childhood fatalities related to accidental poisoning in the United States from 200 deaths per year to 27 per year, which is an 88 percent decline. From a public health perspective, this is a resounding achievement.Fifty-five years ago, President John F. Kennedy noted that virtually all deaths attributable to accidental poisoning could be prevented. He was right  we as a society must do much more to prevent tragic and preventable loss of life from occurring. Ensuring the safety and security of the American people requires that we unequivocally commit to a continuation of the successful policies that have reduced accidental childhood poisonings and injuries.This week we warn all Americans about unintended exposure to poisons and the threat of household items unintentionally being turned into deadly weapons. This is an important reminder  and one that could save lives.To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of unintentional poisonings and to take appropriate preventative measures, on September 26, 1961, the Congress, by joint resolution (75 Stat. 681), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as, ""National Poison Prevention Week.""NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, do hereby proclaim March 19 through March 25, 2017, as National Poison Prevention Week.

365,2017-03-17,Joint Press Conference with President Trump and German Chancellor Merkel,"East Room2:09 P.M. EDTPRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Chancellor Merkel, it is a great honor to welcome you to the Peoples House, the White House. Our two nations share much in common, including our desire for security, prosperity and peace. We just concluded a productive meeting with the German and American companies to discuss workforce development and vocational training -- very important words. Germany has done an incredible job training the employees and future employees, and employing its manufacturing and industrial workforce. Its crucial that we provide our American workers with a really great employment outlook, and that includes making sure that we harness the full potential of women in our economy. My administration is in the process of rebuilding the American industrial base. A stronger America is in the interests, believe me, of the world as a whole. I reiterated to Chancellor Merkel my strong support for NATO, as well as the need for our NATO allies to pay their fair share for the cost of defense. Many nations owe vast sums of money from past years, and it is very unfair to the United States. These nations must pay what they owe. During our meeting, I thanked Chancellor Merkel for the German governments commitment to increase defense spending and work toward contributing at least 2 percent of GDP. I want to thank the Chancellor for her leadership in supporting NATO and its efforts in Afghanistan. This has come at significant cost, including the lives of over 50 German soldiers, whose sacrifice we greatly honor. I also appreciate Chancellor Merkels leadership, along with the French President, to resolve the conflict in Ukraine, where we ideally seek a peaceful solution.Most importantly, our two countries must continue to work together to protect our people from radical Islamic terrorism and to defeat ISIS. I applaud Chancellor Merkel for Germanys contributions, both civilian and military, as a counter-ISIS coalition member. We also recognize that immigration security is national security. We must protect our citizens from those who seek to spread terrorism, extremism and violence inside our borders. Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must always come first, without question.Over lunch, the Chancellor and I will talk about our economic partnership. We must work together towards fair and reciprocal trade policies that benefit both of our peoples.Millions of hardworking U.S. citizens have been left behind by international commerce, and together, we can shape a future where all of our citizens have a path to financial security.The United States will respect historic institutions, and we will also recognize the right of free people to manage their own destiny.The close friendship between America and Germany is built on our shared value. We cherish individual rights, we uphold the rule of law, and we seek peace among nations. Our alliance is a symbol of strength and cooperation to the world. It is the foundation of a very, very hopeful future.Thank you.CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (As interpreted.) Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure and privilege to be here today in the White House, together with President Donald Trump, and have a first personal, one-on-one meeting and an exchange of views.In the period leading up to this visit, Ive always said its much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another, and I think our conversation proved this. We talked about the international situation. We talked about also apprenticeship programs when we met with CEOs and apprentices around a roundtable, as regards the shared interests that we have. Let me look back into the past. We, the Germans, owe a lot to the United States of America, particularly as regards the economic rise of Germany. This was primarily due to the help through the Marshall Plan. We were also able to regain German unity after decades of the United States standing up for this, together with other allies, and standing by our side during the period of the Cold War. And we are very gratified to know that today we can live in peace and freedom as a unified country due to that.I was gratified to know that the President had aligned how important he thinks NATO is. NATO is of prime importance for us, and it was not without very good reason that we said during our summit meeting in Wales that also Germany needs to increase expenditure. We committed to this 2-percent goal until 2024. Last year we increased our defense spending by 8 percent, and were going to work together again and again on this. And we said that, obviously, defense and security has a lot of different assets and facets to it. One the one hand, its supporting missions in Africa, for example. Its also promoting development assistance, but its also helping mission in Africa, for example, in trying to stand up for their own safety and security. We continue to be in conversation. What was important for us today was that we were able to talk about Afghanistan, talk about, as the President quite rightly said, the continuing mission of Germany in Afghanistan. I am very glad that the United States are intending to continue to commit to the Afghan mission as well.Together, we fight against Islamist terrorism. Germany is going to step up its work and is going to continue its work in Afghanistan and also in Syria. Were going to monitor the situation there very closely. Were going to work on political solutions in Syria, but also in Libya -- what we talked about. I am very gratified to know that the American administration and also the President, personally, commits himself to the Minsk process. We need to come to a solution of this problem. There has to be a safe and secure solution for Ukraine, but the relationship with Russia has to be improved, as well, once the situation there on the ground is clarified.Minsk is a good basis, but, unfortunately, we havent made yet the headway that we want to. But we are going to work together with our experts in the next few months to come on this issue.I am also here in my capacity as G20 president. You know that we will be hosting the G20 visit -- the G20 Summit -- sorry -- this year, and Im very pleased that the President has committed to attending this summit. Were going to talk at some length over lunch about the issues. We say trade has to be rendered fairer, there has to be a win-win situation. We can talk about the details of that. Weve already seen today when we had an exchange with our CEOs and also with our apprentices what sort of potential we can tap, what sort our potential our two economies have. Its very moving to see, particularly meeting with these young people, what sort of work towards the future is being done by our companies there. So, particularly in this period where we are transiting from traditional manufacturing to industry -- capacity-building skills are so important, incidentally, not only for young people, but also for those who maybe have lost their jobs and need to be reskilled in order to find a job again. And that is an issue I know is very important for you here in the United States, but its also important for us in Germany.So I can say there are a number of issues where we will continue to cooperate very closely on the level of our experts, but also on our level. We had a very good first exchange of views, so Im very much looking forward to the talks we will have over lunch.Thank you. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Well do a couple of questions. Mark Halperin.Q  Mr. President, thank you. There are a lot of Americans who have anxiety now like they did eight years ago as the government debates what to do about healthcare. I'm wondering if you can tell people what your bottom lines are, whats non-negotiable. Youve talked in the past saying no one should be denied health insurance if they can't afford it. Youve talked about no cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. Are those your bottom lines and would you veto legislation that violated those?Q  Chancellor Merkel, if I could ask you, President Trump has got a different style than most recent, past U.S. Presidents. I'm wondering what you think about that style, if you think it's good for the world, or if youve got reservations about it.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you, Mark. We just have a really wonderful group of people meeting later. We met with 12 pretty much nos in Congress -- you saw that a little while ago -- and they went from all nos to all yeses and we have a lot of yeses coming in. It's all coming together. We're going to have great healthcare. It's going to be passed, I believe, I think substantially, pretty quickly. It's coming together beautifully. You have conservative groups, you have other groups. Everybody wants certain things. In the end, we're going to have a great healthcare plan.Now, I have to tell you that Obamacare is a disaster. It's failing. I was in Tennessee -- we had a tremendous crowd the other night, and they have -- half of the state is uncovered. The insurance companies have left, and the other half has one insurance company and that will probably be bailing out pretty soon also. Theyll have nobody. You have many states where they have one. You have a lot of places now where theyll have none. Obamacare will fail. It will fold. It will close up very, very soon if something isn't done.I've often said politically, the best thing I can do is absolutely nothing. Wait one year and then even the Democrats will come say, please, please, you got to help us. But it's not the right thing to do for the people. We have a great plan. We have a plan thats getting more and more popular with the Republican base, with the conservative base, and with people, generally. The press has covered it very inaccurately. People are truly covered well, and I think it's going to be something that's going to be a model to be looked upon.Q  May I ask whats non-negotiable for you, Mr. President?PRESIDENT TRUMP: I'll tell you after we're finished. (Laughter.) CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (As interpreted.) Thank you very much. Well, I'm here as Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. I represent German interests. I speak with the President of the United States, who stands up for, as is right, American interests. That is our task, respectively. And I must say that I was very gratified to know the very warm and gracious hospitality with which I have been received here.We held a conversation where we were trying to address also those areas where we disagree, but to try to bring people together, try to show what is our vantage point, what is the American vantage point, and then try to find a compromise which is good for both sides. Because we need to be fair with each other. Each and every one is expecting for his or her leader that something good comes out of it for their own people. For Germany, I can say, well, people are different. People have different abilities, have different traits of character, have different origins, have found their way into politics along different pathways. All that is diversity, which is good. Sometimes it's difficult to find compromises, but that's what we've been elected for. If everything just went like that and without problem, we wouldn't need politicians to do these jobs.Q  -- from the German Press Agency. Madam Chancellor, given the experience of the GDR, you are always saying that you are so confident that walls can fall also. How dangerous do you think this isolationist policy of the U.S. President is? What was the import of terrorists that he plans? And also, with the fact that he doesnt think that the EU -- doesnt deal with the EU in a very respectful way? And then, Mr. President, America First -- don't you think that this is going to weaken also the European Union? And why are you so scared of diversity? In the news and in the media, you speak so awful of fake news and that things, also, cannot be proven. For example, the fact that you have been wiretapped by Mr. Obama.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Nice, friendly reporter. (Laughter.) First of all, I don't believe in an isolationist policy, but I also believe a policy of trade should be a fair policy. And the United States has been treated very, very unfairly by many countries over the years. And that's going to stop.But I'm not an isolationist. I'm a free trader, but I'm also a fair trader. And free trade has led to a lot of bad things happening -- you look at the deficits that we have and you look at all of the accumulation of debt. We're a very powerful company -- country. We're a very strong, very strong country. We'll soon be at a level that we perhaps have never been before. Our military is going to be strengthened -- it's been depleted.But I am a trader. I am a fair trader. I am a trader that wants to see good for everybody, worldwide. But I am not an isolationist by any stretch of the imagination. So I don't know what newspaper you're reading, but I guess that would be another example of, as you say, fake news.CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (As interpreted.) Well, allow me, if I may, to project in the following terms. We haven't yet had time to talk at great length about economic issues, but I would say that the success of Germany in the economic area, but also on security and peace -- that the success of Germans have always been one where the German success is one side of the coin, and the other side of the coin has been European unity and European integration. That's something of which I'm deeply convinced. And I'm not only saying this back home, I'm saying this here. I'm saying it in the United States and also here in Washington in my talks with the President.Secondly, I believe that globalization ought to be shaped in an open-minded way, but also in a very fair way. Freedom of movement within the European Union, for example, is a very important element of our economic progress, of peace; has been for many, many decades. The European countries for many, many centuries waged wars against each other. We have to protect our external borders because -- and there we have to work on the basis of mutual interests with our neighbors.Migration, immigration, integration has to be worked on, obviously. Traffickers have to be stopped. But this has to be done while looking at the refugees as well, giving them opportunities to shape their own lives where they are; help countries who right now are not in an ability to do so -- sometimes because they have civil war. I think thats the right way of going about it. And this is obviously what we have an exchange of views about, but my position is the one that I have just set out for you.PRESIDENT TRUMP: I might add that we have many plants and factories coming back into the United States. Many jobs are coming back to Michigan, to Ohio, to Pennsylvania, to a lot of places where they were losing jobs. And we will have a different policy, but its going to be a great policy for not only the United States but a great policy worldwide, and I look very much forward to it.Kevin Cirilli.Q  Yes, Mr. President, (inaudible) healthcare -- what exactly does the (inaudible)? And then, for Chancellor Merkel, what do you anticipate could be a concession you would be willing to give to the administration (inaudible)?PRESIDENT TRUMP: Well, Kevin, I think we have a very unified Republican Party. After all, we have the presidency, we have the House, we have the Senate. And were getting along very well, I will tell you. And if you were at the meeting that I just attended where we took 12 nos or semi-nos -- no yeses -- and within a short period of time, everybody was very much on board, and a commitment to vote yes.I think we have a very unified party. I think we're actually more unified than even the election. You see -- when they talk about me, I seem to be very popular, at least this week, within the party because we have our highest numbers -- the highest numbers that Ive ever had in the party. So I think theres a great unification. Now, healthcare is a very, very difficult subject, its a very complex subject, and its a subject that goes both ways. You do something for one side and the other side doesnt like it. But its really something thats come together very well, and I think its going to be very, very popular -- extremely popular.On trade with Germany, I think were going to do fantastically well. Right now, I would say that the negotiators for Germany have done a far better job than the negotiators for the United States. But hopefully we can even it out. We dont want victory, we want fairness. All I want is fairness. Germany has done very well in its trade deals with the United States, and I give them credit for it, but -- and I can speak to many other countries. I mean, you look at China, you look at virtually any country that we do business with. Its not exactly what you call good for our workers. You look at the horrible NAFTA transaction -- NAFTA has been a disaster for the United States. Its been a disaster for companies, and in particular, its been a disaster for the workers. A lot of the companies just moved, but the workers are screwed. And its probably the reason Im standing here, maybe number one -- that and maybe the military -- building up our military, which we will do, and we will be stronger than ever before -- and hopefully not have to use it. But we will be stronger, and perhaps far stronger than ever before. But its probably the reason Im here, is when you talk about trade.So I think that we are going to be a very different country. I think were going to be -- were going to have great values. But in terms of our military, its going to be much stronger. And our trade deals are going to be good, solid deals. Not deals that lead to closing plants and tremendous unemployment. Okay? Thank you.CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (As interpreted.) When we speak about trade agreements, and the European Union is negotiating those agreements for all of the member states of the European Union, but obviously theres also input by the member states -- they bring to the table whats important to them.We have underlined as a German industry, German business community, and have made the experience that any kind of agreement that we have concluded -- for example, at the very latest with South Korea -- brought us more jobs, actually. People were very much concerned about losing jobs -- for example, the automotive industry -- but in the end, it turned out -- particularly as it regards South Korea -- in the end it turned out that both sides benefited. And I think its only fair. Thats the purpose of concluding agreements -- that both sides win. And that is the sort of spirit, I think, in which we ought to be guided in negotiating any agreement between the United States of America and the EU. I hope that we can resume the agreement that we started. We have just now concluded our agreement with Canada, and I hope that we will come back to the table and talk about the agreement between EU and the U.S. again.Q  Madam Chancellor, a question addressed to you. Today we're talking about trade. The President, in the past, always said that he doesnt like multinational trade agreements but he does bilateral trade agreements. Do you think from the EUs point of view, T-TIP is a bilateral agreement with Washington on one side, the EU the other side? Now, is the problem that America, the President of the United States, and the Europeans have a basically different understanding of what the EU is all about? Thats my question addressed to you.And Mr. President, my question addressed to you, if I may -- rejected White House claims, is that the alleged wiretapping on you, on the Trump Tower, on Trump organization, or on members of your campaign was -- that British intelligence was either responsible for it or involved in it? After these claims are rejected, what is your take on that? Are there other suspects, or do you think it was a mistake to blame British intelligence for this. And by the way, my second question, are there, from time to time, tweets that you regret in hindsight --PRESIDENT TRUMP: Very seldom.Q  Very seldom. So you never would have wished not to have --PRESIDENT TRUMP: Very seldom. Probably wouldnt be here right now -- but very seldom. We have a tremendous group of people that listen, and I can get around the media when the media doesnt tell the truth, so I like that.As far as wiretapping, I guess, by this past administration, at least we have something in common perhaps. (Laughter.) And just to finish your question, we said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didnt make an opinion on it. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox. And so you shouldnt be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox, okay?Q  Thank you.CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (As interpreted.) Well, I believe that the President has clearly set out his philosophy as to what trade agreements have to bring about for the American side as well. I personally dont think that Germany needs to negotiate and not the European Union. Weve devolved our competences to the European Union, so the European Union, or rather the Commission negotiates on behalf of the member states, so thats not going to prevent us from concluding agreements. Indeed, this would be then qualify as a bilateral agreement between the EU and the United States if we had it. But the question is, will it be of benefit to both countries or not, and let me be very honest, very candid -- a free trade agreement with the United States of America has not always been all that popular in Germany either. There have been less demonstrations against this free trade agreements in the United States that in Europe, and also in Germany. So I am very glad to note that apparently the perspective on that has changed a little bit at least in Germany, too.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thank you very much. Great honor. Thank you. Thank you.END2:36 P.M. EDT",20914.62,-19.93000000000029,5901.0,0.23999999999978172,2378.25,-3.130000000000109

367,2017-03-17,Remarks by President Trump and Veterans Affairs Secretary Shulkin at Veterans Affairs Listening Session ,"Roosevelt Room10:31 A.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: A special group of people. Very special to me, very important. And I want to thank you all for being here and for your work on behalf of our nations veterans, our great, great people, our veterans.Were all united by a very common mission: We will protect those who protect us. Ive been saying that a lot over the last two years at rallies and speeches. We will protect those who protect us, and thats just starting, because I think the veterans have not been treated fairly. And David and a group of brilliant, brilliant doctors and businessmen are forming a board, and youve got the most talented people that Ive ever seen working with you. This is -- no more games going to be played at the VA. And I want to thank David, your Secretary -- your new Secretary, whos going to be so outstanding. I think he actually passed 100 to nothing. When I heard that vote I said, where did that come from? A hundred to nothing, right? Passed 100 to nothing -- for bringing your vision, experience and determination to the crucial task of reforming the VA and ensuring care for our returning heroes and warriors. And tonight Im having a major meeting with some of the people that we put on a board. Ike Perlmutter is an amazing man -- Marvel -- is one of the great, great businessmen of our time, and others -- were having a meeting tonight at what we call affectionately the Southern White House. Seems to be the most convenient location. Everybody always wants to go to the Southern White House. So are you going to be at that meeting? You heard about it, right? Its going to be great -- all about the VA. The VAs mission statement is engraved in the plaques outside its headquarters. It reads: To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan. And that was stated by Abraham Lincoln. That was Lincolns pledge -- called Lincolns pledge. But for too many veterans, this hasnt been their experience at all. Weve been reading horrible stories over the years, and already, David, Im hearing its getting much better. A lot of improvements are being made and its going to change. And under my administration, it will change -- very important to me.During my campaign, I outlined a detailed plan to reforming veterans care throughout the country, and were working to put that plan into effect. And its moving, I think I can, honestly, ahead of schedule.As Commander-in-Chief, I will not accept substandard service for our great veterans. Every member of our government is expected to do their utmost to ensure our veterans have the care that theyre so entitled to -- maybe more entitled to than anybody. And that hasnt been the way they were treated. But it is the way theyre going to be treated.So again, I want to thank you all for being here. Its a great honor. And maybe Ill ask David just to say a few words.SECRETARY SHULKIN: Sure. Thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.SECRETARY SHULKIN: Mr. Vice President. I wanted to let you know the people in this room are some of the most dedicated, passionate people advocating for our veterans. And they are our partners in this quest to transform VA. And we really are so grateful that theyre here with us standing as partners. I also want to thank you, Mr. President, for the budget. I think that youve honored your commitment to showing that this country cares about the veterans, and youve given us the ability to make sure that we are able to care for them. I also wanted to tell you that yesterday the House passed an accountability bill, and were very, very grateful for Chairman Roes leadership and for the Houses leadership in doing that. Were looking forward to the Senate bringing a bill forward.And so, I think, as you said, were committed to the plan that you outlined during your campaign to making the VA the type of organization that Americans want it to be, and were well on our way to do that. So thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT: Well, thats great. And unrelated, we just had a meeting with probably 12 congressmen, and it was an amazing meeting because they were all nos, would you say, Mike? They were all nos or pretty much no, and after 15 minutes -- now, in all fairness, not 15 minutes, it was really actually about four or five days, but after 15 minutes, they went from no to all yeses. So the healthcare looks like its going to be in great shape. Its a great plan. The press doesnt give it a fair read but Ive heard that before. What are you going to do -- the fake news.But its a great plan or I wouldnt be involved with it. I wouldnt be involved. So you have 12 nos, and we have rejiggered it and weve done some great things, but the nos in every single case went to a yes. So that was a great honor, and healthcare looks like its really happening, and its going to great. Obamacare is dead. Some of you folks have yourself -- you have family members that have suffered greatly under Obamacare. Its dying. Its just about on its last legs. If we did nothing, if we did absolutely nothing, Obamacare is dead. It will fail. In Tennessee, where I just left, half of the state has no insurance and --no carrier. Its gone. And theyre going to leave the other half of the state very soon. You have that in many cases. Many states are down to one and theyll end up with nothing.So Obamacare is dead. Were going to come up with a replacement thats going to be fantastic. We have no support from the Democrats. Thats why its a little -- we have to go interesting little routes. Instead of just approving it, it has to be approved in pieces, and thats working out really well. But we just got 12 very, very great people that went from no or maybe -- but maybe leaning to no -- right, Mike? And they all have given me a commitment that theyre voting for our healthcare plan. So that was great.I want to thank you all for being here, and lets talk. And the press will leave. Thank you very much.END10:38 P.M.

368,2017-03-17,"Remarks by President Trump, Congressman Steve Scalise, and Congressman Mark Walker at Republican Study Committee Meeting ","Oval Office10:12 A.M. EDTMR. SCALISE: We appreciate President Trump having us into the Oval Office to talk about healthcare and the improvements that are being made. The President has worked and said, bring us your best ideas. And there are members of the Republican Study Committee who have brought those good ideas and worked in a very diligent way to ultimately get to a ""yes"" on this bill with changes that the President has asked us to make that we're going to make in the bill. And with that, I want to lead it off to the Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Mark Walker. MR. WALKER: Thank you. We're excited about today because it's historic knowing that we're getting a couple of very important things to the steering committee members -- work requirements through the country, and also something what we call ""block grants,"" which allows the states to be empowered. We believe they should be able to hold the reins when it comes to managing their population. We also think this would provide more coverage for the indigent, for those sick, and for those disabled. So we're excited about it today, and that's why we've come today to celebrate the American Health Care Act and moving forward with a ""yes.""THE PRESIDENT: I just want to say that these are folks that were either a ""no"" or a ""maybe."" And we had a nice meeting, and we've been talking all during the night. This didnt just happen over the last 20 minutes. This has been going all night long.And we are doing some incredible things. I want everyone to know I'm 100 percent behind this. I want everybody to know that the press has not been speaking properly about how great this is going to be. They have not been giving it a fair chance. The press is -- as you know, I call it the ""fake news."" This is going to be great for people. I watch -- I say, that's not the bill we're passing. And I also want everybody to know that all of these ""nos,"" or potential ""nos,"" are all ""yeses."" Every single person sitting in this room is now a ""yes."" And we made certain changes, and, frankly, little -- although the block grant is very important, because I want the states to get the money and to run their program, if they want to run it, because they can do it better than the federal government. They're better-equipped than the federal government.They also want people to know that Obamacare is dead; it's a dead healthcare plan. It's not even a healthcare plan, frankly. And I watched the architect of the plan -- yesterday I watched the old clip where he said the American people are stupid to have voted for it. I watched Bill Clinton saying, this is the craziest thing I've ever seen. And only because everyone knows it's on its last dying feat, the fake news is trying to say good things about it -- the fake media. And there is no good news about Obamacare. Obamacare is dead. And unless we gave it massive subsidies in a year from now or six months from now, it's not even going to be here. So when they say, ""Oh, more people on the plan,"" there's not going to be any people on the plan. I was in Tennessee -- I was just telling the folks -- and half of the state has no insurance company, and the other half is going to lose the insurance company. The people dont know what to do. It's a disaster. Obamacare is dead. Nothing to do with these people. Nothing to do with me. It's on respirator and it's just about ready to implode.Now, we could wait for six months or a year and let it happen. It's not the right thing to do for the people. This is a great plan. This is going to be fantastic. You're going to have bidding at the one level by insurance companies. And remember this -- remember this: Those lines are going to come out, you're going to have bidding by insurance companies like you've never seen before. Plans are going to come out like nobody has ever seen before. Plans that nobody has even thought of now are going to be devised by insurance companies to take care of people. And we're going to take care of people at all levels. So I just want to let the world know: I am 100 percent in favor. These folks -- and they are tough, and they love their constituents, and they love this country -- these folks were ""Nos"" -- mostly ""Nos"" -- yesterday. And now every single one is a ""yes."" And I just want to thank you. We're going to have a healthcare plan that's going to be second to none. It's going to be great. And the people will see that.And, by the way, it will take a little while -- because before it all kicks in and welds together, it takes a little while. With Obamacare it got worse and worse. Premiums went up 116 percent. They went up 58 percent. The Governor of Minnesota said that Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare -- no longer affordable. That's what he said. The Affordable Care Act is no longer affordable. And he's the guy that -- he's a good Democrat, he wanted Obamacare. He said it's no longer affordable. Obamacare is not an alternative. It's not there. It's dead. It's dead.So I just want to say thank you very much. I really appreciate it. One hundred percent of the ""Nos"" are ""Yeses."" And some of them were strong ""Nos."" Some were just ""Nos."" And we have a couple that were mixed. But I just want to thank you folks. And we're going to have a great, great, healthcare plan. Thank you very much.END10:18 A.M.

370,2017-03-17,Remarks by President Trump in Roundtable Discussion on Vocational Training with U.S. and German Business Leaders ,"Cabinet Room12:58 P.M. EDTPRESIDENT TRUMP: Chancellor, thank you very much. Such a great honor to get to know you, to be with you. I want to thank all of the business leaders who have joined us to discuss a subject thats very important to me -- training our workforce for the 21st century, especially with respect to manufacturing jobs.Were working every day to bring back jobs to our country, and thousands and thousands are already coming back. Youre seeing it, youre reading about it in the papers every single day. We want to make sure that we have the workforce development programs we need to ensure these jobs are being filled by American workers.Germany and the United States have incredible opportunity to deepen our partnership as we continue to develop a strong workforce in both of our countries. Both Germany and the United States are pioneering job-training programs. Here in the United States, companies have created revolutionary high-tech and online courses. And, of course, for decades, Germany has been a model for highly successful apprenticeship -- thats a name I like, ""apprentice"" -- apprenticeship programs. As a result, Germanys youth unemployment rate is much lower than many of the other countries, especially the EU countries.I welcome collaboration between our two countries and our industry leaders. We have some of our great industry leaders here, as you know, Chancellor. Great people. We must embrace new and effective job-training approaches, including online courses, high school curriculums, and private-sector investment that prepare people for trade, manufacturing, technology, and other really well-paying jobs and careers. These kinds of options can be a positive alternative to a four-year degree. So many people go to college, four years, they dont like it, theyre not necessarily good at it, but theyre good at other things, like fixing engines and building things. I see it all the time, and Ive seen it -- when I went to school, I saw it. I sat next to people that werent necessarily good students but they could take an engine apart blindfolded.Companies across the country have a chance to develop vocational training programs that will meet their growing needs and to help us achieve greater prosperity. The German apprenticeship model is one of the proven programs to developing a highly skilled workforce. Germany has been amazing at this, and Im glad that the leaders of so many companies represented today have recently launched successful programs right here in the United States. And we need that because were training people as the jobs are pouring back in -- and they are coming back in big league. I believe that both countries will be stronger if we continue to deepen our bilateral cooperation on vocational training as we build off the best ideas, create the greatest opportunity for growth, and improve the lives of so many workers.I want to thank everybody in the room. I want to thank my daughter Ivanka, whos with us today. And mostly -- and most of all, I want to thank -- Chancellor, I want to thank you very much. Its a great honor to have you in the White House. Its a great honor to have you in the United States. And I look forward to spending time with you.Thank you.CHANCELLOR MERKEL: (Speaks German.)PRESIDENT TRUMP: Maybe before the press leaves Id like to ask some of the folks around -- the great leaders of industry and business to introduce themselves, say a couple of words. And then well get onto a little bit more private meeting, okay?Ginni.MS. ROMETTY: Okay. Im Ginni Rometty with IBM. And were going to talk about two programs. One is a certification program, which, Mr. President, today, were going to announce 2,000 veterans that were certifying in cybersecurity to be employed. And then the second is something called P-TECH, a public-private partnership. Think of it as a six-year high school, but the graduates come out with an associate degree and with a curriculum that business will hire. And we will have 100 schools by the end of the year. And youll meet one of our recent graduates. In a second, Janiel Richards will introduce herself and tell you about herself -- trained at the intersection of business and technology. PRESIDENT TRUMP: Great job. PARTICIPANT: Weve found that a lot of the private-sector companies have done a great job trying to train the workforce for the jobs that they need, the jobs of the future. In a lot of cases in America, were finding that we dont have enough qualified applicants for the jobs that we have available, so in working with the private sector -- and Ginni has been a great leader of that -- the White House has been trying to get behind a lot of these programs that can help make sure were training the American people for the jobs that were hopefully going to be producing in the future. SECRETARY ROSS: Our hope is that, today, we really come with a way forward, some specific programs where we can interact between the educational community, the business community, and the government. Because this is a monumental problem that needs a monumental solution. MS. RICHARDS: Thank you for the introduction. Good afternoon, all. Thank you for the opportunity to share my story. It is both an honor and a pleasure to be here today. As mentioned, my name is Janiel Richards. In am 19 years old, and I am from (inaudible). Enrolling in IBMs P-TECH school was the best decision for me personally and professionally. I did not fully realize the weight of the opportunity I was given; however, looking back, it was a life chance.P-TECH strengthened my confidence and provided me with mentors who helped me strive. I learned the importance of understanding computers, and gained new skills in both coding and programming. I graduated the program in four and a half years -- relatively early -- and I graduated with my high school diploma and associates degree in computer science, as well as internship experience at IBM.I learned that technology is omnipresent and opens endless doors. I am now a digital commerce design developer at IBM, where I use my skills to create website pages and checkout pages for the marketplace. Im also pursuing my bachelors degree at Early College. Without the support of P-TECH and IBM, I would not be where I am today. I believe that every student should be offered this chance. Thank you all.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Thats a great job. Thank you very much. Great job. Wow. Who wants to follow that? (Laughter.) MR. KAESER: Mr. President, Chancellor, Vice President, my name is Joe Kaeser, and I work for Siemens. It's a company which has been in this great country for more than 160 years. We produce revenues and services worth $24 billion ever year, and 60 manufacturing sites in all 50 states in the country.So thank you for what youre doing. (Inaudible) in that aspect we brought the apprenticeship to the country, which has, in the meantime, also (inaudible) Department of Labor, so we roll it out everywhere in the community. And I feel very honored today to be part of an initiative that brings not only the apprenticeship and the training for the current manufacturing into play, but also the next generation of manufacturing going forward so we combine the present and the future for our great America and great manufacturing.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Great job. Great company too, by the way. Great company. Marc.MR. BENIOFF: Well, thank you very much, Mr. President, I am delighted to be here, and great to see you and the Vice President as well.Salesforce, as you know, is the fastest-growing of the top five software companies in the world today, and were on a path to create 2 million jobs and add 200 GDP to the world economy through our platform. Our software, as you know, 90 percent is engineered here in the United States, and, as the Vice President knows, handmade in Indianapolis and in San Francisco, where Im from.And Ill tell you, as we have kind of created these jobs all over the world, I see a great opportunity right here in the United States to create apprenticeships. And wed love to encourage you to take a moonshot goal to create 5 million apprenticeships in the next five years. And I think the key is, is that we see all these great programs and all these great companies doing workforce development. But if we all came together, if we all unified and created a great program with your leadership, I think we could create this 5 million extra jobs in the U.S.And you know, our companies are some of the greatest universities in the world. We shape these employees, we train them, we educate them, we bring them in, and I think we can do this. I think this is really exciting.THE PRESIDENT: Well, congratulations, and youre going an incredible job. And nice to know you. And really, what youve done is just amazing. And lets do that, lets go for that 5 million. Okay? (Laughter.) Very good.Ivanka, go ahead. Say something.MS. TRUMP: Thank you. And welcome, Chancellor, and to the many U.S. and German CEOs who are here today to discuss vocational education and workforce development. I applaud my fathers commitment to creating millions of jobs, and specifically making sure that all Americans have the skills required and necessary to fill the jobs both of today and of the future.As many of us realize, ingenuity, creativity often comes from the determination of the private sector, so its great to have such great private sector leaders here to share their thoughts and best practices with us today. And thank you for being here.THE PRESIDENT: Klaus.MR. ROSENFELD: Mr. President, Madam Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Klaus Rosenfeld. I am the CEO of Schaeffler. Schaeffler is a global automotive and industrial supplier with more than $14 billion U.S. sales, around 87,000 people globally and 75 clients.

Thank you very much, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you, Klaus, very much.MR. KRGER: Thank you, Mr. President and Mr. Vice President. From my side, thank you for inviting us. Yeah, its a great pleasure for us, for me. I would like to explain why, at BMW, we call the United States of America our second home. Im proud to be here because we were -- nearly 25 years ago we were founding our biggest plant in the BMW Group network in South Carolina. We created 9,000 jobs, and we know that in the area around South Carolina, I know we created an additional 4 to 5 to 6, 7 jobs -- the 9,000 people we employ at BMW in South Carolina.We have invested heavily in the further education and training and vocational training. It was around about $200 million in the last five years, and I can commit that we will invest another $200 million into training in the next five years.We are proud, as we are the biggest net exporter of vehicles in the United States. We have an annual net (inaudible) of $10 billion -- exported from South Carolina. Seventy percent of our production is being exported. And Im proud to be here because we have one apprentice whos with us from -- we have two main programs at Spartanburg, a BMW Scholar Program, which was founded in 2011 and has around about 100 people in the program, and they graduate and create -- get a great job at BMW. We are very proud on the skillset -- we need them for maintenance jobs.And I would like to talk about as well employment of skilled veterans, which we are setting up with our dealers in the United States to have their highly qualified veterans working for BMW dealers in the future.THE PRESIDENT: Well, Ive seen your plant in South Carolina. It is incredible. And congratulations, thats really great. Thank you.MR. KRGER: Thank you. May I invite you for the 25th anniversary in June? (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: I know I shouldnt have said that. (Laughter.) You know what, if I can, I will do it.MR.KRGER: Thank you very much.THE PRESIDENT: I wish I could, but if I can Ill do it. Absolutely.MS. DAVIS: Mr. President, Madam Chancellor, ladies and gentlemen, my name is Marie Davis, and I work at Schaefflers Automotive and Industrial Plant in Cheraw, South Carolina. Cheraw is a small town with a population of 5,800, and is nicknamed The Prettiest Town in Dixie. It is a great honor for me to be here today along with my peers -- apprentice Chad Robinson with Siemens Gas Turbine Plant of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Maria Puckett with BMW, from BMW plant Spartanburg, South Carolina -- and to be able to share my experiences with you regarding the Schaeffler apprenticeship program. BMW and Siemens also have very similar programs.I joined the Air Force after high school and served for four years. After returning home, I applied to and was accepted into the Schaeffler apprenticeship program. This is a very unique three-year program of classroom and hands-on experience, completed in conjunction with Northeastern Technical College, which provided me with special skills for my career. As part of the program, I also received an associates degree in machine tool technology and a Department of Labor certificate as a certified journeyman apprentice. After completing my apprenticeship, I worked as a CNC operator, was then promoted to (inaudible) leader, and am now planned maintenance supervisor. I am very glad that such an apprenticeship program existed in Cheraw, which allowed me to start and build my career with Schaeffler. I hope that more companies will follow BMW, Siemens, and Schaeffler and offer apprenticeship programs to develop skills that will allow for more manufacturing in the United States.It is an incredible privilege to be invited here today. Thank you so much for listening to me.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Great job. Thank you. Very nice.I know this one. (Laughter.)MR. LIVERIS: Mr. President and Madame Chancellor, what an honor it is for me to be here. Im Andrew Liveris from Dow Chemical. I feel like Germany is our home, to match my BMW colleagues point about the U.S. being home. We have been in Germany, and in fact the Chancellors backyard of former Eastern Germany for a long time. And the Chancellor graced us with a visit to our apprenticeship program there which -- Mr. President, the two things I want to talk about today is in fact apprenticeship, and -- theres a book here that I can show which has DOW and Siemens name on it. And just to let you know that we are working already together as two collaborators across the Atlantic to actually scale up programs like the one that was mentioned by the young lady to my right. So I want to talk about that and how we can scale it up through this great leadership that youre showing. And I also want to talk about veterans and displaced workers, especially in places like Michigan, where we are based. We have community college work called Fast Start, which is taking displaced workers and reskilling them. When new tech meets industrial tech, as Madame Chancellor says, opportunity is there. But weve got to create it by scaling right. So I want to also talk about that.And my last comment is, a big thank you for lending us or giving us Ivanka and Jared. Theyve been a tremendous duo in making this program real in very short weeks. Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Mr. Vice President.VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: Thank you, Mr. President. Let me just express my appreciation, along with the President, for the participants in this important conversation. All the businesses that are gathered here from across the United States and across Germany are an inspiration, and the innovation that youre bringing to career and technical and vocational education and to apprenticeship.Im especially impressed, Mr. President, with Janiel, and I dont know that Ive seen a more inspiring debut at the Cabinet table than anyone. (Laughter.)Let me also express my appreciation to the Chancellor for suggesting that we bring together, across the Atlantic, business leaders who have really been breaking new ground in this area, for which Germany is so celebrated. Were grateful for your leadership and look forward to sharing ideas about how we can strengthen the workforce in both of our countries.And lastly, let me just thank the President. As a former governor from a great manufacturing state, I can tell you that one of our very first conversations was about the innovation that Indiana was bringing to career and technical and vocational education. I can assure you that the passion that you see at this table today by the President is authentic, and at his direction, were going to work as an administration to strengthen the opportunities from secondary education on forward to open the doors for more vocational education, more technical education, and more apprenticeships across the United States to the betterment of the people of this country. And we look forward to working with our international partners to drive greater opportunities for Americans. So thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much, Mike. Appreciate it.

372,2017-03-20,Joint Readout of Meeting Between President Donald J. Trump and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi,"Today, President Donald J. Trump welcomed Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to the Oval Office to reaffirm Americas support for Iraq and the Iraqi people in our shared fight against the terrorist group ISIS/Daesh. The United States and Iraq stand fully committed to a comprehensive partnership, rooted in mutual respect and grounded in the United States-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement, which provides a framework for political, economic, cultural, and security cooperation. President Trump was particularly honored that Prime Minister al-Abadi was one of the first foreign leaders he has hosted at the White House, a testament to the close bonds between the American and Iraqi people and the importance of the relationship between our governments.In todays meeting, President Trump and Prime Minister al-Abadi praised the unprecedented cooperation between the militaries of the United States and Iraq in the fight against ISIS/Daesh, including the campaign to liberate west Mosul. Although ISIS/Daesh remains a dangerous enemy, we are confident it will be defeated. As Iraqi forces consolidate gains against ISIS/Daesh, the two leaders agreed that the United States and Iraq will pursue a long-term partnership to decisively root out terrorism from Iraq and strengthen the Iraqi military and other key institutions. Together with our partners in the 68-member Global Coalition against ISIS/Daesh, the United States will continue training and support for Iraqi forces to bring about the terrorist groups decisive and enduring defeat and further build the capabilities of Iraqi forces. This security partnership is a vital component of the national security of both the United States and Iraq.Recognizing that terrorism cannot be defeated by military might alone, the two leaders also agreed to promote a broad-based political and economic partnership based in the Strategic Framework Agreement. In the months ahead, United States and Iraqi leaders will consult on steps to deepen commercial ties and promote investment, expand collaboration in the energy sector, and seek new opportunities for cultural and educational cooperation. As we seek to advance common interests and promote prosperity, the United States commends Prime Minister al-Abadis vision for building a prosperous and diversified economy in Iraq, capable of fulfilling the needs and aspirations of the Iraqi people. The United States strongly supports Iraqs partnership with the International Monetary Fund and, in concert with our G-7 partners, will continue to help Iraq stabilize Iraqs economy and achieve needed reforms. The United States also welcomes the Prime Ministers efforts to foster more inclusive and accountable governance in Iraq and to address the human suffering in the country created by the brutality of ISIS/Daesh.President Trump and Prime Minister al-Abadi agreed that it is essential that Iraq develop and maintain positive relations with regional partners, both to enhance stability in the Middle East and to help Iraq begin to rebuild from the ravages of the brutal occupation of ISIS/Daesh. The President commended Prime Minister al-Abadi on Iraqs efforts to foster more constructive ties with countries in the region, which have a vital role in helping Iraq become a force for stability in the Middle East. As the United States and Iraq stand together against terrorism in all its forms, we will not tolerate efforts by any country to destabilize Iraq or undermine Iraqs democratic institutions.The United States and Iraq remain unified in our commitment to a comprehensive and mutually beneficial partnership in the years ahead.",20905.86,-8.7599999999984,5901.53,0.5299999999997453,2373.47,-4.7800000000002
373,2017-03-20,Readout of the Vice President's Meeting with the House Pro-Life Caucus,"The Vice President today met with Chairman Chris Smith and members of the House Pro-Life Caucus to discuss the American Health Care Act and President Trump's commitment to repealing and replacing Obamacare with a health care system that actually works. The House legislation, which could be considered by the House of Representatives this week, includes protections against taxpayer funding being used for abortions. The National Right to Life Committee last week endorsed the American Health Care Act for 'restoring the longstanding principles of the Hyde Amendment with respect to federally funded health coverage.' At the conclusion of the meeting, Vice President Pence reaffirmed his and President Trump's ongoing commitment to protecting the lives of the unborn.The list of participants was as follows:Congressman Robert Aderholt Congressman Brian BabinCongresswoman Vicky HartzlerCongressman Trent FranksCongressman Pete OlsonCongressman Robert PittengerCongressman Keith RothfusCongressman Chris SmithCongressman Randy Weber",20905.86,-8.7599999999984,5901.53,0.5299999999997453,2373.47,-4.7800000000002
374,2017-03-20,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 3/20/2017","James S. Brady Briefing Room1:45 P.M. EDTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. As you all know, the President will be speaking this afternoon in Louisville, and we've got an event coming up, so I'll try to keep this relatively short to focus on -- let the President focus on his message for the day.In regard to the news of the day, this morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with Bill Gates, the co-chair and trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The President and Mr. Gates talked about their shared commitment to finding and stopping disease outbreaks around the world. The President particularly commended Mr. Gates for the Gates Foundation's work in global health and health security. Generous and innovative private philanthropy groups, like the Gates Foundation, are critical to our mission of finding the cures of tomorrow.Also this morning, the confirmation hearings in the Judiciary Committee began for the Presidents nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge NeilGorsuch. As the judge will continue to show throughout this process, he's eminently qualified for this position, with impeccable academic credentials, a brilliant legal mind, and a proven commitment to the Constitution.On Tuesday and Wednesday, JudgeGorsuchwill be questioned by each member of the panel. And on Thursday, we anticipate things to conclude with a panel of witnesses.The President was glad to see so many people convey their support in the last few days for JudgeGorsuch. Just this past weekend, SenatorGrassley, former New York Mayor Bloomberg, editorial boards from across the country, and several of his former colleagues and classmates either pennedop-edsand editorials or provided comments, one way or another, stating his impeccable qualifications for the bench.They add to the long list of jurists, politicians, and elected officials from both sides of the aisle who have already given the judge their support. The President looks forward to watching JudgeGorsuchcontinue to show the Senate what an extraordinary addition he will be to the bench, and is confident that he will be confirmed.Later in the morning, the President had a meeting with Speaker Ryan, Secretary of Health and Human Services Dr. Tom Price, and Dr. Zeke Emanuel. Dr. Emanuel has been intimately involved in crafting healthcare policy since his work onObamacare. Obviously, he and the President have some differing views on the best way to make healthcare affordable and accessible, but the President also strongly believes that the health and wellbeing of the American people shouldnt always be a partisan issue, and he will continue to reach across party lines and listen to voices on this issue.Last week he heard from individuals and families who have suffered from the disastrous results ofObamacare. Hes previously spoken to healthcare policy groups, Republican congressional leadership, and health insurance companies. This week, he and his staff will have discussions on women in healthcare while continuing an opendialoguewith members of Congress. And he will be hosting even more meetings and listening sessions in the coming weeks as he works with Congress to bring commonsense reforms to our healthcare system.The President has shown that he's willing to hear from all stakeholders in the healthcare field, and he will continue to listen as the process on the American Health Care Act moves along and we pursue the additional legislative and administrative actions necessary.This afternoon, the President had lunch with the Vice President, and as we speak he's meeting with Secretary of StateTillerson. The Secretary just returned from an important trip to Asia. He made it clear that America is committed to our allies, Japan and the Republic of Korea, and that we expect China to increase its role in persuading North Korea to move away from nuclear weapon and ballistic missile development and toward steps to create a better future for the North Korean people.This trip set the stage for future leader-level engagement between the U.S. and China. During this meeting, he will debrief the President on his trip.Later this afternoon, the President will welcome Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq. The Iraqi people have been a brave and steadfast partner in our shared fight against ISIS, al Qaeda, and radicalism. The President will speak with the Prime Minister about how that partnership will help us defeat ISIS and move into a new era in which Iraq is a force for stability and peace and a prosperous Middle East.After his bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister, the President will depart the White House for Louisville, Kentucky for a Make America Great Again Rally before returning to the White House later this evening.A few notes at the end before I take some questions.Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin returned from a very successful trip to Europe, where he stopped in the UK for a bilateral with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and later met with 18 of his counterparts during the G20 Ministerial in Baden-Baden. This trip gave the Secretary an opportunity to outline the administration's priorities on a number of issues, including macroeconomic policy, financial regulation, international tax, and illicit finance. During the meetings, the Secretary and his counterparts presented a platform that will strengthen our collective work on steps to promote global growth and financial stability.In terms of the schedule for the rest of the week -- tomorrow, the President will sign S. 442, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 in the morning, and make remarks at the National Republican Congressional Committee March Dinner in the evening.On Wednesday, as I mentioned last week, the President will meet with the Congressional Black Caucus.On Thursday, the President will hold an event with truck drivers and representatives from the trucking companies and industry on healthcare and its negative impacts on their industry and livelihood, which just happens to be the largest employer in 29 states.And on Friday, the President will hold a Greek Independence Day celebration. Well have further updates on all of those events later.And finally, I want to address the House Intelligence Committee hearing that is currently happening in which the FBI director and the NSA director are currently testifying and comment to the extent that I can at this time. This hearing, as Chairman Nunes noted, is the first of several that the House Intelligence Committee is engaged in, and the President is happy that theyre pursuing the facts in this. As has been previously reported, Director Comey confirmed that the FBI is investigating Russias role in interfering with the election. And let me just comment briefly on that.Following this testimony, its clear that nothing has changed. Senior Obama intelligence officials have gone on record to confirm that there is no evidence of a Trump-Russia collusion. The Obama CIA director said so, Obamas director of national intelligence said so, and we take them at their word.However, there was some new information that came from the hearing that we believe is newsworthy about the intelligence-gathering process and the unmasking of Americans identified in intelligence reports, and the illegal leak of such unmasked individuals, which is a federal crime. Director Comey told the House Intelligence Committee that certain political appointees in the Obama administration had access to the names of unmasked U.S. citizens, such as senior White House officials, senior Department of Justice officials, and senior intelligence officials. Before President Obama left office, Michael Flynn was unmasked and then illegally his identify was leaked out to media outlets, despite the fact that, as NSA Director Rogers said, that unmasking and revealing individuals endangers national security.""Not only was General Flynns identify made available, Director Comey refused to answer the question of whether or not hed actually briefed President Obama on his phone calls and activities. Director Comey called these types of disclosures of classified information a threat to national security, and said he will investigate and pursue these matters to the full extent of law. He also said that the leaking of classified information had become unusually active in the timeframe in question. Its also important to note that both Directors Comey and Rogers told the committee that they have no evidence that votes were changed in the swing states the President had won.I think that pretty much, until we get the ending of this hearing -- I dont know that I want to comment too much further. And with that, Id be glad to take a few questions.Jonathan.Q  Sean, does the President still have complete confidence in FBI Director Comey?MR. SPICER: Theres no reason to believe he doesnt at this time. John.Q  You said -- wait, hold on --MR. SPICER: I answered you.Q  He said that there is no information to support the allegations that the President made against President Obama.MR. SPICER: At this time.Q  So is the President prepared to withdraw that accusation and apologize to the President?MR. SPICER: No, we started a hearing. Its still ongoing. And, as Chairman Nunes mentioned, this is one in a series of hearings that will be happening. As I noted last week, theres also a lot of interesting news coming out of that in terms of the activities that have gone on to reveal the information on American citizens that have been part of this, particularly General Flynn. Theres a lot of things that arent being covered in this hearing that I think are interesting that -- since its ongoing, Ill leave that for now. But I think theres a lot of areas that still need to be covered. Theres a lot of information that still needs to be discussed.Q  The director also said hes investigating the links and the possibility of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Given that the President just this morning said that the Democrats made up the Russia story, why would the FBI director be investigating a story if its simply --MR. SPICER: I dont think thats what he said. But again, look at what --Q  No, no, he did. He said that hes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether or not there was any coordination.MR. SPICER: Correct. But again, investigating it and having proof of it are two different things. If you look at the acting Obama CIA director, he said that theres smoke but theres no fire. Senator Tom Cotton -- ""Not that Ive seen and not that Im aware of."" You look at Director Clapper -- Not to my knowledge. Senator Chris Coons, Democrat from Delaware -- I have no evidence of collusion.Theres a point at which you continue to search for something that everybody whos been briefed hasnt seen or found. I think its fine to look into it, but at the end of the day, theyre going to come to the same conclusion that everybody else has had. So you can continue to look for something, but continuing to look for something that doesnt exist doesnt matter.There is a discussion -- I heard some names thrown around before -- that were hangers-on or on the campaign, and I think at some point people that got thrown around at the beginning of this hearing, some of those names, the greatest amount of interaction that theyve had has had cease-and-desist letters sent to them. Q  Youre talking about the Roger Stones and the Carter Pages.MR. SPICER: Exactly, the Carter Pages, yes. But those people, the greatest amount of interaction that they had with the campaign was the campaign apparently sending them a series of cease-and-desist letters. So again, I think that when you read a lot of this activity about associates, there is a fine line between people who want to be part of something that they never had an official role in, and people who actually played a role in either the campaign or the transition.Julie.Q  Sean, I just had two quick questions on the hearing today. Does the President -- now that we know there is an ongoing investigation by the FBI -- does the President stand by his comments that he is not aware of any contacts that his campaign associates had with Russia during the election?MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  And then the second one is: Has anyone from the White House --MR. SPICER: Well, can I just amend the first one?Q  Sure.MR. SPICER: Obviously, just to be clear, I know that -- Im trying to think through this for a second, because obviously General Flynn -- but again --Q  Right, particularly during the campaign, before the election. MR. SPICER: Right. And Im not aware of any at this time. But even General Flynn was a volunteer of the campaign, and then obviously theres been discussion of Paul Manafort who played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time. But beyond --Q  He was the chairman of the campaign --MR. SPICER: Hey, Jonathan, hold on. Can you stop interrupting other peoples questions?Q  (Inaudible) played a limited role --MR. SPICER: Hey, Jonathan, somebody is asking a question. Its not your press briefing. Julie is asking a question. Please calm down. Julie.Q  Are you saying then that the President is aware of contacts that Manafort had during the campaign?MR. SPICER: No, no, nothing that hasnt been previously discussed. I just dont want to make it look like were not aware of the stuff thats --Q  Understood. And then the second thing is, anyone from the White House, up to the President, been interviewed by the FBI as part of this investigation?MR. SPICER: Not that Im aware of. Mara.Q  You said that -- you made a point of saying that Comey refused to say whether he had briefed Obama about the investigation. And also, the President, on his official account, tweeted the same thing today. Comey made a point today of saying, please do not draw any conclusions from my ability to confirm or deny anything, but you are drawing a conclusion from that.MR. SPICER: Well, I think were pointing it out. I mean, were making a point that it is not known. And I think theres further -- I mean, to everyone who was looking for a conclusion today, I think theres a lot more that needs to be discussed and looked at before we can jump to a conclusion about --Q  (Inaudible.)MR. SPICER: Hold on. But I think the point is, is that, in the same token youve got individuals that want an answer, and at the same time, theres clearly a lot of information that still hasnt come out or been discussed.Q  So youre looking forward to this investigation --MR. SPICER: I think that we are -- there is a lot more to come is the answer that I --Q  But the reason that Im asking this question is you said that they are going to come to the same conclusion of everybody else.MR. SPICER: My point is, is that --Q  So you already know what the conclusion is?MR. SPICER: No, no, no. What Im getting at is that there is this continuous -- there is this media narrative that continues to talk about collusion that exists, and yet every person that's been briefed -- Nunes; Tom Cotton; Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware; Clapper, the Obama appointee -- have all said that nothing that they've seen makes them believe that there was any collusion. And I think theres a difference between talking about an investigation into the 2016 election, which we all know, and any evidence of collusion. There is no evidence, according to the people that have been briefed, of any collusion or activity that leads them to believe that that exists. I think that is an important point that gets overlooked over and over and over again. Q  Right, but you said its fine to look into it, but they are going to come to the same conclusion of everybody else -- that this collusion doesnt exist. So you already know --MR. SPICER: No, I dont. What Im --Q  -- investigation is finished --MR. SPICER: No, no, thats not what Im saying. What Im saying is, is that every single person -- because what the director said today is that there's an ongoing investigation. My point is to say that everybody who's been briefed on that investigation -- it doesnt -- there is an assumption that because there is an investigation, it must mean that its about something. My point to you is that there is an assumption on behalf of most people in the media about what that investigation must mean. And my point to you is, is that, despite the narrative that gets played over and over again with respect to what the investigation might mean in terms of collusion, every person, Republican and Democrat, that has been briefed on it has come to the same conclusion that there is no collusion and that thats over. So while we can talk about an investigation, big-picture holistically, the idea that so many people are trying to jump to a conclusion seems very, very misguided.Zeke.Q  Thanks, Sean. Two quick ones. First -- briefing with the President, do you expect the invitation to President Xi to that summit that's being reported on for next month to be -- was that extended on that trip? And do you expect that to be taking place early April, the 6th, 7th and 8th?MR. SPICER: Ill try to have more of a readout afterwards. I know that theyre going to talk extensively about what he accomplished in both Japan, South Korea, and obviously in Beijing. But Im going to let the Secretary of State debrief the President before I get ahead of deciding what was discussed in Beijing.Q  And back to the previous topic. I was hoping you could square the circle a little bit. You said in the case of the Presidents tweets, on this an ongoing investigation, that more things will come out that may justify that. But in the case of the Clinton charges, you listed all the people who have said (inaudible) investigation there. Why, in one case, is that sufficient to say that there is no -- you could rule out collusion now, versus in the other case you'd say, oh, there is going to be more information coming out that will prove these tweets?MR. SPICER: Well, Im not -- because again, I think theres a difference. Im not ruling anything out. Im merely explaining to you that every person -- Republican, Democrat, Obama, that served in the Obama administration across a broad section --Q  You can say the same thing about tweets. MR. SPICER: In terms of what?Q  Wiretappings. MR. SPICER: But I think that there is -- on the investigation itself, we know from the people who have been briefed. On the other piece of it, we know that there is -- its an ongoing thing, and that even according to the Department of Justice in terms of the information that has been provided and Chairman Nunes, that they are still at the beginning of this process. That is a very different thing than a group of people saying there is an ongoing investigation. And from what weve been briefed, there is no evidence to suggest any type of collusion. Thats the difference.Hunter.Q  Thanks, Sean. On a slightly different topic: In his first eight weeks in office, President Trump has made at least 10 trips to the golf course. He regularly used to criticize President Obama for spending time on the course. How is his golf game any different?MR. SPICER: Well, I think two things. One is, you saw him utilize this as an opportunity with Prime Minister Abe to help foster deeper relationships in Southeast Asia -- in Asia, rather -- and have a growing relationship that's going to help U.S. interests. How you use the game of golf is something that he has talked about.Secondly, we went down to -- he had a mini Cabinet meeting the other day down -- or two weekends ago, down at his club in Virginia. And I remember so many people jumping to the conclusion that hes going down and playing golf. Just because you go somewhere doesnt necessarily mean that you did that. So on a couple of occasions, hes actually conducted meetings there, he's actually had phone calls. So just because he heads there doesnt mean that that's what's happening.Q  I know he did meet with Prime Minister Abe on the course, but we're not getting a lot of details on other high-level meetings that are taking place. If he is having these productive meetings on the course, why isnt the President and his aides being a little more forthcoming about what he's doing?MR. SPICER: It's the same reason that he can have dinner or lunch with somebody and not -- because I think the President is entitled to a bit of privacy at some point, which is what we've always agreed to. We bring the protective pool to be there, but the President is also entitled to a bit of privacy as well.Trey.Q  Does the President believe the FBI will do a fair job of investigating any sort of links to Russia during the election? And then I have one more for you.MR. SPICER: Well, I think there's a variety of institutions looking at it -- both the House and the Senate Intelligence Committee, the FBI. But, yeah, I think that when you get to the bottom of it, we'll have a much better picture of what's happening, and I think it will continue to vindicate him on that.Go ahead.Q  In a follow-up, the President tweeted this morning a question about a potential DNC connection to Russia during the election. Is he under the impression that the Clinton campaign had inappropriate contact with Russia during the election?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that -- and that's an interesting aspect of all of this that's not being covered. Number one, from everything that's been publicly available, on several occasions the DNC was asked by the FBI to investigate -- or to allow their servers to be looked at, despite all of the claims of their concerns about leaking. And yet, the question still doesnt come out -- why wouldnt the DNC, on multiple occasions, rebuff the FBI? Why were they not wanting -- if they were so concerned about hacks and leaking, why did the DNC not ask the FBI to come look? Not only did they not ask them; they rebuffed them on multiple occasions. Why? What are they hiding? What were they concerned of?But I think there is a serious question. I mean, it's not -- they're very clear about the concerns they have, as well as all of the leadership in the Democratic Party. And yet when it came to hacks and leaks out of the DNC -- and they're quick to jump to the conclusion about who did it, and yet they wouldnt allow the FBI to investigate it -- there's a whole second set of concerns here in terms of what was Hillary Clinton's role. I mean, if you look at the Obama administration and the Clintons' involvement with Russia in terms of donations the Clintons received from Russia and entities, the idea that they sold off a tremendous amount of the uranium to the Russian government, and yet where was the concern for that? What are we doing to look into that? It was the Obama administration in 2009 that talked about a reset with Russia and a desire to reset relationships. It was Hillary Clinton who signed off on the deal that gave a Russian company one-fifth of the U.S. uranium supply. Where is the questioning about that? What did they get?There was discussion the other day about a Russian official noting that both campaigns they sought to -- where is the concern about their efforts on the Hillary Clinton thing? The Democrats and the Democratic Party, and a lot of those individuals are quick to point fingers, and yet when it comes to discussing their own collusion or questions involving their involvement with Russian officials or buy-offs to the Russians, there's no discussion there. So you got to wonder, on both sides, where's the parity when it comes to these kinds of investigations?Margaret.Q  Sean, what constitutes conclusive evidence for the President on this front when you say there's more to come forward? You've got the FBI director saying nothing to back up the President's tweets about wiretapping, the former head of the DNI, House Intelligence Committees. I mean, you've had a series of officials. So when does this end for the President? Is it March 28th?MR. SPICER: It's not a question of a date, it's a question of where we get answers. If you look at someone like Michael Flynn and you ask the question, how does an American citizen, who should be protected by law from having their identity unmasked, how does that happen? Because you got to think about it just like this: The FBI and all the relevant intelligence agencies have access to this document; they can figure out who it was. Right? So --Q  I'm sorry -- who it was?MR. SPICER: Hold on. In other words, they --Q  The wiretapping of the President, that's the claim.MR. SPICER: Listen. I understand that. What I'm getting at is that there's a lot of information that we have come to learn about what happened in terms of surveillance throughout the 2016 election and the transition. And when you look at somebody like Michael Flynn and you realize that while they might have been looking at somebody else at that time, how does somebody's name that's protected by law from being disclosed get put out in the public? Why was it put out in the public? Because the people in the intelligence community would have had access to that information. They could have found out who it was. But yet you've got to question why was a name that should have been protected by law from being put out into the public domain put out there? What were the motives behind that? What else do we need to know? Who was behind that kind of unmasking?Q  So are you saying the President has evidence that we have yet to see in public?MR. SPICER: No, no, I am saying that there's a lot more questions that need to get asked about what was being done in terms of surveillance, who was being surveilled, why were they being involved, what techniques -- why are certain people being sort of ""unmasked"" and having their identity known, what was going on. But there's a lot more questions than answers that need to get asked.Q  Who does the President trust to provide those answers if not the heads of all those agencies?MR. SPICER: And we've talked about this ad nauseam, that the House and the Senate Intelligence Committees are looking into this. Today is the first of several hearings that Chairman Nunes intends to call. Senator Burr has already talked about it. There's a ways to go. And I get that you guys want to know the end of the book right now, but we're on the first chapter of this process.Steve.Q  So Burr and Nunes, he does trust them to provide --MR. SPICER: Of course. We've put out a statement saying so much that we asked them to look into it. So I dont think it should come to any surprise that that's where we have noted multiple times that that's where the President believe the appropriate place and the process for all of these documents to go through.Steve.Q  The President said he had a lot of meetings over the weekend on North Korea. Who were those meetings with? And what was his reaction to North Korea's test of this new rocket engine?MR. SPICER: Well, I think we continue to be concerned with North Korea's activity. That's why not only have we continued to have conversations with officials in Japan and South Korea, but we continue to urge China to step in and play a larger role in deterring both the ballistic and other missile threats that North Korea plays. I will try to have a further readout on some of those conversations, but I think there is growing concern about North Korea. I think that is part of what SecretaryTillersonis going to be discussing to him during their meeting.Q  And didTillersonget a promise from China to weigh in more on North Korea?MR. SPICER: I think he sent a very clear signal that our policy of strategic patience is over. The President and the Secretary of State have an expectation that China employed multiple points of pressure on North Korea. We know that we dont agree 100 percent of the time with China, but as the State Department noted yesterday, both President Xi and SecretaryTillersonagreed that there are opportunities for greater cooperation between China and the United States, and acknowledged that there are and will be in the future differences between the two countries. But I think that Secretary Tillerson's trip continued to -- or helped set us down that path. And I think that the follow-on meetings that the leaders intend to have will be helpful in that vein.Q  Given the talk last week about the budget, the priorities for the American tax dollars, the need to cut programs like -- or make cuts to programs like Meals on Wheels, is the President going to consider curbing some of his trips to Mar-a-Lago that the GAO estimates could cost $3 million for the President to Palm Beach? Is he planning to cut those back at all given his feelings about the priorities for the Americans' tax dollars?MR. SPICER: I think that is a vast reach to suggest -- I mean, Presidents always travel. And I think the President, wherever he goes, he carries the apparatus of the White House with us. That is just something that happens. The President will continue to go and travel around the country and have meetings to solve the nation's problems.And again, I think just -- because I know you took a little bit of a shot there, I think even The Washington Post, which is no friend to conservatives, even they sided with us that these false sort of narratives on Meals on Wheels -- its not a federal program. Three percent of their total budget comes from a block grant thats passed through there. Its a state-run program. They had apparently a phenomenal weekend this week.I get that thats a cute program to point at, but it's false and misleading to try to make that narrative stick.Q  So to your point that all Presidents travel, no President has traveled so often and so early to their own private residence. MR. SPICER: President Bush went to Crawford.Q  Not this often and --MR. SPICER: I get it, I get it. But at the same time, the President is -- very clearly that hes worked seven days a week. This is where he goes to see his family. He brings people down there. This is part of being President.John.Q  Thank you, Sean. Turning back to the meeting with Chancellor Merkel on Friday, did the President and the Chancellor discuss the economic crisis in Greece at all? And given the appointment of two officials to the Treasury Department who have been critical of the International Monetary Fund, does the administration see a new or different role for the IMF in resolving the Greek economic crisis?MR. SPICER: Let me refer you to the Treasury Department on IMF. I think the readout that we provided on the Secretarys -- on the Chancellors visit, rather -- excuse me -- speaks for itself. They spoke at length as far as what they discussed and what they meant. So Im not going to step on that.Francesca.Q  Thank you. Are you aware of any White House officials that are under investigation by the FBI?MR. SPICER: No.Q  Okay. And you mentioned the hangers-on in the campaign earlier and Carter Page, but there was also a question about Roger Stone. Was he also in that category? Is he someone that the President is still in frequent contact with? Because hes often called an informal advisor to the President and a confidante of his. MR. SPICER: Mr. Stone is somebody the President has known for a long time. He worked briefly on the campaign I think until about August of 2015, from recollection. They have talked from time to time but I dont think any time recently. But they had a long relationship going back years where he would provide counsel. And again, he played a role early on in his campaign but ended that role in August of 2015. And I dont know at all when the last time they even spoke was.Q  Sean, in the meeting this morning with Gates, did the Presidents cut in NIH funding come up? And how does he square meeting with Gates and sort of focusing on this whole need to continue medical research and then at the same time want to cut medical research funding by such a large amount?MR. SPICER: I know they talked about cures and health, and I think he applauds a lot of the work that theyve done overseas in particular. I dont have a full readout on it yet, but Ill try to get you more on it.Look, weve discussed the NIH in particular. I think that theres this assumption in Washington that if you dont spend more on a subject that youre not caring as much. When you look at some of the agencies and departments and programs that weve seen, in many cases theyre not meeting their mission. And I think there are cost-savings that can be achieved so that you can focus the dollars that are being allocated towards a more effective use of the mission at hand.But its interesting, only in Washington do you literally judge the success of something by how much money you throw at the problem, not actually whether its solving the problem or coming up with anything. April.Q  Sean, I want to go to a couple of topics. One, back on wiretapping, Comey said he had no information supporting that President Obama wiretapped President Trump. So with that, you have Schiff saying things like there are half-truths coming from this President; no truth, its dangerous; were alienating our allies; we need to be able to trust our President. And with that, Im going to ask you -- and I need an answer for this -- how do you regain trust, as some view him as the boy who cried wolf?MR. SPICER: I think if youre citing Adam Schiffs political diatribe at the beginning as some sort of sense of -- he literally went off --Q  But you have Comey saying --MR. SPICER: Hold on. If you want to talk about a series of mistruths and misdirection, I think if you look at that opening statement it was filled with those. So I dont need to use that as some basis for having to respond to you. I was watching a lot of the reporter response on Twitter initially to his sort of diatribe, and I think there were several folks that talked about how hes mischaracterizing and taking things way out of context. So to use that as the basis of some kind of authoritative --Q  What about Comey saying there is no information? How do you regain the trust at that --MR. SPICER: April, Ive addressed this multiple times. At this point, we are at the beginning phases of this and we have a ways to go.John.Q  Wait, Im not finished. I asked on the budget. On the budget. How -- and this is kind of going back to --MR. SPICER: This is number three now.Q  Not really; its number two. Thank you. How is the President contributing to his own role of reducing spending, the deficit and the debt, and his management of spending here at the White House?MR. SPICER: Theres a lot -- weve used -- the White House, when it looks at a total percentage of the budget, is miniscule. I think that to ask that question is somewhat ironic after seeing Director Mulvaney sit up here the other day and talk about the savings and the cost-cutting measures that weve seen across the entire budget. He sat up here and got grilled on that and answered effectively how the President is looking at efficiencies and duplicity in all programs throughout government. So its not just a question of here at the White House, but hes looking at it holistically throughout all of government. But then you look at some of the activities the President is personally engaged in terms of the F-35, the next generation of Air Force One, personally getting -- and looking at ways in which we can create a more effective and efficient procurement process. Thats one area where I think youre going to see the President personally engage on more and more, is looking at all the stuff that the government buys and how were doing it, our bidding process in so many ways, especially in the Department of Defense.Q  What about salaries? We know three people here are not taking salaries. But what about salaries? Im talking about since hes making these massive cuts, is the hurt going to come here as well?MR. SPICER: Sure. Its not just a hurt, but you bring it up -- there are multiple people here who are not taking salaries. I mean, that is --Q  Three,MR. SPICER: Huh?Q  Three. MR. SPICER: No, way more than three, April.Q  How many?MR. SPICER: Ill get back to you, but there are several individuals that are not taking a salary here. So when you talk about commitment to helping to come serve this government, serve the President and actually help institute a vision, theres a lot of people who have sacrificed tremendously in terms of saying, Ill give up -- Ive done very well for myself, this country has benefitted me, this is an opportunity for me to give back -- that there are people well through this organization who have done that.John.Q  The President met with Dr. Emanuel, as you pointed out, a short time ago. Hes probably one of the fiercest critics of what the President is trying to do of anybody out there. Hes made it quite clear that he believes that this will take us back to worse than we were before the Affordable Care Act came in. What did the President hope to gain by meeting with Dr. Emanuel today?MR. SPICER: Well, hes an architect ofObamacare. I think that despite our political and policy differences, he wants to hear ideas not just of him but a lot of people. Weve brought in people on both sides of the aisle from both houses, from industry. The idea is to try to make this the best possible -- he talked to Elijah Cummings a couple weeks ago about drug prices. Its not about ideology or party, its about instituting a patient-centric drug and healthcare system that benefits the American people and gives them the access and the price point that they can get healthcare and actually get coverage. So it is hearing his ideas. Its listening to his suggestions and figuring out if we can make it better. Part of the manager's amendment that Speaker Ryan talked about is in large part because weve been listening and making it better and making it better. And as it continues to work its will through the process, its not just the current bill but its also the additional legislation thats part of this overall three-pronged process that weve talked about. So making sure that we do this right and we give the American people the best possible outcome is what this has always been about.Q  The Speaker wants to get this in front of the House maybe by Thursday. How much will the plan change between now and then compared to what we saw voted on in the first two committees?MR. SPICER: Three. The House Ways and Means Committee --Q  And is the President going up to the Hill tomorrow morning?MR. SPICER: We dont have any announcements on the schedule at this time. Hes going to continue to make sure that we do everything we can, and Ill leave the legislative piece up to Speaker Ryan.Q  How much does he think is going to change between what we saw voted on by Ways and Means --MR. SPICER: It depends on how much -- look, I think Speaker Ryan detailed some additions and ideas and suggestions on your network yesterday with Chris Wallace that he is considering, and I think as we continue to meet with folks -- there are some staff-level discussions that occurred over the weekend. There will be more later this afternoon. And to the extent that we can make changes that I think enable us to maintain 218 votes, we will do it.Sara.Q  Thanks, Sean. There are a number of the Presidents supporters on the Hill and elsewhere who worry that the Presidents refusal to drop the whole wiretapping issue will eclipse some of his other accomplishments. What message does the President have for his supporters who worry that this could be a rabbit hole that might diminish the other things hes trying to, like healthcare?MR. SPICER: I think there will be a lot of accomplishments, so they dont need to worry. Weve got a lot of things coming down the pike, and I think whether its healthcare, tax reform, his infrastructure plan, reforming government, immigration -- I think were going to have a lot of things to be very proud of that people on both sides of the aisle are going to be excited to see enacted. And so in due time there will be plenty to be proud of. Sara.Q  You dismiss Paul Manafort as sort of an incidental figure in this campaign. But he worked for the campaign for five months, he was the campaign chairman, he was there for a number of pivotal decisions. So Im wondering how is that insignificant, and is the White House aware of any contacts between Paul Manafort and Russian operatives or suspected Russian operatives? And is that cause for concern?MR. SPICER: Well, just so were clear: Im not dismissing Paul Manafort as a hanger-on, I was noting to some other folks, as Jonathan pointed out. With respect to Paul, though, I believe -- and again, Im not looking to re-litigate the election or -- but I believe Paul was brought on sometime in June, and by the middle of August he was no longer with the campaign, meaning that for the entire final stretch of the general election, he was not involved. And so to start to look at some individual that was there for a short period of time, or, separately, individuals who really didnt play any role in the campaign, and to suggest that those are the basis for anything is a bit ridiculous.Q  So are you saying it wouldnt be cause for concern if we found out that Paul Manafort was in contact with Russian operatives or suspected operatives when he was the campaign chairman?MR. SPICER: No, no, no, I think that -- but to intimate that somebody who was there for eight weeks, and definitely not there in the final three months of the campaign played some kind of lasting role that influenced -- you know, again, you realize, I think somewhere between March -- I mean, August 12th or the 15th was when he ended his affiliation with the campaign.So my point is, to suggest now that if you look at the final three months of the campaign where none of the individuals in question that Democrats brought up over and over again today were affiliated with the campaign -- to suggest that that somehow shows some high-level collusion is a bit of a stretch to say the least.Q  And is the White House aware of any contacts between Paul Manafort and Russian operatives or suspected Russian operatives?MR. SPICER: No.Q  He joined in March. Sean, youve been really critical of reports that are based on sources in the past. Today it seems like the two headlines that we got out of the committee were, one, an official confirmation directly from the FBI and the Justice Department that there is an ongoing criminal investigation into whether associates of the sitting President had contacts with Russia and Russian operatives, and whether there was any coordination between those. And the second headline being that there is an official -- you had questioned in the past, Priebus a couple weeks ago, when there were reports in our paper and others that the FBI director was indicating that there was no support for Presidents tweets, you said, well, those are just reports; those are not coming from his mouth -- he hasnt said it. Okay, weve now got it from his mouth directly, in open testimony, that there is no evidence that he has to support the Presidents tweets. I guess the question is, do those two facts, which are now on the record and not attributed to anonymous sourcing -- does that cause this White House any concern? And how come you treat the one -- the latter, the one about wiretapping -- you want to say thats just in the early stages, but on the former one, you want to sort of come to the conclusion that the investigation has sort of gotten to the point where you dont have to worry about that because thats all said and done and everybody has come to the conclusion on that? So that seems like youre treating both of those pieces of news very differently.MR. SPICER: Well, first, I think your headlines are bad. Im glad to rewrite --Q  I dont think that. MR. SPICER: Id be glad to if you guys are looking for some help. (Laughter.) Q  Are you looking for a job?MR. SPICER: Our services are at the New York Times disposal if it comes to writing headlines, and we could probably do a couple things on stories too, if youre willing to go there.I think because theres a big difference. One is, literally talking -- theres a big difference. Everyone keeps conflating that there is an investigation into the 2016 election. Got it -- no disagreement there. Right? But I think that theres a question about collusion between anybody. And my point has been to say over and over again, to the dismay of every one of you guys, is that when the people who have been briefed by the FBI about collusion between individuals, the answer continues to be no. And at some point, take no for an answer. When these people, both sides of the aisle -- Obama appointees, elected Democrats, elected Republicans -- say ""no evidence suggested,"" at some point it's not just about me, it's about you: Take no for an answer. And realize that the people -- while you can have an investigation, it doesnt necessarily mean that you have to jump to the conclusion that, ah ha, it must be about the collusion between those two things.They've talked about this for a long time. The 17 intelligence agencies have talked about an ongoing investigation into Russia's involvement in the election. That's vastly different than jumping to the conclusion and saying that there must be somehow, therefore, a collusion between individuals on one side. They dont talk about all of the Hillary Clinton collusion that may or may not have occurred, and that was a subject that came up with a Russian official, and yet that has not gotten pursued once.There were zero minutes paid on the evening news the other night, when that Russian official said that they had attempted to reach out to both campaigns. Zero minutes. I know, I know -- see, I'm an equal opportunity --Q  But can I just ask, does the President need to take no for an answer in the same way that you're urging the news media to on this?MR. SPICER: No, because one is a bunch of people who have been briefed who are saying, we havent seen anything. And one is an ongoing -- because, again, when you ask them, they are getting at -- the President was very clear, and I think there is continuing to be a very, very literal interpretation of his tweet, which is whether or not there was wiretapping. The President understands that you dont literally wiretap people the same way that you did in the '70s and '80s with wires and things in the phone. Q  Director Comey didnt focus on wiretapping. He focused on the question of surveillance. MR. SPICER: No, but again, I think that we are still at the beginning phase of a look as to what kind of surveillance occurred and why, and that there's a question about what leaks occurred, why they're happening. And again, just Director Comey -- because I believe one of the big headlines that should come out of today is that when he talks about the unusually high amount of leaks that are coming out of this, and classified information leaks, that in itself should be a question: Why is so much information being leaked out now? What are the motives behind it? Who is doing it? And is it threatening our national security? Which I do believe the answer is yes. But there's a lot of other stories.And that's why I think, with all due respect to your two headlines coming out, I do believe there's a lot of headlines coming out. It's just that the only headlines that people want to write are the ones that support a narrative against this administration, and not one that actually looks into how many times do people say that there was no evidence of something happening; how many times -- or how much classified information is being leaked. There's a lot of headlines that should be written today about a lot of stuff that's ongoing. And I know that we have an ongoing hearing, but there's a lot of other things that need to get discussed and arent being happening. Why did the DNC not let the FBI look at their servers? Why is that story not -- because I would assume that if somebody was a victim of something, which they have yelled from the rooftops --Q  And you --Q  The President made the allegation. MR. SPICER: Hold on, hold on --Q  I'm sorry, I'm curious -- the implication of that is what?MR. SPICER: No, no, the question is, why is none of that being looked at?Q  I understand the question. But --MR. SPICER: I dont know what the -- but my point is, is that, not to draw an implication, but to merely ask a question, which all I'm getting at is that suddenly none of the questions regarding any of this seemed to get asked or answered or explored. And yet --Q  But you won. You're here. MR. SPICER: Brian, you get the same treatment that Jonathan does. That doesnt mean you get to jump in. So the answer that I'm getting at is, why are none of those questions being asked? Why is no one taking no for an answer when it comes to all of these individuals saying that they've seen nothing? But there are a series of headlines that I would suggest need to get written and, frankly, stories. I'm glad to do that, as I offered.George.Q  I'd like to try to clarify two things. In the future, when you, from that podium, read from news articles or cite news articles, can we assume that you're vouching for the accuracy of those articles?MR. SPICER: I think merely reading a story that's in a paper is not vouching for it, it's reading the story.Q  It doesnt put a White House --MR. SPICER: No. I think reading a series of things when asked a question, ""where is this narrative coming from,"" and citing a multitude of stories that are in the public domain is not necessarily endorsing everything I read. That's a silly assertion. We're reading stories that you and your colleagues -- and not necessarily you at National Journal -- have put out, but several people in here whose publication have put something out. Simply reciting those things is not an endorsement.Q  The second thing is, when you talked to the British about the GCHQ thing, did you tell them that the White House would not raise that again? Or can you talk about that conversation?MR. SPICER: There was merely an explanation of what we did and why we did it, which is what I just said to you. And that was it -- simply that. Thank you, guys, for that. We'll see you tomorrow. Hopefully some of you get a chance to go down today. If you don't, we'll have a readout. Thank you.END2:30 P.M.

One of the things I did ask is why did President Obama sign that agreement with Iran, because nobody has been able to figure that one out. But maybe someday well be able to figure it out.I want to thank you very much for being here, great respect for you. I know you're working very hard, and General Mattis and General McMaster and Rex Tillerson have all been telling me that you're doing a job -- its not an easy job, its a very tough job. Your soldiers are fighting hard. I know Mosul is moving along, but Mosul was ours until we left. So perhaps we shouldnt have gone in, and certainly we shouldnt have left. We should never ever have left, and the vacuum was created, and we discussed what happened. But well spend a lot of time with you, with your group. And thank you all very much for being here. We appreciate it. And we will figure something out. Our main thrust is we have to get rid of ISIS. We're going to get rid of ISIS. It will happen. Its happening right now.

Trump signed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Transition Authorization Act of 2017, the first comprehensive NASA authorization passed by Congress in more than six years. The bill demonstrates strong bipartisan support for our Nations space program and helps ensure that NASA remains at the forefront of exploration and discovery.With this legislation, we support NASAs scientists, engineers, astronauts and their pursuit of discovery, said President Trump during a signing ceremony at the White House. Americas space program has been a blessing to our people and to the entire world. Almost half a century ago, our brave astronauts first planted the American flag on the moon. That was a big moment in our history. Now this nation is ready to be the first in space once again. Today were taking the initial steps toward a bold and brave new future for American space flight.The Act, passed unanimously by Congress, authorizes the development and execution of a long-range plan for deep space human exploration; invests in robust science, technology and aeronautics portfolios; and endorses the Agencys successful efforts to nurture a new commercial market that will boost our economy and create more jobs. Additionally, it guarantees vastly improved health care for the heroes who risk their lives in the exploration of space.Attendees of the White House signing ceremony with the President included:Vice President Mike PenceActing NASA Administrator Robert LightfootActing NASA Deputy Administrator Lesa B.

383,2017-03-21,Daily Press Briefing by the Press Secretary - #25,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:56 P.M. EDTMR. SPICER: Hi, guys. The hearing is still -- Judge Gorsuchs hearing is ongoing, and considering the significant attention, I'm going to try to keep this a little on the shorter side today.The President is making a full day of progress towards some of his biggest promises that hes made to the American people. This morning he met with the House Republican Conference members on Capitol Hill, ahead of the Houses scheduled vote on the American Health Care Act, which is currently scheduled for Thursday.During the meeting, the President reminded members of the House Conference that repealing and replacing Obamacare has been a promise that Republicans have been making to voters for years.Members have made it clear that if voters put a Republican in the White House and continue Republican majorities in the House and the Senate that we would repeal and replace this ill-advised legislation.And for every member who pledged to the American people that they would deliver on this promise, this is really their chance. This is the repeal of Obamacare that Republicans have been working on for years, and voters have been waiting for this for some time.On Thursday, as the House gathers on the floor and casts their votes for the ACH, it will be exactly seven years after President Obama had signed Obamacare into law. Were hoping to make this the last anniversary Americans will have to endure Obamacare. Republicans have been working to repeal and replace this misguided law ever since. And now, under President Trump, we will finally be able to take this step towards fundamental reform of our healthcare system.I think most Americans remember the lines that were used to sell Obamacare seven years ago: If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your healthcare plan, youll be able to keep your healthcare plan. But for millions of Americans, those lines proved to be nothing more than empty promises. Plans that their families had relied on for years were suddenly cancelled. Premiums and deductibles skyrocketed, leaving many who had plans unable to actually use them. And insurers fled the marketplace. Nearly one in five Americans only have one insurer offering plans on their Obamacare exchange.President Trump and Republicans in Congress will keep their promise by reforming the system once and for all. And thats exactly what were doing with the American Health Care Act, which, along with the additional legislative and administrative action that is part of the three-prong approach that we continue to outline, will finally give all Americans the healthcare system they deserve, where market-based competition leads to more affordable, higher-quality care opportunities.This is an ongoing process, and the President has made it clear to Congress that they should be open to incorporating some of the common-sense policy proposals that have been suggested by members in both chambers who share their commitment to improving the healthcare system. To that end, the House introduced several technical and policy amendments to the legislation last night, which the President acknowledged on Capitol Hill this morning.They include: Delivering more immediate relief from Obamacares taxes, accelerating the repeal of these taxes from 2017 rather than from 2018, and ensuring that millions of Americans who paid Obamacares penalties or taxes can reclaim their hard-earned dollars from the IRS.It's making it easier for Americans to deduct more of the costs of their medical expenses. Protecting life by prohibiting taxpayer dollars from being used to help purchase insurance plans that currently cover abortion.Giving states additional flexibility for their Medicaid program covering traditional adult and children populations, while maintaining baseline funding for elderly and disabled populations.Giving states the ability to implement optional, reasonable work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents as part of their Medicaid programs.Freezing Obamacares Medicaid expansion while allowing for a responsible unwinding, so that people who enroll before 2020 will continue to be supported by the program.And providing a more generous reimbursement for elderly and disabled Medicaid enrollees, recognizing that those populations have unique needs that must be taken care of.After a return to the White House from the House -- speaking to the House Republican Conference, the President received his Daily Intelligence Briefing. Then the President signed S.442, the NASA Administration Transition Authorization Act for 2017, acting on another of the Presidents most ambitious promise to the American people. Many may recall in his joint address, the President said of a dream.And with this bill, he is taking the latest step towards making that dream a reality by reiterating NASAs mission to ensure America remains a leader in space exploration.This bipartisan, bicameral legislation provides NASA with the full support it needs to fulfill this and many other important missions, including: supporting NASAs plan to explore deep space and sending astronauts to Mars, including an endorsement of launching the Mars 2020 Rover. The rover will explore a site that is likely to have been habitable, seeking signs of past life and testing compelling samples and techniques for future robotic and eventual human exploration of Mars.Reaffirming that NASA remains a fully multi-mission agency with a balanced set of core missions in space science, space technology, aeronautics, human space flight, exploration, and education. Endorsing NASAs continued progress towards launching the James Webb Telescope, which will be a giant leap forward in our ever-evolving quest to understand the universe, and establishing an astronaut occupational healthcare program, something that NASA has considered a priority for years.After the bill signing, the Vice President also announced that the President will be taking action shortly to relaunch the National Space Council, which the Vice President will chair. The President was honored to sign this new bill into law so that NASA can continue its work towards making America the world leader in space exploration once again.Also this morning, the President -- the Vice President, rather, hosted a breakfast meeting with Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq. We provided a readout on the Presidents meeting with the Prime Minister yesterday as well, and I believe there has been a readout of the Vice Presidents as well.At 3:00 p.m. this afternoon, the President will meet with members of Congress who are part of the House Tuesday Group to discuss the American Health Care Act. And this evening, the President will speak at the National Republican Congressional Committee March Dinner.Over on the Senate side of the Hill, the Presidents pick for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch has been doing a phenomenal job in the Senate today during his first day of questioning. The judges eloquent testimony yesterday was widely praised from both sides of the aisle, and its clear that everyone agrees, from a broad spectrum, that Judge Gorsuch is a very qualified person to serve on the Supreme Court.As the Judge noted today, a judge is there to make sure that every person, poor or rich, mighty or meek, gets equal protection of [under] the law. His records show that he has lived up to this commitment throughout his entire career, and hes continuing to prove that he is exactly the type of jurist we need on the Supreme Court throughout the questioning thats started today.Today is also National Agriculture Day, for those who are keeping note. The world needs Americas farmers and ranchers to lead, just as the world needs America to lead. Global food demand is expected to increase by 50 to 97 percent by 2050. The world cant afford for Americas farmers and ranchers to retreat, but the agriculture industry has met its share of challenges in recent years. While our farmers are the most efficient in the world, margins have been tightening, regulations have been multiplying, and exports, which have historically counted for over one-fifth of U.S. farm production, have been declining due to unwise trade policies.The President promised the many people in the agriculture industry and throughout rural America that he would not allow this to continue, and he will continue to pursue policy changes that will reverse this disturbing trend.Quickly, in terms of follow-up from yesterday, I was asked about North Korea, and I wanted to provide an update from the NSC: The United States, in coordination with our allies, is exploring a new range of diplomatic, security, and economic measures in response to the grave and escalating threat posed by North Koreas nuclear and ballistic missile programs.And before I open it up for questions, let me run through a few scheduling updates. Tomorrow, the President will stop by the Women in Healthcare panel hosted by CMS Administrator Seema Verma. There will also be a series of meetings with members of Congress tomorrow. In the morning, the President will meet with members to discuss the American Health Care Act. And in the afternoon he will meet with congressional -- members of the Congressional Black Caucus.On Thursday, the President will have lunch with Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin before hosting a meeting with truckers and representatives from trucking companies on healthcare that we discussed yesterday. In many states throughout the country, trucking happens to be one of the largest employers, and its important to understand the impact of healthcare legislation on this important industry.Ill have updates on the weekend schedule for you hopefully tomorrow. And finally, yesterday, pursuant to the Presidents executive order on interior enforcement that he signed on January 25th, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, ICE, released its first weekly list of detainee requests, which local law enforcement agencies have failed to comply with. These examples where criminal illegals who have been arrested or convicted, in many cases, of serious and violent crimes threaten public safety. In each instance, local law enforcement is refusing to cooperate with ICE in its efforts to remove illegal immigrants who have committed a crime. It is part of the Presidents continued efforts to keep our communities safe.A copy of this report is available on the ICE website that details all of the municipalities where there has been an issue and the crime that has been committed, and the person -- not necessarily the persons name, but the offense in which they were convicted for.And with that, Id be glad to take a few questions. Since were talking Supreme Court -- John Roberts. (Laughter.) Come on. That was good.Q  Unless theres an Alito in the audience. On healthcare, the President came away from Capitol Hill sounding pretty positive about where he was going to go on Thursday, but then at the same time, Heritage Action came out and said it was going to encourage members to vote no. Club for Growth is taking out ads attacking this bill. Jim Jordan said the Presidents great, but its still a bad bill. This is going to go to a vote day after tomorrow. What gives the President the sense of optimism that he can get this through, and might he request more changes from Speaker Ryan before it goes to a vote?MR. SPICER: Well, weve talked about this for days. Theres been a lot of input from members of Congress, and I think that the meeting this morning really was a huge sign of support. There was a lot of enthusiasm and optimism, not just for the bill itself but for something that, as I noted, conservatives and Republicans and a lot of Democrats, frankly, have been fighting for for a while, which is a more patient-centric healthcare system.I think the President is continuing to engage with members. He will continue to do that all the way through Thursday. But as I also noted, there were a lot of changes that were made by the Speaker last night, additional legislation -- the three-pronged approach that weve talked about in the past has been put forward to actually make sure that members understood the comprehensive nature of this.This is one vehicle. Theres a huge administrative piece that Secretary Price will administer through administrative action that was given to them when they passed this bill and gave that authority to Kathleen Sebelius, then the Secretary of Health and Human Services, to implement pieces that they couldnt get done legislatively.We can now unwind a lot of that and add a lot of consumer-based and competition measures through the administrative thing. But then the third prong, all the other stuff that we've talked about for years as Republicans -- buying across state lines, expanding health savings accounts, et cetera, et cetera -- all of that has now been introduced as well. And I think that he continues to meet with members and walk away with a very, very optimistic view of where the bill is headed. I think a lot of the measures that have been changed and tweaked and updated have assuaged members who had concerns or wanted to see some additional tightening. But keep in mind, if you are a conservative who has been fighting for repeal and replace, this is your chance. If you are a conservative who has been looking to address out-of-control entitlement spending, this is the first attempt -- this is the first reform of an entitlement program in terms of Medicaid in 30 years. These are a truly conservative set of principles that we are fighting for. The competition that's in the bill, the ability to allow prices to come down and choice to go up, there is nothing more conservative than there is in this bill. And I think as members continue to talk about ideas that have been included in this bill, and the principles of it, we feel very good going into the final stretch.Q  But may he seek more changes in order to further assuage some --MR. SPICER: It's possible. But I think that we've made some very positive steps forward. So I dont want to rule anything out, but I will say that I feel very good about this where it stands now. And I think the more and more that members meet with the President, the more they understand how important this is to the overall agenda that we're seeking to pass. And I think if we can -- as the President noted this morning to members, if you can repeal Obamacare, replace it with a healthcare system that does what conservatives and independents, and, frankly, some Democrats have talked about it for years, that does exactly that kind of thing -- instill choice, drive down costs, allows people to actually get care that they've been promised, and then get on to things like tax reform -- we will have an amazing first year in office.And I think the President reminded them this is the first step in an amazing agenda that he set forth and that we can work together on.Eamon.Q  Thanks, Sean. Members of this administration have talked about the stock market as a real-time barometer for how the administration is performing. But this afternoon, though, the stock market has been off as much as 200 points on the Dow. Some commentators on Wall Street are suggesting that's because traders are starting to sense a lack of progress in the Trump legislative agenda, worried that he might not be able to accomplish everything he set out to do. Does the President believe that today's dip in the Dow is the result of his performance as President of the United States?MR. SPICER: Well, I think to look at any one day is nothing that we've ever -- we've always cautioned. I think overall it still continues to be up tremendously. And I think when you look at not just that one indicator -- I think if you want to get a -- I mean, you probably know better than anybody in terms of what you guys cover -- that you can't look at one indices and say that that is the benchmark of an entire economy. But you see confidence levels, both in small business and in other surveys, that show that there is continued confidence in the market and optimism in the market. You see manufacturers coming back to America, talking about investment; major CEOs and small businesses trying to grow the economy and talking about job creation. Those are the real indicators. And again, I think the numbers that we saw last month -- again, one month doesnt make a record. But I think that it was very promising, not just because of what the number was, but what it had been forecast to be -- right? So it was expected to be 200,000; it came in at 235,000. So, again, when you're over-performing, I think that shows a sign of optimism and confidence in the market.I think -- again, I just want to make sure that we're clear before we go into -- as we continue through the months. One report does not make something to base an entire record off of. But I think that we feel very good about where things are headed and the direction things are going, not just in terms of the indices and the ups and downs in the market, but also in terms of the number of manufacturers that are walking in and restating their commitment to grow jobs, expand, et cetera, in the market. Q  -- feel confidence that President Trump will be able to get a tax cut done this year that would be in place for next year, is that something we should worry about at all?MR. SPICER: Look, I think we're well on our way to seeing this agenda done. The President has rolled out the budget, which I think reaffirmed his commitment to fiscal austerity and to the priorities he set out of defending this country, making the increases in national defense and homeland security that he promised, prioritizing other things in the budget. We've got Obamacare done, on immigration, executive order-wise. And I think that when you're doing big things -- Obamacare, tax reform -- I mean, the healthcare system is a fifth of the economy; that's not small fee. And I think in terms of what you've seen so far -- going through three committees, moving along -- the Senate ready to take it up, his pick of Neil Gorsuch -- the agenda is moving along at a very brisk pace in terms of what his priorities were and where I think we're headed.Q  Sean, last month, I guess, you talked to us about the consideration, potentially, of the carbon tax, which I guess was discussed in a meeting at the White House. We're hearing some reports that there's a pretty lively internal debate. Gary Cohn might be someone who's more prone to that. Can you just discuss, is the President considering a carbon tax? And what are sort of the various things that are going on in the White House with that?MR. SPICER: I think there's a robust debate going on with respect to comprehensive tax reform. And as we've mentioned, I mean, our goal right now is to get through Thursday, and that's what the President has talked about very publicly. We need to get Obamacare repealed and replaced, and move on to tax reform and some of the other trade reviews that we've talked about -- immigration. There's a lot of things on the agenda. But I'm not going to comment on specific prongs of that. I will just tell you that obviously there's a lot of people who recognize that we havent have comprehensive tax reform since 1986, and that theres a lot of pieces in this that we need to examine and get to and theres a lot of voices and opinions that get shared with him.So Im not in a position where Im going to get into commenting piecemeal on where it is, but I will say thats even more reason that we -- lets get past Thursday. When you look at the week ahead real quick, Glenn, in terms of this, the repeal-and-replace aspect and Gorsuch, I think, from a legislative standpoint -- going back to Eamons question -- I think its a pretty big week for the White House to seeing all this done.Hunter.Q  Thank you, Sean. President Trump has previously indicated that he wanted to appoint pro-life judges who would be willing to overturn Roe vs. Wade, yet in his testimony today Judge Gorsuch said he would have walked out the door if President Trump asked if he had this position. Is President Trump still confident that Judge Gorsuch would be willing to overturn Roe vs. Wade? And is this position still important to him?MR. SPICER: I think the Presidents comments speak for themselves. I think the Presidents list that hes put out on 20 are jurists that both the Federalist Society and Heritage have deemed to be people who interpret the Constitution as originalists, as people who arent looking to legislate from the bench. And Im not going to take the bait during a live hearing to comment on that but I appreciate the effort.Ronika.Q  Thank you, Sean. I have two questions on the same story. Recently a 14-year-old girl, she was raped in the boys bathroom of her high school. A 17- and 18-year-old boy have been charged. One of the boys we know unlawfully entered the country; both of them have outstanding orders with ICE. So heres my first question about it: Currently, schools are prohibited from denying access to public education based on immigration status. Does the President hear a story like that and think that it should change or be addressed in a future executive order?MR. SPICER: I think first, let me just say that this is a tragic event, and its horrendous and horrible and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through. I cant possibly imagine. So first of all, lets remember the human side of this, that this is a tragic event that no child, no person, no parent should ever have to deal with. Schools should be a place where a parent puts their child on a bus or drops them off or sees them off and knows that theyre safe. And the idea that this occurred is shocking, disturbing, horrific, and whatever other words that come to mind that someone can think of.Because this is not -- schools should be a safe place where children are there to learn and to feel safe. In that kind of environment -- to know that this happened and the circumstances-- this young women in particular fought to come to this country legally because of the freedoms and the treasures of this nation. And to think that this kind of tragedy would occur to someone whos personally endured that kind of struggle to come to this nation and then face this is reprehensible. And it is not who we are as a country. I think it is troubling, and I think further, to your question, the President recognizes that education is a state-run and a local-run issue. But I think it is pause for concern what happened there, and I think the city should look at its policies. And I think that this is something that authorities are going to have to look at.I think from an immigration standpoint, clearly to see somebody -- there are so many facets of this case that deserve question -- why was there a -- I think he was 17 or 18 years old -- 18, thank you -- and how does that person get put into the ninth grade? Why was -- there are so many issues that come up in this case.I will leave it to authorities to get to, but I think that we are in the early stages of this and theres a lot that needs to get addressed with respect to this case in particular. Q  So I hear you about it being a state issue. Lets talk about something, though, that the President has implemented and introduced VOICE -- VOICE, Victims of Immigration Crime Enforcement -- is that enough to support a --MR. SPICER: No, its one piece. The President understands that victims need a voice, which is why he brought it in there, to help them when theyre specifically targeted or victims of a crime by people who are here illegally. But I think part of the reason that the President has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this.We act so many times when we talk about this and say -- how is the President going to -- why is the President dealing with this -- because of this priority. Well, part of the reason is because of the tragedy that this young girl dealt with, had inflicted upon her, whatever the word is -- this is why hes passionate about this, because people are victims of these crimes in terms of them -- theyre victims of the economic pieces, theres a national security. But immigration pays its toll on our people if its not done legally.And this is another example, and its why the President is so passionate about this. But he recognizes that its multifaceted, why we have to be tough at the border, why I just read off that this executive order is dealing with people who have committed crimes who local enforcement agencies, our municipalities of -- at the state level are not dealing with it.And if you go to the ICE website and download this, youll see its over 30-something pages of cases where theres a person that is convicted of a crime that local people -- local municipal law enforcement, for whatever reason -- and in some cases theyre prohibited but for one reason or another are not enforcing the law and not turning that individual over to federal authorities to be deported. And I think this is another example of why this issue needs to be addressed. Jon. Q  Sean, is the President going to hold Republicans who vote against healthcare accountable? Are they going to pay a price if they vote against this bill?MR. SPICER: I think theyll probably pay a price at home, meaning I think that you cant go promise over and over again, since 2010 -- in the case the member has been there that long, but at least for those who have been there that long and at least -- and even the new ones -- this was a major component of the last election. And I think there is probably not a single Republican member in itself who went out and talked about this. And I think when you realize the components of this bill and that the President worked with the House and the Senate to put something together that achieved a promise that was made to voters, yeah, I think theres going to be a price to be paid, but its going to be with their own voters. And theyre going to have to go back and explain to them why they made a commitment to them and then didnt follow through.And one of the things thats interesting that people who agree or dont agree with the President in terms of legislative agenda, at least give him high remarks regardless of whether or not they subscribe to his agenda, for keeping his word and his promises. And I think thats one of the things that hes made very clear this morning.We pledged to the American people at the congressional level, at the Senate level, at the presidential level to go do something. And this bill, while probably not everybody got everything they wanted, does exactly what we said. Its repealing it and replacing it with all of the principles and the aspects that we discussed throughout not only last cycle but in a lot of these cases back through 2010.Margaret.Q  Will he campaign against those Republicans?MR. SPICER: Lets get through the vote. I think one of the things that he made clear this morning was that he was going to make sure that the people who did support this, he would be out there supporting them. And so Im not going to focus on the negative as much as the positive today. And he made it clear to members that for those of you who go out there and keep your word and support it, were going to make sure that we remember those who stood by us and who stood by the word that they gave to their voters.Margaret.Q  Thanks. Okay, so I was actually -- thats one I was going to ask, but let me try to --MR. SPICER: Oh.Q  No, thats okay, Ive got another one, dont worry. So my other one -- but Im going to go back to that -- is on the laptop restrictions by the U.S. and now the UK, it certainly sounds like that may have been in response to some kind of a specific security threat. What can you talk about from the podium in as much specificity as you can, and if you cant do specifics at least to help us to understand -- are there multiple threats, is there one threat, what is going on here?MR. SPICER: So yesterday the TSA announced new enhanced measures on flights inbound to the United States from 10 of more than the 250 countries that have flights coming into the United States that serve as the last point of departure. I think even ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, who weve not always shared the same point of view with, even agreed by saying, These steps are both necessary and proportional to the threat.Elevated [Evaluated] intelligence that were aware of indicates that terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation and are aggressive in pursuing innovative methods to undertake their attacks to include smuggling an explosive device in various consumer objects. Base on this information, the Secretary of Homeland Security and the TSA administrator determined that its necessary to enhance security procedures for passengers at certain last-point-of-departure airports. That being said, Im not going to go any further than that, and I would refer any further comment to the TSA.Q  Can I try what I was going to try out earlier then? Mark Meadows -- seems like a nice guy -- and the President seemed like he was kind of joking, but has the President decided in his own mind yet whether he thinks it would be appropriate potentially to mount primary opposition, to campaign for primary opposition in Republican congressional midterms?MR. SPICER: Mark Meadows is a long-time early supporter of the President. He had some fun at his expense this morning during the conference meeting, and I think he continued to express hope that Congressman Meadows, whos the head of the Freedom Caucus, would continue to see the efforts that have been made to make this better and address a lot of the concerns out there.But he has made it very clear that he was having fun with him. The President is committed to making sure that this gets passed. Well go from there.Vivian.Q  Thanks, Sean. First a follow-up to Margarets question. Why wait for the new aviation regulations 96 hours to implement it? Isnt the Presidents mantra on counterterrorism that we have to kind of sneak up on our enemies, not let them know our tactics?MR. SPICER: So Im going to ultimately you refer you back to TSA, but I will tell you that -- remember that these are 10 airports of last point of departure to the United States out of 250 that come here. Part of it is to allow -- you have to provide appropriate notification to the host country, to the host airlines, and give them opportunity to get those procedures in place.Im not going to comment any further about the security measures that have been taking place or are taking place just to continue to refer you back to TSA. But I will tell you that I think that implementing something of this nature in that timeframe is pretty darn quick.Q  Okay, and one more -- sorry, I had a follow-up --MR. SPICER: Of course.Q  Sorry. Something totally unrelated. I wanted to ask, has the White House Counsel approved Ivanka Trump getting a West Wing office and clearance? And so what is the administrations thinking behind this? What is she going to do as the --MR. SPICER: I dont think the counsel actually approves office space, but I get your questions.Q  Right.MR. SPICER: Ivanka has taken on several measures to promote high standards of ethical conduct. Even though shes not a federal employee, shell follow the restrictions that would apply if she were. Shes taking these steps with advice of counsel and in consultation with the Office of Government Ethics.Hallie.Q  Two for you. One on healthcare, to follow up on the follow-ups. Youve made very clear that the President was going to be supporting those who supported the bill. And I want to talk about the flip side of that, but when he talked this morning in the closed-door meeting about people paying a price, losing seats, not get the majority -- is that an implied threat from the President to the members that don't back this billMR. SPICER: No, I think it's a political reality. I think if you go out and promise the American people something and your voters something, especially on a scale like this -- and, frankly, as I said, theres obviously members that have been there one term, two terms, three terms, but this is something that as a party we've made very clear -- if you give us this, American people, we will get this done. And I think that to go and make a promise and a pledge of this magnitude and not to follow it through, I'm sure that voters would be upset.And we've seen this in the past. And it's something that I think the President, as I mentioned earlier, has staked -- has earned high marks for, is keeping his word. And I think the President was stating a political reality -- if we go out there and make these pledges to the American people and don't do what we've said we've done on these big things, then I don't think theyre going to continue to want to see us in the majority and theyre going to look for an alternative.Q  And the second, just about -- will he remember the names of those who don't back the bill? MR. SPICER: (Laughter.) Well see.John Gizzi.Q  Actually, on yesterday, I just wanted to clarify that.MR. SPICER: -- on counting -- it's like CBO. (Laughter.) Sorry. Come on, that was --Q  Do you want to elaborate on that one?MR. SPICER: No, I don't. Please go ahead.Q  I do want to ask about the Russia testimony from yesterday. I know you obviously addressed it from the podium hours ago, but there was sort of this interesting moment that happened a little bit after the briefing, where Director Comey was asked about the live tweets coming from the President in his account at the same time that the hearing was happening. And Director was fact-checking the President in real time, essentially saying he was incorrect in what he was tweeting. Is there concern on the part of the White House about the Presidents credibility in that situation, that his own Director is correcting his tweets and what hes saying in real time?MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, lets just be clear. I mean, he was answering questions. I mean, it's not like he was out there -- he was responding to a question. But again, I think it's important to note, with respect to this -- and I saw a couple comments yesterday -- Senator Coons took issue with a couple of the comments that we made. Let me just read you -- I know you guys love this when I do this, so I'm just going to entertain you for a second -- Senator Chris Coons -- this is his quote, direct quote -- I have no hard evidence of collusion. Director Clapper, Not to my knowledge. Senator Tom Cotton, Not that I've seen and not that I'm aware of. This is in reference to any type of collusion with Russia that occurred.Obamas Acting CIA Director Morell, Theres smoke but theres no fire. Senator Chuck Grassley after the Comey briefing -- I can say #POTUS and #Clapper are both right, no evidence of Trump collusion with the Russians.So we've now gone over this on multiple occasions, but at some point there is a distinction between an investigation that goes into Russias involvement in 2016 and this continued narrative that falsely tries to link the Trump -- the President or the White House into any of it. They continue to see that there is nothing there. Every single person who has been briefed who has come out and publicly talked about it -- Republican, Democrat, former DNI, former CIA directors, Obama appointees -- have said no evidence.And so I get that -- we keep getting asked --Q  That's not my question.MR. SPICER: But my point is, is that -- that was one of the tweets, though, that he addressed. He said, former DNI continues to note -- and that was actually true. These are their quotes. This is what theyve said. So it's not a question -- I think sometimes you come back to us -- at some point, the question has to be to the individuals who said this -- whether it's Chris Coons from Delaware, or former Director Clapper, or former CIA Acting Director Morell -- theyre the ones whove said these things on the record. Theyre the ones whove been briefed by the intelligence community, by the FBI, and come out and said there is no collusion.And so, at some point, to fact-check the President for merely quoting them is not -- the question should be directed at them, not us. But over and over again, it's come to the same conclusion. So, Kaitlan. All right, John. Then Kaitlan. That was very nice of you. It's National Ag Day afterwards --Q  Thank you, Sean. Thank you, Kaitlan. I have two questions. First, the author David Horowitz, in his book, The Big Agenda, writes of what he calls a deep state, in which he said these are Obama holdovers in government who are trying to undercut the Presidents agenda. This has been widely repeated on social media. Does the President himself believe in this deep state?MR. SPICER: Well, I've been asked this question before and I'll give you the same answer I've given before, which is I think there are people that burrow into the government after an administration -- this is going back since the beginning of time. They used to call it ramspecking -- it's suddenly no longer permitted in terms of that same way. But this has been going on since the country was -- country came to be, where people burrow in after an administration into a civil servant job. But, sure, theres people, after eight years of Obama that found their way into government, so it should be no huge secret.Okay?Q  Yes. Another question on --Q  What was that again?Q  -- that word?MR. SPICER: Ramspecking? Oh, Google it.Q  I remember -- I remember when --Q  How do you spell it?MR. SPICER: You ever seen my spelling? Come on. (Laughter.) Ramspecking. It was named after -- we're going to go through a history lesson here, guys.Q  My other question was, over the weekend, Governor Graco Ramirez, the head of the Mexican Governors Association, was again in Washington, and in a much publicized statement said that Mexico had scored its first victory over the proposed wall. He said that in the Presidents budget theres a line item for $2.6 billion --MR. SPICER: In FY18.Q  -- in tax dollars, and no mention of Mexico paying for the wall in any way. Hes claimed a victory in that. Your response to Governor Graco Ramirez?MR. SPICER: It's a little early to be claiming victory. I think the President has made it clear that he was going to use the current process to start the construction of the wall and that there would be ways that that fulfillment of that pledge would come true.Kaitlan.Q  Thank you. The administration and the President have repeatedly said that over the next few weeks they will present evidence that he was wiretapped. And last week he said it would be coming this week and he may speak on it this week. Can we expect the President to, this week, present evidence that he was wiretapped by Barack Obama? Or will he speak about it? Because he didnt mention it last night in his rally.MR. SPICER: Lets see how the week goes. Margaret.Q  Sean, when we heard from the President before talk about the need for this healthcare plan to pass, hes talked about the important steps of tax reform and the rest. At what point do you think that his agenda could be imperiled as you look at the vote count? Because you're also going to have a further fight, of course, to get any of this through the Senate.MR. SPICER: So, at what point will the vote count --Q  This seems to be such a centerpiece of the rest of the Presidents agenda. So given that its still not any -- theres no certainty in terms of passage at this point, how concerned are you that Thursday could imperil the Presidents agenda?MR. SPICER: Well, I think its -- the Presidents visit this morning was very well received. I think we continue down the path to get the votes. We got a ways to go. We got to get to the Senate next. But I think members understand that this is something that has been at the heart of what Republicans have campaigned, and I feel we -- I feel very good headed into this. The President continues to talk to members, and we're going to make sure that we grow the vote as much as we can.But with respect to the rest of the agenda, I think all of the issues that the President campaigned on are things that the House and the Senate both look forward to taking up. Whether its trade or immigration or comprehensive tax reform, all of these issues are stuff that many Republicans have campaigned on for a long time and are eager to get going.The President has made it very clear, as he did last night, as well, that, look, part of the -- we've got to keep moving along if we want to get big things done. Theres a lot that can be done during this administration, during the first term, and he wants to get as much of it done as possible. And so the quicker we get repeal and replace done, and put the American Health Care Act in place, the better. I mean that's just the nature of it.But I think when you look at the speed in which we've moved, its been very responsible. We've allowed the committees to work their will. The House has taken up the amendments. Its been online. So this is -- theres always a balance between jamming it down and getting it done and over with, which is how the Democrats operated at one point when they finally moved on their bill versus how this is done. But I think we've stricken a very nice balance on this.Q  At which point will be it Trumpcare? The President said today it could happen when we asked during the photo spray.MR. SPICER: Well have to see. Right now its the American Health Care Act, and we're trying to get it done.Anita.Q  Two questions. First, the Kansas legislature is on the verge of possibly passing a Medicaid expansion, and the current version of the healthcare bill does not allow states to pass that. And so Im wondering -- as you know most legislatures are currently meeting across the country. Will there be an exception for states if they expand before any new bill comes to --MR. SPICER: It would have to be addressed in the legislation. I don't believe theres an exception clause, so I don't -- but I also don't -- it would be -- far be it from me to say at this point, the bill is getting ready to move to the House, the legislation is meeting. I don't want to prejudge the outcome yet. But I don't believe from my understanding that there is any kind of like clause that says if.Q  And secondly, tomorrow -- you mentioned the Congressional Black Caucus. Is there a specific topic -- healthcare, five topics? What can you tell us about the Presidents message to them? And how did it come about? I know theres been some back and forth on getting a meeting going, how did that come about? MR. SPICER: (Laughter.) April is -- okay, don't drag April into that. (Laughter.) Q  Didn't say a name, didn't say a name.MR. SPICER: This has been something that the President has talked about for a while. He met with Congressman Elijah Cummings. He started off in a phone call probably a month or so ago where they discussed prescription drugs and the need to get it down; and then the conversation continued. Our legislation affairs team early on went to some of their meetings and started having a dialogue with them, and that dialogue continued. And there was a desire to have a meeting. The President wanted to have them down.I think theres going to be a range of issues that get discussed that range from drug prices to infrastructure, investment in education, HBCUs. There will be a range, and I think that's part of it. Theres no set agenda to say we must talk about these things. And obviously, I think healthcare is going to come up, too. The President wants to get their idea. Before April jumps out her seat, we'll give her --Q  Thank you for giving a follow-up. I want to follow up on the CBC, and I have another question on another subject. So with the CBC, since you're saying you went through all of this prior to the fact that he became President, that there was an effort to reach out to the CBC. So with all of this understanding that they are an important to deal with in handling some of the issues, the urban issues, or issues that pertain to their community, how does the President plan to move forward in working with them, particularly as some just dont see eye-to-eye with him?MR. SPICER: I think part of it is it continues to have a dialogue, April. I mean, it's simply sitting down with people, talking about issues, talking about common ground. I think if you look at the conversation that he began and continued with Congressman Elijah Cummings, they found common ground. The President talked about areas where, despite some of the narratives that are out there, there were issues that they probably both share concern for and that they can work on together. And maybe they won't agree on 100 percent or 60 percent, but maybe there's 15, 20, or 30 percent of the issues. Maybe there's one bill in particular that they can work on.But there's a willingness to sit down and talk, and I think that's the first step in the process of any of these. It's not just your own party -- and the President has shown this on several of these meetings -- where it's not just business leaders. He's brought in the union leaders. We talked about healthcare; yesterday, he had Dr. Zeke Emanuel in. It's not about just bringing in people who agree with you, it's about people across the spectrum who can offer ideas. And the President -- and I get it that inner cities arent exclusive, the rebuilding of inner cities arent the only issue. But he's talked about -- he's elevated the status of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, bringing that office into the White House to help coordinate some of the federal government activities. He's talked about rebuilding the inner cities. He's talked about school choice. A lot of issues that --Q  Law and order.MR. SPICER: Law and order, and healthcare. And there's issues that impact urban areas, minority communities, whether they live in rural areas or urban areas. But I think that that dialogue needs to continue because it can only help, and I think that that's what we look forward to tomorrow.Q  And the second subject -- as you're talking about bringing in groups, you're also bringing in truckers. And there is a concern in the trucking industry about something like e-logs that's going to happen at the end of the year, where truckers -- be it truckers with commercial trucks, or mom-and-pop businesses -- all of them are going to have computers to log in, to monitor the time you drive, the stop and speed, et cetera. And many people are saying that it cuts into their income. Where does the President stand on that? MR. SPICER: Yeah, I think let's see if that comes up in the meeting, and I'll have a readout. But I know --Q  But even whether it comes up in the meeting --MR. SPICER: I understand. That's more of a DOT issue, so I would refer you to the Department of Transportation.Q  They're very concerned about it. Would he at least --MR. SPICER: I understand that. And I hope that that comes up.Jeff Mason.Q  Just a follow-up on the DHS airline issue. If there is a danger to Americans or to fliers generally with having laptops or things that are bigger than a cellphone in planes from those 10 countries, why would that also not be a danger from other countries?MR. SPICER: As you can imagine, I can't talk about the intelligence that we have. I can just tell you that the steps that are being taken are appropriate and commensurate with the intelligence that we have. And I'd refer you to the Department of Homeland Security and, specifically, the Transportation Security Administration.Q  One other question. MR. SPICER: One out of two.Q  Okay. The President has traditionally issued a greeting to those celebrating the Iranian New Year, Nowruz. Will President Trump be doing that today? MR. SPICER: Let me get back to you. I know that -- I dont want to get ahead of myself on that, but we may have something for you later. I've got to check on that.But thank you, guys, very much. Let's get back to watching Neil Gorsuch. And I will see you tomorrow. We're going to have a week full of briefings. I'm excited. And, by the way, I am very happy that the individual in the press corps who took Tom Brady's jersey -- (laughter) -- that that has been returned properly. Another bad on the press, but we have righted that wrong. Thank you.END 2:41 P.M. EDT",20668.01,-237.85000000000218,5793.83,-107.69999999999982,2344.02,-29.449999999999818

Many Americans have seen their health insurance premiums increase, and healthcare options decrease, significantly under the Affordable Care Act. The Administration supports efforts to restore competition to the health insurance marketplace in order to lower costs and expand choices for consumers.H.R. 372 would amend theMcCarran-FergusonAct to ensure that Federal antitrust laws apply to the business of health insurance. The bill supports the goal of giving American families and businesses more control over their own healthcare choices by promoting greater health insurance competition. The bill would specifically prohibit businesses from engaging in anti-competitive practices, including price fixing, bid rigging, and market allocation that could drive up healthcare costs.If H.R. 372 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.",20668.01,-237.85000000000218,5793.83,-107.69999999999982,2344.02,-29.449999999999818

Johnson, R-TX, and 37 cosponsors)The Administration supports H.R. 1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2017. The Administration is committed to providing American workers with new options for access to quality, affordable care. The bill would strengthen access to health coverage for workers in the Nation's small businesses, many of which struggle to provide their employees with healthcare benefits due to dramatic increases in premiums and healthcare costs under the Affordable Care Act.H.R. 1101 would enable small businesses to provide health benefits to their workers through trade and professional associations, potentially benefiting millions of American families. Forming Association Health Plans (AHPs) would help to closer align options for small businesses with those available to large businesses and labor unions, which are able to offer their employees and members common health benefits across State lines. Small businesses also would benefit from larger risk pools, increased negotiating power, and administrative efficiencies, decreasing costs for their workers. AHPs are an important step toward reducing costs and expanding opportunities for quality healthcare.If H.R. 1101 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.",20668.01,-237.85000000000218,5793.83,-107.69999999999982,2344.02,-29.449999999999818

It continuously builds on its centuries of progress through advances in science, research, technology, safety, production, and marketing to meet the demands of changing consumer needs and complex world markets. The agriculture sector provides jobs across our Nation, not just for farmers and ranchers, but for foresters, scientists, processors, shippers, firefighters, police, and retailers.American agriculture is the largest positive contributor to our Nation's net trade balance, generating 10 percent of our exports and millions of American jobs. America's farmers and ranchers provide a safe and plentiful domestic food supply, which is vital to our national security. Moreover, they safeguard our sustainable resource base for future generations. As my Administration fights for better trade deals, agriculture will be an important consideration so that its significant contributions will only increase in the years ahead.American farmers and ranchers are the heart and soul of America and they represent the determined, self-reliant character of our Nation. We are proud of American agriculture and we recognize agriculture's critical role to our Nation's bright future.NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J.

393,2017-03-21,America Needs Judge Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court,"Yesterday, Judge Neil Gorsuch began confirmation hearings at the United States Senate. President Donald J. Trump has nominated the most qualified, principled, and strongest defender of the Constitution possible as his choice for Supreme Court Justice.Judge Gorsuch has adopted the same consistently principled approach that Justice Scalia followedhewing closely to statutory text and the Constitutions original meaning. He has written several impressive opinions that exhibit a Scalia-like capacity to see fundamental problems in existing legal doctrines. He is a gifted writer whose work features the sort of forceful and compelling prosealong with effective, strategic use of humorthat Justice Scalia deployed to great effect. And Judge Gorsuch routinely issues strong, pointed concurrences and dissents that appeal to first principles and make clear that helike Justices Scalia and Thomaswill seek to restore traditional legal principles. These opinions also demonstrate that Judge Gorsuchagain, like Justices Scalia and Thomasis unafraid to question prior decisions rather than accept them as settled precedents.Among his long list of accomplishments are degrees from Columbia University, Harvard Law School, and Oxford University. Prior to serving on the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, Judge Gorsuch was the Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General and Acting Associate Attorney General at the U.S. Department of Justice. Judge Gorsuch is exceedingly qualified to join the Supreme Court of the United States and he is the perfect selection to honor the legacy of the late Justice Antonin Scalia.Its time to confirm Judge Gorsuch.

396,2017-03-21,"Remarks by the President at Signing of S.442, National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017 ","Oval Office11:07 A.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. For almost six decades, NASAs work has inspired millions and millions of Americans to imagine distant worlds and a better future right here on Earth. I'm delighted to sign this bill -- it's been a long time since a bill like this has been signed -- reaffirming our national commitment to the core mission of NASA: human space exploration, space science and technology.With this legislation, we support NASAs scientists, engineers, astronauts and their pursuit of discovery. We support jobs -- it's about jobs also. This bill calls for ongoing medical monitoring and treatment of our heroic astronauts for health conditions that result from their service. It's a pretty tough -- I don't know, Ted, would you like to do it? I don't think I would. (Laughter.) I'm not sure we want to do it. SENATOR CRUZ: You could send Congress to space. (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: What a great idea. That could be -- (laughter.)This bill will make sure that NASAs most important and effective programs are sustained. It orders NASA to continue -- and it does, it orders just that -- to continue transitioning activities to the commercial sector where we have seen great progress. It's amazing whats going on -- so many people and so many companies are so into exactly what NASA stands for. So the commercial and the private sector will get to use these facilities. And I hope theyre going to be paying us a lot of money. But theyre going to make great progress.It continues support for the commercial crew program, which will carry American astronauts into space from American soil once again -- been a long time. It supports NASAs deep space exploration, including the Space Launch System and the ORION spacecraft. It advances space science by maintaining a balanced set of mission and activities to explore our solar system and the entire universe. And it ensures that through NASAs astronauts and aeronautics research, the United States will remain a total leader in aviation.Now, the astronauts are amazing. I've met some of them -- they are very brave people and their right at the forefront. So we salute them with this legislation. And we salute the ones that have lost their lives doing what they love to do.Americas space program has been a blessing to our people and to the entire world. Almost half a century ago, our brave astronauts first planted the American flag on the moon. That was a big moment in our history. Now this is nation is ready to be the first in space once again. Today we're taking the initial steps toward a bold and brave new future for American space flight.I am honored to sign this new bill -- the folks behind me have been so involved in it. They love NASA. They love everything it stands for, and they love the people in their areas. You have a couple of areas that are going to be very much benefitted by this.So I just want to thank all of the people standing behind me. Theyve done a great service for the country and for their community. A lot of jobs -- and these are great jobs. So thank you very much. And we'll sign this.(The bill is signed.) So we'll hold that up. A lot of pages. Look at the pages in there. Thats a lot of -- (laughter.) We dont want to let that slip.

Thank you very much for your support. (Applause.)THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Does anybody have anything to say? Ted, do you want to say something?SENATOR CRUZ: Well, this is terrific. The first time in seven years weve had a NASA authorization bill. Thank you, Mr. President, for signing it. This means a great deal to the nations space exploration, it means a great deal to the state of Texas, and it continues Americas leadership in space. So thank you for your leadership.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Ted. Marco?SENATOR RUBIO: I just think Im happy to see that Florida is going to continue to more than Texas is with NASA, Mr. President. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: Going to be a good competition.Mr. Vice President.Okay, Senator. Well, hes a Democrat. I wasnt going to let him speak. (Laughter.) You guys love me. SENATOR NELSON: It puts us on the dual track. We have the commercial companies going to and from the International Space Station, and we have NASA going out and exploring the heavens. And were going to Mars.THE PRESIDENT: I love that. I love that.REPRESENTATIVE: Mr. President, if I may. Just as Americans remember that President Eisenhower was the father of the Interstate Highway System, with you bill signing today and you vision and leadership, future generations will remember that President Donald Trump was the father of the interplanetary highway system.THE PRESIDENT: Well, that sounds exciting. (Laughter and applause.) First, we want to fix our highways. Were going to fix our highways.REPRESENTATIVE SMITH: Mr. President, as House Subcommittee chair, Id like to -- and actually part of the author of the new crew act for our astronauts, that started in a meeting with astronaut Scott Kelly after he got back from nearly a year in space. And I said, what can we do for you in the House of Representatives? He said, take care of us. Make sure were hanging on to this data so that future astronauts will be treated right and theyll know what to do, and make the proper adjustments for folks when theyre up there in the ISS and on beyond. So I want to thank everybody here. I thank these astronauts who have put their lives on the line.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.THE VICE PRESIDENT: I want to, on behalf of the President and all of us, I want to thank all these members of Congress, these courageous astronauts for their work on this, but to assure you that, in very short order, the President will be taking action to relaunch the National Space Council. Hes asked me to chair that, as Vice Presidents have in the past. And were going to be bringing together the best and brightest in NASA and also in the private sector. We have elected a builder for President. And as he said, America once again has to start building and leading to the stars. So thank you, Mr. President.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

399,2017-03-22,"Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, 3/22/2017, #26","James S. Brady Briefing Room1:41 P.M. EDTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon. First, at the top, I wanted to note that the President has been briefed on the situation in London. He just spoke to Prime Minister May, and well have a readout on that situation and that call soon.We obviously condemn todays attack in Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating as an act of terrorism. And we applaud the quick response that the British police and their first responders made to the situation. The victims in this are in our thoughts and our prayers.The City of London and Her Majesty's government have thefull support of the U.S. government in responding to the attack and bringing those to justice who are responsible. We will provide you with further updates as warranted and, as I mentioned, a readout of the President's call with the Prime Minister.Turning to the events of today -- this morning, the President received his daily intelligence briefing. He stopped by the Women in Healthcare panel hosted by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Systems Administrator, Seema Verma. And also, that event was attended by the Vice President and the Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Tom Price.Healthcare professionals have seen the challenges of implementing Obamacare firsthand. They're a valuable asset to the President and his team as we continue to consider and enact policies, like the American Health Care Act, that will make healthcare more accessible and affordable for everyone.The women who were at the roundtable today represent the physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and administrators who make sure that people around the country receive the necessary preventative and lifesaving care that they need every day.The doctors who attend to the patients in the family practices, emergency rooms, and clinics -- and those who support them on the administrative and technical sides -- are one of our countrys most treasured resources.With the passage of the American Health Care Act and the rest of the Presidents healthcare reform agenda, everyone, regardless of their financial situation, will be able to take full advantage of this resource.Thats why, at last count, over 40 major associations have expressed their support for the American Health Care Act, with several of them, including the U.S. Chamber [of Commerce], the National Federation of Independent Businesses, and, just today, the National Taxpayers Union calling it a key vote.Following his appearance at the panel, the President and his legislative affairs team hosted several members of the House of Representatives for another meeting on the American Health Care Act. The President acknowledged, as he has before, that the AHCA is only one step in the larger process of fixing the broken healthcare system created by Obamacare, but its an essential first step.Undoing and fixing all of the misguided policies is going to require a holistic, multistep process. And thats why the President and his team are fully committed to maintaining an open line of communication with Capitol Hill leadership throughout this entire process.Throughout the weeks since the AHCA was first introduced, they have been meeting with Republican members from across the political spectrum, many of whom weve seen move from no to yes, as they learn more about the legislation and amendments that have been adopted. Continued coordination between administrative and legislative actions will ensure that our new healthcare system is effective and efficient.This afternoon, the President will meet with the Congressional Black Caucuss Executive Committee. The President has brought in and will continue to hear from representatives of all interests as he continues to note that he is the President of all Americans. Diversity makes our nation strong, and it also means that we don't necessarily agree on every policy item but that we continue to have a dialogue towards productive policies that help America move forward.The President looks forward to discussing the CBCs policy priorities and finding ways that they can work together where those priorities align.This evening, the President will have dinner with Secretaryof State Tillerson. Today at the State Department, Secretary Tillerson hosted the foreign ministers and senior leaders of the Global Coalition working to defeat ISIS for the first meeting of the full coalition of 68 members since December 2014. This meeting follows up on the defense ministerial Secretary Mattis hosted last month in Brussels.The coalition is united in the fight against ISIS, and this meeting seeks to accelerate international efforts to defeat ISIS in the remaining areas it holds in Iraq and Syria, while maximizing pressure on its branches, affiliates, and networks.This meeting is a part of our whole-of-government approach to defeating ISIS. The Trump administration will use all of the tools of national power, in coordination with our international powers [partners], to cut off ISISs funding, expand intelligence sharing, and deny ISIS geographic and online safe havens.Also today, over on the Hill, Judge Gorsuch [is] in his second day of questioning by the Senate Judiciary Committee. During his nearly 12 hours of questioning yesterday -- now at least I know how someone else feels -- (laughter) -- the judge continued to prove himself an enormously qualified jurist that Americans will all be proud to see on the Supreme Court. Its not surprising that Senate Democrats are failing to gain traction for any of their potshots and opposition to Judge Gorsuch. Theres simply not enough politicizing the Senate Democrats can do to hide the fact that Judge Gorsuch is an immensely qualified and thoughtful jurist with a lifelong dedication to our Constitution.A few administrative notes here before I take your questions: Last night, we formally announced that the President will travel to Brussels for the May 25th meeting of NATO heads of state and government. During this meeting, the President looks forward to reaffirming our strong commitment to NATO and discussing critical issues to the Alliance, especially Allied responsibility-sharing and NATOs role against -- the fight against terrorism.The President will also host NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg to the White House on April 12th.Today, the President declared a major disaster exists in the state of Wyoming and ordered federal assistance to supplement state, tribal, and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by a severe winter storm and straight-line winds that occurred in February.We also announced that the President will deliver this years commencement address at Liberty University on May 13th.The President is proud to call Libertys president, Jerry Falwell, his wife Becki and their entire family, his friends, and looks forward to celebrating the success of this amazing graduating class on such a momentous occasion.Finally, a few minutes ago, many of you may have seen that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, gave remarks on the surveillance collected on individuals associated with the President. Let me quote him directly:I recently confirmed that on numerous occasions the intelligence community incidentally collected information about U.S. citizens involved in the Trump transition. Details about U.S. persons associated with the incoming administration, details with little or no apparent foreign intelligence value, were widely disseminated in the intelligence community reporting. And third, I have confirmed that additional names of Trump transition team members were unmasked. And fourth and finally, I want to be clear, none of this surveillance was related to Russia or the investigation of Russian activities or [of] the Trump team.My understanding is that Chairman Nunes is coming to the White House later to brief the President on this development, and we will have a readout for that meeting once it occurs.With that, I'll be glad to take your questions. Mara.Q  Two questions. One on Nunes and then healthcare. Is your understanding that this -- none of these unmasked names were leaked?MR. SPICER: I dont know. I literally read the statement -- or heard the statement, came out and briefed it. It was wrapping up as we were beginning this.Q  Okay. Today in the pool spray, the President said ""keep your doctor, keep your plan"" didn't work out that way. You didn't get your doctor. You don't get your plan. This is one of the reasons we have to repeal Obamacare. Is the President assuring people who currently like their plan or like their doctor that under the American Health Care Act they can keep their doctor and their plan?MR. SPICER: Well, that's the hope. And what I mean by that is not to be cute, but last time they were promised something that didn't turn out. I can't promise something that a doctor stays in a plan or a plan stays there. But that's a bit different. We understand that we're letting market forces come into play here. Competition. Doctors can change what insurances they take. Plans can come in and out of markets.What I think we can be assured of is a couple of things. One is that currently under Obamacare, premiums are set to continue to skyrocket. We've seen an average of 25 percent. We've noted before in Arizona, they've gone up 116 percent. I think theres no question that the additional competition and amendments that have been brought into this discussion will help lower the trajectory of that, number one.Number two is I think that they're going to see greater choice. So I think those are the things that we're willing to talk about being part of this plan because you can't -- where they erred last time is went out and made promises that they couldnt keep. And I think that one of the problems that they did is that theyve tried to suppress market forces and competition. And instead of lowering costs and increasing choice, which is what they sought to do, it did the opposite. So that's where this is headed, and I think that's important.John.Q  Thanks a lot, Sean. On the AHCA, Mark Meadows, who appears to be a firm no in terms of his opposition to the replacement bill, said that 25 members of the Freedom Caucus are opposed to this replacement bill. Do you dispute those numbers?MR. SPICER: Im not going to share our whip count. I know we saw Lou Barletta, who was a hard no, come out and say hes yes. Steve King I believe had been a no; hes a yes. Member by member we're seeing tremendous support flow in our direction, and the count keeps getting stronger for us. So Im not going to start to get into yes or nos. But I would just say that former Congressman Mulvaney, now Director of OMB Mulvaney, who is a leader in that caucus, has been a very strong advocate of this policy. As you know, hes been up on the Hill talking to his former colleagues, assuring them of the effort and why the process has to go the way it does.But Im optimistic in the sense of what we're seeing and the trajectory that this is going, and the number of votes that are flowing our way, not the other way.Q  And on the confirmation hearing for Judge Neil Gorsuch, I have not seen any Democrat come out in support of Judge Gorsuch just yet. Do you anticipate that youll get Democratic support on this particular nomination?MR. SPICER: I hope and believe so. I think that there have been several that have been spoken very positively. I think hes been extremely impressive throughout this confirmation process, and you've heard members both in the Senate, on the committee, and then a lot of outside voices comment on how well hes done, how qualified he is. And I think its tough for anybody to say that hes not immensely qualified for this position.Alexis.Q  Sean, related to Congressman Nunes, can you explain why the White House has agreed to meet with him at all about what his findings are? And the reason I ask that is because the minute that Director Comey said that there was an official investigate, it might appear as if the White House is interfering with the investigation. And Congressman Nunes should present his information not to the White House but to the FBI. So why is anyone here at the White House agreeing to meet with him about his findings?MR. SPICER: Well have a readout for you after that meeting. I think he did this press conference. He made the announcement that he was coming up to see the President to share these findings. I don't know who else hes shared them with. I don't know -- to your question, I don't know if hes briefed anyone else on it in terms of the intelligence community -- either Admiral Rogers or Comey -- of whether this is something they shared with him. But I think after the meeting, hopefully depending on the classification level, we may be able to share more on that with you.Q  Can I just add, is the President concerned at all that there will be an appearance immediately, today that he has interfered with an ongoing investigation -- whether its a congressional investigation or the executive branch investigation by meeting privately with a congressman who says he has information?MR. SPICER: So let me get this straight. Number one, we asked -- as you know, two weeks ago, we said this was the appropriate venue. Number two, you guys have asked us over and over again, why arent we meeting with certain individuals. The chairman of the committee that -- one of the two committees that we asked to look into this -- wants to share his findings, or what he knows. I think that is exactly how weve talked about this working. But I would leave it to Congressman Nunes to come up, and to brief and share his thoughts. I dont know what his plan is. Obviously, he sat -- he briefed the media before he briefed us. He went down and talked about what he had found. So, you know, its interesting, I didnt see any complaints from you guys when he went down and held a press conference for the umpteenth time talking about his findings and what he's found. There is no complaints from the media when he shares what he has found with you guys. But when he wants to come up here and tell us, this is where the investigation stands and heres what I've unloaded -- or excuse me, learned -- theres seems to be a little bit of an interesting double standard on that.Q  Just to close the loop, because the President said that he had additional information that he believed the White House or he or his representatives would present, related to this investigation, what Congressman Nunes has is not related to that?MR. SPICER: I dont -- youre asking me questions that -- he has not briefed us. He has not briefed the President. You guys, as I noted -- he actually went down and spoke to the media before he shared this with us. So I would ask the colleagues that of yours that ask questions, more than you have -- you've had -- collectively, the media has more of an opportunity to ask questions and to hear what he has to say than we do at this point. So once we have more to understand what he said, to the extent that we can, Im sure well be glad to share it with you. But the media has more information than we do at this point.Jon.Q  Sean, staying on that, didnt we already know that there was incidental collection of intelligence involving some members of the transition team? And I point to --MR. SPICER: Not the way you guys ask the questions. I mean, you questioned us every day about what we knew, and now youre coming back to me saying, didnt we already know this. Well -- Im doing somewhat of an effective job.Q  No, but didnt we already know that Flynn was monitored in his conversations with Kislyak?MR. SPICER: Right. Q  So we know --MR. SPICER: Again, I guess my point, John, is I dont know. He made a statement, went down to the press. Until we get briefed on this, until the President gets briefed, I dont know what he knows. And so to ask -- until that occurs, and until we have the ability to share some of that in an unclassified nature, I dont want to get ahead of it. I dont know what he knows. Thats why, apparently, hes coming up to share his findings with the President. At least thats what he said. Again, lets wait and see how this unfolds.Q  And on the American Health Care Act, Mark Meadows says they dont have the votes, they need to start over and do a new bill. That sounds like youre in pretty serious trouble.MR. SPICER: No, that sounds like one members opinion. As I mentioned --Q  Who represents a large contingent of people who oppose the bill.MR. SPICER: No, no, no, but again, I just named a few of the members that are part of that caucus that have come on board. I think that -- look, every day, you see more and more of those members from that caucus and throughout the entire conference express their support for the bill. The President was up yesterday for a while talking to them. Weve had members -- and the Vice President has been actively engaged -- Mick Mulvaney, Reince Priebus, Marc Short and Rick Dearborn, who lead our leg affairs team. These guys have been flooding the Hill. Theyve been on the phone, having meetings with them. Theres been a series of members up here all day. I think the trajectory is going very well for us.Q  And Heritage Action says you can easily fix this bill simply by removing the regulatory framework -- the tax credits and all of that -- and youll get massive buy-in from conservatives. But can you do that?MR. SPICER: There are certain constraints that we have in the reconciliation process. And for those who are steeped in the arcane rules of the Senate, there's a thing called the Byrd Rule, and it does not allow policy to be recreated. It has to do with the budgetary nature of that vehicle to get -- thats sustainable at 50 votes. Right now, there are certain things that I think a lot of people would like but that will not potentially get ruled in order by the Senate parliamentarian. So I understand what people want, but I think that we have created a vehicle to get this done. This is the only way that we will repeal and replace Obamacare. And again, I think people have to recognize that there is a three-step process to doing this. This is exactly how the Democrats enacted it, and this is exactly how we will unwind it and implement a much better system. Thats it, plain and simple. Margaret.Q  Sean, I know you cant get ahead of Nunes, but what he said was, incidental, legal surveillance using a FISA warrant, which would --MR. SPICER: I dont believe he said FISA warrant.Q  He did.MR. SPICER: Did he? Okay.Q  He did. And thats why Im asking this question, which is, does the Trump administration have the presumption that foreign leaders or foreign nationals will not be surveilled when they are in contact with --MR. SPICER: No, look, again, as I said, I dont want to start talking or guessing what he may say or may not say, or explain this. I think that we will have more information, or I hope to have more information once the President is briefed, and to find out what else has gone on in terms of additional information on this. But I do think it is a startling revelation and there's a lot of questions that need to get asked. I think it's interesting all of the questions are in the presumptive negative towards us, as opposed to ""why was this taking place, why were people surveilled ostensibly; they were involved in the campaign."" Because it's not --Q  Well, that's why I'm trying to clarify that --MR. SPICER: No, no, the question is -- the question --Q  -- was your presumption that foreign nationals --MR. SPICER: No, no, it's not a presumption. Actually, I'm not the one --Q  (Inaudible.)MR. SPICER: Right. Respectfully, I'm not the one with the presumption -- you guys are. I didnt come up here presuming anything. I actually started my comments off by saying that --Q  Well, I would presume that foreign nationals are being monitored by U.S. intelligence when they are talking to anyone. MR. SPICER: And then the question -- I think there's a series of questions, which is, how many times was an individual picked up? Why were they picked up? Were they unmasked? Again, a lot of this, if they're picked up during a FISA warrant, is that American citizens are prohibited by law from being unmasked, from ""having their name put out there."" Why would someone's name get put out there? What ways were they described? There's a lot of questions that need to get asked. Those are the relevant issues that need to get asked. How many times was one individual followed? Did their name get unmasked, and why? But there's a lot of things that need to get followed up on. We're not at that position yet, as I've said now multiple times. The Chairman is going to come up here, brief the President, I dont know to what extent and to what detail. But hopefully, as we move forward, we will have more. Q  Is this what you've been -- because you've said there's more information to come, more information to come. Is this what you've been gesturing towards?MR. SPICER: I dont know. For the eighth time, there is no -- we dont know what he's going to come up here and explain and share. And until that happens, for me to talk about where we think this is headed -- again, we're not in the business of trying to get to this point yet. We say, this is what they have. We've asked that the investigation be conducted and that people gather up information. What they have and to what extent, we'll know soon.April.Q  Sean, I have a series of questions on a topic. Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, met with an official here at the White House yesterday. She's looking for fairness and justice in her son's case. What should we expect to come out of that meeting with this White House official? Should there be a push to make sure that there is an indictment of the police officer's --MR. SPICER: I mean, that's a Department of Justice question. For us to get involved in a case, a specific case, would be highly inappropriate in terms of trying to guess what the outcome of a case should be.Q  Well, along that line, the official, according to Ms. Carr, reached out to the Department of Justice, the civil rights division, had the wrong number; called another department, had the right number. Now, in previous administrations, to include the Obama administration and other administrations, the Department of Justice had limited the numbers of people to call over to the Department of Justice. Has the Attorney General, this Attorney General Sessions, changed that memo? What has he done?MR. SPICER: Well, it would have to be reissued. That's a separate issue in terms of -- every Attorney General issues a memo going back to, I think, Mukasey was the first one -- post-Watergate -- I'm trying to remember who issued the first one. But it has been a practice of I think almost every Attorney General to issue a memo spelling out the procedures that officials in the Justice Department contact the White House and who they can contact, and the nature of which and what their exceptions are, et cetera. Those memos get crafted by each administration, by each new Attorney General.I would refer you back to the Department of Justice on the status of that under this Attorney General.Q  So how many officials here have that right, to call the Department of Justice, even if it's for --MR. SPICER: I dont know the answer. I would refer you to the Department of Justice.Q  But was there wrongdoing in this effort to call over to the Department of Justice?MR. SPICER: I dont know. I dont know the nature of -- I'll have to look into what you're asking. But I would, again, refer you back to the Department of Justice.Hunter.Q  Yes. Thank you, Sean. I have two quick questions. Last November, President Trump dismissed reports he was trying to obtain security clearances for his children as ""a typically false news story."" Now there are reports Ivanka Trump is indeed attempting to obtain a clearance. What changed there?MR. SPICER: Well, at the time, it was not true. I mean, she wasnt obtaining a security clearance, so it was not accurate then. There was no -- I think we addressed it during the transition. An official had actually just inquired. There was no actual attempt at the time. The official in question was removed from the transition team. They had merely made an inquiry into what it would take to get an SF-86 process moving forward. No paperwork was ever drawn, no account was opened, and that official was let go.At this time, as I mentioned yesterday, Ivanka has decided to go above and beyond, and act in certain ways to ensure that she complies with certain rules by maintaining the Federal Records Act, getting a security clearance so that if she is privy to any information that is classified, she has to abide by the same rules and regulations in terms of being in a room and how it's handled, et cetera. We have taken appropriate measures to do that. I mentioned the statement yesterday and will stick by it.Q  And then the second question on Paul Manafort. The Associated Press has published a report based on documents that he had a plan to ""benefit"" Vladimir Putin for a client. And with him back in the headlines, I'm just wondering if you still stand by the comment that he had a ""limited role"" on the campaign. And if you could explain a little bit more about how spending months as the campaign's top official is a limited role.MR. SPICER: Yeah, thank you. I've tried to avoid commenting. I know I've talked to a lot of you about the individual stories, but I think obviously this one has started to catch a lot of buzz. So to comment briefly on this, I think nothing in this morning's report referenced any actions by the President, the White House, or any Trump administration official. I think that's got to be clear from the get-go. The report is entirely focused on actions that Paul took a decade ago regarding -- he's a former advisor of the campaign, and the actions that came to light this morning are about a client that he had last decade. I know I commented on this the other day, and clearly I should have been more precise with respect to Paul's role. So let me clarify this and kind of go through the facts. Paul was hired to oversee the campaign's delegate operation. He had played a significant role in the convention and delegate operations of four previous Republican nominees -- Bob Dole, former Presidents George H. Bush, Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford. And to be clear, he got the job done on the delegates. The President won the Republican nomination after months of speculation after a potentially contested contest -- convention.In total, he was involved with the campaign for a total of just under five months. He was first hired on March 28th to oversee delegate operations. He was made the chief strategist and campaign chairman on May 19th. And his relationship with the campaign ended on August 19th. The AP story focuses on his activities from the last decade. And to place in to context, Paul represented many foreign clients, according to publicly available data, in the Caribbean, Asia, Africa and Europe. His representation of foreign clients is public and similar to the work of Tony Podesta, a Clinton campaign fundraiser, whose brother John chaired Hillary Clinton's campaign.Last year -- not last decade -- Tony Podesta lobbied against sanctions for Russia's largest bank. And John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chair, sat on the board of a Russian-based energy company. This was something tied to Hillary Clinton, who was the face of the failed Russia reset policy. So it's not even close -- what we're talking about now isn't even close to her most significant role with respect to Russia.As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, along with the Obama administration, approved a deal that gave Russia one-fifth of America's uranium reserves. Hillary's husband, former President Bill Clinton, received over half a million dollars by a paid speech by a bank connected to the uranium deal. And Vladimir Putin personally called the former President and thanked him for giving the speech.So an individual who worked for less than -- the campaign for five months for the President's two-year long campaign, who worked with a Russian entity a decade ago, is the subject of rampant media speculation all day long, even though the Clintons had much more expensive -- extensive ties, while Secretary of State Hillary was crafting a policy she said was designed ""strengthen Russia.""And to be clear, the President has no personal financial dealings with Russia. His ties are limited to hosting a contest in Russia once, and selling a Palm Beach home to a businessman in 2005. That's it. And for members of the media trying to conflate Paul's role in activities with Monday's hearing, I have another reminder: Numerous individuals, including former Obama Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, and acting CIA Director Mike Morrell and members of the intelligence community from both parties who have been briefed have said across the board that they have seen zero evidence of any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. And that's not going to be changed by former business dealings of a campaign staffer from a decade ago.Sara.Q  Thanks, Sean. You and other senior administration officials have sought to assure skeptical Republican lawmakers that phase two of these regulatory modifications will address some of their concerns. So what is Secretary Tom Price waiting for? Why not roll out phase two now if the vote is looking like it's going to be a very close marker?MR. SPICER: I think in some of those cases -- and it's tied to -- it's all one package, and that's why I think you saw some of the stuff he is working on, some of the stuff he is doing. But I think the important piece is to get the phase-one part of it done. He has assured them and talked to them about different administrative actions. Again, part of this is sequencing. I mean, the same way that in Obamacare they didnt just have Kathleen Sebelius then go out and start implementing things. They passed the bill first through the reconciliation process, got that done, and then she did the administrative piece. We're doing the same process because of how some of the sequencing has to occur. And then the same thing on the legislative front, we've introduced in the House -- all those pieces of legislation have been done. Leader McCarthy has started to talk about the, that do all of the prong -- three steps. So a lot of it is coming together, but part of it is, is a sequencing aspect that needs to get taken care of. But we are moving in the right direction.Can I go to John (inaudible) for the first question on Skype?Q  Yes. Good afternoon, Sean, from (inaudible) in Newport. Sean, you have a lot of members of the media saying that President Trump -- the President to all the people. What does the President say -- (inaudible)? Yesterday, you had (inaudible) White House grandstanding at the confirmation hearing. We've had Elizabeth Warren (inaudible), the Boston Globe condemning the (inaudible). You had Rhode Island Governor, Gina Raimondo, boycott. You had (inaudible) while she fundraised around the country. What's the President saying to frustrated Trump supporters who dont feel they're getting proper representation (inaudible) and in Congress?MR. SPICER: Well, I mean, I think with respect to Judge Gorsuch, which is I think -- pretty clear that's where you're headed on this --Q  Yes.MR. SPICER: Thank you. I just -- I mean, when you look at the praise, I mean, obviously I would love for it to be universal. And while we've gotten bipartisan praise from pundits and former law clerks in both parties, high number of jurists and former people -- legal scholars, members of Congress, we're not going to win everybody. And I think that Democrats have tried to score some points on the committee. They've largely fallen by the wayside. And we've seen very high praise for him.So I would just suggest that anybody who's got a problem with him, I'd love to hear it, because so far most of the issues -- no one seems to have a problem with his academic credentials, his record or anything else. So I'm pretty buoyed by a lot of what we've seen come out of Capitol Hill with respect to him.Blake.Q  Sean, thanks. Do you take the House Freedom Caucus at their word, Mark Meadows at their word? There are at least two dozen or so who are ""nos."" So how do you get from this point right now policy-wise to tomorrow -- something, anything that maybe might flip that?MR. SPICER: I think we're doing it. I mean, piece by piece, member by member, we're getting there, and we're getting much closer. The last couple days we've continued to do that. But then today alone, I mentioned a couple of the other members. Slowly but surely we're getting there, and I feel confident that when the vote comes up, we'll have the votes.Q  And let me ask you today, Patrick McHenry, congressman, deputy whip, described the President, as members of Congress were coming in here to the White House, as the ""closer."" Do you embrace that label?MR. SPICER: He is the closer.Q  Do you embrace that label here as it relates to healthcare?MR. SPICER: Absolutely. Ayesha.Q  You just said that you're confident that the healthcare bill will pass tomorrow. I want to get a sense of how confident you are. I dont know if you want to rate your percentage on it. Like, how confident are you that the bill will pass? And if it doesnt pass, is there a plan B?MR. SPICER: No, there is no plan B. There's plan A and plan A. We're going to get this done.Q  And so you're confident -- 100 percent confident?MR. SPICER: We're going to get it done. That's it -- plain and simple.Q  Thanks, Sean. I know you said you didnt know what information you were going to find out today from Chairman Nunes, but my question for you is, when did the President know about this surveillance that the Congressman brought up today on Capitol Hill? He spoke late last week about -- we'll find out more information that would support these wiretapping claims. Is this the information he was talking about?MR. SPICER: Until Chairman Nunes briefs him, we dont know what he knows versus what the President has been made aware of. And so how that jives, I dont know. I hope to have more for you later.Q  And a quick follow-up on healthcare and just a quick follow-up on Asia. Does the President believe the healthcare bill will pass the House tomorrow?MR. SPICER: Yes.Jonathan.Q  Two questions on Paul Manafort. Did the President know that he had worked to advance Putins interests previous to becoming the campaign chairman?MR. SPICER: No, the President was not aware of Pauls clients from last decade. No.Q  But is that a problem? You know, now that all this is coming out and there is a whole lot scrutiny --MR. SPICER: No, no, but what is coming up? What else dont we know? I mean, where he went to school, what grades he got, who played he played with in the sandbox?Q  Well, you didnt know that Michael Flynn was --MR. SPICER: Okay, I -- thanks, Peter. Im answering a question --Q  We're all part of the conversation. MR. SPICER: No, youre not, actually.The answer to your question is, I think to talk about someone having a client from 10 years ago that had a consulting company with clients from around the world --Q  He paid millions of dollars to advance Putins interests. I mean, thats enough --MR. SPICER: Well, I dont know what he got paid to. If you listen to what Paul --Q  The documents said --MR. SPICER: Hold on. I understand. Im going to answer your question, if you give me a second. That he was a consultant, he had clients from around the world. There is no suggestion that he did anything improper. But to suggest that that President knew who his clients were from a decade ago is a bit insane. There is not -- he was not a government employee. He didnt fill out any paperwork attesting to something. There is nothing that he did that suggests, at this point, that anything was nefarious. He was hired to do a job; he did it. Thats it -- plain and simple.Q  Im just saying, given that it was such a focus -- you brought it up just then with Hillary Clinton, that these were corrupt arrangements and that the Clinton Foundation was described as a criminal enterprise, and there was all this discussion of Russia. And you've pointed out --MR. SPICER: There is a big difference between -- there was dollars -- hold on --Q  I understand. I'm not conflating the President. Im just asking, is he disappointed, now that he has found this out, that there was this --MR. SPICER: Found out what, Jonathan? That he had a client over a --Q  That he was working for Putin, for a lot of money.MR. SPICER:  -- in the past decade, he had a client, and youre worried about what? That he held -- I mean --Q  That he was doing work to advance Putins interests.MR. SPICER: I dont know what work he was doing. So to suggest that just because he had a client in the past decade that no one is suggesting was anything improper -- he was hired to count delegates, which is what he did, and he was successful at it, as he had done for George Herbert Walker Bush, Gerald Ford, and Bob Dole. He was hired to do a job, and he did it, and he did it fine. So --Steven.Q  Sean, why did the President fire Paul Manafort?MR. SPICER: Well, for two reasons. One is, I think, that there were some issues coming up with his ties to Ukraine that were becoming a distraction. And secondly, he was, I think, sixteen points down at the time. And he was down in the 20s in women. And I think the President recognized that he needed to make a change for those two reasons.Q  Second question on healthcare. As confident and as optimistic as you are -- if at this point tomorrow you dont have the magic number -- should the Speaker pull the bill from the floor?MR. SPICER: No, this is it. If you want to see Obamacare repealed and replaced, this is the vote, this is the time to act. This is what people have told the American people is going to happen. This vote needs to happen. If youre waiting for your chance, this is it. We need to act.Cheryl.Q  Thank you. Wall Street appears to be getting a little nervous about the possibility of tax reform this year. Can you say definitively that the President will present a package of tax reforms this year?MR. SPICER: Yes.Darlene.Q  What time is the President expected to meet with Chairman Nunes this afternoon?MR. SPICER: I dont -- I was walking out as the Chairman was reiterating -- I literally heard him on the streaming -- like, on the -- you know, his comments -- as he was saying them. So I dont know that it was scheduled. The President was wrapping up a call with Prime Minister May at the time that I walked out, so I dont know what was scheduled.Q  And was there any consideration given to not meeting with the Chairman given the appearance --MR. SPICER: I dont know. I just know what the Chairman said he was doing. I walked out of here before anything had been finalized. He was still wrapping up the call with Theresa May at the time.Zeke.Q  Thanks, Sean. You said the President is the closer, there is no plan B, tomorrow is it. So if you --MR. SPICER: Youve done a very good job, Zeke. (Laughter.) You guys better be careful, hes going to put you out of work.Q  So if tomorrow nights outcome doesnt go your way, if the vote fails, what should we then read into the Presidents ability to negotiate and close deals; the White Houses ability to plant any sort of legislation and a legislative --MR. SPICER: Look -- and I know what youre trying to get me to -- but we feel very good about the trajectory of this. Members continue to come with us. The number is going higher and higher, not lower and lower. So the trajectory is great. As I mentioned, everybody is out there -- full court press on this, and this is opportunity for anybody who wants to see this done. But I just want to be clear, we have a robust agenda -- tax reform, as I just mentioned, trade, immigration. Theres a lot of other things that need to get done. And I think theres continued to be widespread support. In a lot of cases, bipartisan support for the Presidents agenda. And so were going to continue to roll on in that. But we feel very good about where we are now.Mark.Q  Sean, I was going to ask, in terms of after the vote tomorrow night, for those Republicans who decide to not support the White House, what kind of relationship -- any change in the relationship -- would they see going forward? Would they expect to see maybe a primary challenge later on? Or this is one of those things where they can vote their conscience if they really believe this isnt the bill?MR. SPICER: I think were obviously -- we believe that this is a great opportunity to achieve the principles that we laid out to the American people. Were not looking -- this is not -- the President made clear yesterday when he visited with the conference, hes not there to threaten them; hes there to explain political landscape to them, and to explain that -- I think that when you keep your promise, no matter what business youre in, you tend to be rewarded -- whether its your customers or your friends, your family, your voters -- that Washington for too long has suffered a deficit of trust, and that we made very clear to the American people, if you gave us this opportunity and this honor to govern, that we would get certain things done. And this was at the top of that list. And this bill represents the best chance of repealing and replacing Obamacare and instilling a patient-centric healthcare system that increases choice and lowers cost, and that this is the only train leaving the station.Jonathan.Q  Thank you, Sean. Sean, would then-candidate Donald Trump have hired Paul Manafort, such an important and prominent position in his campaign, if he had known that he had had a $10 million contract with somebody so close to Vladimir Putin to greatly benefit the Putin government? If he had known that, would he have hired him?MR. SPICER: I dont know. I dont want to -- Paul was hired, as I said, to count delegates. Thats why he was brought in, as he had been for George W. Bush, Gerald Ford, Bob Dole. He did his job. Thats what he was there for. And --Q  And to run the campaign. I mean, he was chairman of the campaign.MR. SPICER: No, no. After, what, May 19th or something. But again, Im not going to --Q  And to run the convention. I mean, youll notch it was a very prominent role.MR. SPICER: Yeah -- as he had done for the other three. He had held very significant -- look, so again, youre basically saying, hey, the work that he did, he had a client a decade ago, would he have -- I dont know the answer to that --Q  $10 million to promote the interests of Vladimir Putin.MR. SPICER: The answer to your question -- I dont know. To look back right now and to say, if we knew now what we know then, would we have done things different? I dont know. Thats a question that the President would have to weigh at the time.Q  But he definitely didnt know. MR. SPICER: No.Q  Youre saying he didnt know.MR. SPICER: No, he did not know. Q  He had not idea that Manafort had done this.MR. SPICER: Of course, not. To suggest that he -- I mean, thats like -- you can think about how many people are involved in a campaign of some sort. And granted, in this campaign it was run lean and mean. But to suggest that everybody knew everybodys background -- did they pay their taxes, how much did they pay, what deductions did they take, who did they work for in the --Q  Shouldnt he have disclosed that? I mean, he did work for --MR. SPICER: Disclosed what? That he had done --Q  He had worked on behalf of an adversary of the United States. He got a $10 million contract. MR. SPICER: Again, Im not here to vouch for what he did or how -- I dont know.Q  -- but the President would want to know, wouldnt he?MR. SPICER: Maybe. Maybe, maybe not. I dont know what the circumstances were at the time, and I dont know what exactly -- so for me to start to infer that what he did or did not do was anything improper is not appropriate at this time. I dont know what work he did. I know what he was hired to do, and he did his job.Shane.Q  I want to ask about Paul Manafort here, too. Are you saying he wasnt disappointed to learn, in the last 24 hours, that his chief strategist worked for Vladimir Putins --MR. SPICER: I dont -- no, no -- because again, youre --Q  What was his reaction --MR. SPICER: I dont know, because the story that came out this morning said that he had had client. Paul has put out a statement that suggests this is what he did, this is how he handled it, there were -- I mean, youve all read the same. We have not spent a ton of time going to investigate what he did for that client a decade ago.Q  Is the President disappointed to learn that this was --MR. SPICER: I really have not discussed the Presidents -- I know what he has made very clear: He hired him to do a job, he did the job well, he got him over the finish line. On August 19th, he was let go of the campaign for the reasons that I have mentioned.Q  Can you say if Paul Manafort played any role in the hiring of any people in the federal government after the election? Did he advise the President?MR. SPICER: Not to my knowledge, at all.John.Q  Thank you, Sean. Going back to the American Health Care Act, there was always nervousness that moving too quickly on it would leave some very dangerous points in the details. Several publications, including Saras, reported today that as a result of a change of a few words, veterans who benefitted from a program called Veterans Affairs, or had the option of getting tax credits, would not get neither under the new legislation, and that 7 million veterans would be cost healthcare. Is the administration following this, and is urging Congress to do anything about it?MR. SPICER: Most veterans get their healthcare either through TRICARE or through Medicare, if theyre over 65 or a combination thereof, correct?Q  Well -- but theres two programs. One is the Veterans Affairs program, and the other is the option -- this is under the current law -- to have tax credits. And my understanding, again, from Saras publication this morning and several others, is that 7 million veterans could possibly lose both under this program.MR. SPICER: I would have to follow-up with you. Im not aware of any modifications to TRICARE in particular that would have that effect.Kristen.Q  Sean, thanks. On Monday, the President accused former President Obama and Democrats of rushing through the healthcare law -- jamming it through -- when, in fact, they actually debated it for about a year. This healthcare law was rolled out about 15 days ago. So dont you run the risk of rushing this through, of not giving it enough time for public debate?MR. SPICER: I think Republicans have talked about repealing and replacing Obamacare since 2010. Weve campaigned on it in every election since. The principles that are in a lot of these have been very public for a long time. And --Q  Understood. But you just rolled out the specifics, Sean. You just rolled out the actual --MR. SPICER: And its gone through three committees, two of which had unanimous Republican support.Q  Just a few days ago. MR. SPICER: I understand that. But were working it through the process. This was something the President campaigned on, told the American people would be his top priority. Republicans who ran for the House and Senate said that it would be a top priority. Its something that they talked about for seven years, Kristen. So to suggest that were rushing anything -- I think weve done this very, very, very deliberately, and very responsibly to make sure that people could read it. So again, with all due respect to the folks who tackled this in the past, we actually put the bill online, let everyone in the entire world read it, didnt jam it through and, to quote former Speaker Pelosi, say, if you want to read the bill, wait until we pass it. We actually let the American people and the entire world read what was in it, watch the process occur, and I think that is a much more open and transparent process.Q  Let me just ask you a quick question about the terror attack. You said that the President has been briefed. He also spoke with Prime Minister Theresa May. Can you give us any more information about who may have been behind it? And should Americans have any concern, or are there any security changes that they should expect --MR. SPICER: No, that would be highly irresponsible at this point. I know the British government is investigating this as an act of terrorism at this moment. So for me to sort of get out and ahead of -- I know our homeland security team and our national security team are in contact with them. Secretary Tillerson has issued a statement, as has Homeland Security Secretary Kelly.So we are continuing to monitor the situation. Were in touch with officials in the British government. As I mentioned, as I was walking out here, the President was finishing up a call with Prime Minister May, and so well try to have an additional readout to you, to the extent that thats possible. But were going to provide the assistance we can to the British government to help get to the bottom of this. At this time, it would be highly irresponsible for us to get out in front of British officials. Charlie.Q  You mentioned that there is no plan B, that plan A is the only vehicle -- the only train leaving the station, I believe you said. Does that mean if the plan fails -- if the bill fails, will the President move on to other issues hes concerned about, like trade, and leave Obamacare in place? And if so, how long is he comfortable with leaving it in place?MR. SPICER: Well, as I mentioned -- I mean, were not going to leave it in place because were going to repeal and replace it tomorrow, move it through the Senate, and the President will sign the bill. We continue to see the enthusiasm and momentum coming to our direction. So Im not looking -- as I mentioned, were not looking at a plan B. We have plan A, its going to pass, and were going to go from there.Jessica.Q  Im going to talk about China for moment. Do you now have the ability to formally announce the dates for when President Xi visits the United States?MR. SPICER: I do not know at this time.Q  Why not?MR. SPICER: Because thats not how it works. Because thats something that we continue to work with President Xi and the Chinese government to coordinate the final dates and times. And then obviously we coordinate the announcement with them as well. But trust me, when were ready, well let you and everyone else know.Q  And are you going to be prepared to talk about the parameters of the bilateral relationship at that time?MR. SPICER: Im sure that -- my guess is there will be a lot to discuss at that time.Jeff.Q  Sean, has the President asked the FBI director or the NSA or any other agencies involved to come here to the White House and brief him on this new information, or is it just the intel chair? And if so, why not?MR. SPICER: Well, Jeff, it just happened. So its a silly question to ask me, literally as Im walking out here, when the Chairman was wrapping up an event saying that he is announcing that he is coming down here. Its not like we picked up the phone and then called everyone else. The first step is to actually hear what he has to say and to find out who else hes briefed, where hes got that information from, and then well take the next steps going forward. Q  Is this the first of several meetings, though? Do you believe he would like to have the FBI director come in?MR. SPICER: I dont know. Its literally -- it literally just happened as I was walking out here. So to suggest that other steps have occurred, until that briefing occurs well see what this leads to. I dont know.Q  Whats the state of his credibility tonight? The Wall Street Journal, which has been very supportive of his candidacy and agenda, simply raised a question that he is not doing very well, and they said he could be on the verge of being a fake President. What do you believe the state of his credibility is as we sit here today in week nine?MR. SPICER: I think the President has made several promises to the American people, and hes kept them. He appointed Neil Gorsuch as the judge, which was one of 20 people on a list. He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He established a five-year lobbying ban and a foreign ban on -- lifetime, which is all what he said he was going to do. He said he was going to cut regulations, and he did that. He said he was going to start to bring back jobs -- he did that. He said that he was going to start to pay real attention and respect taxpayers, bringing down costs. Hes already done that. Hes backed a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. Weve talked about that ad nauseam. Hes talked about putting forth a budget that puts defense first -- he did that. He took action on Dakota and Keystone Pipeline -- he did that.I think when it comes to the President making promises to the American people and keeping them, hes got a pretty high record of doing it.Peter.Q  Sean, if I could ask you about the conversation weve been having about Paul Manafort, but not specific to Paul Manafort. When Michael Flynns name came up at the time, having not registered as a foreign agent, there was a lot of focus on the vetting process that goes into individuals. Back then you said, We trust people to fill out the appropriate forms that they need to. He has been very -- referring to the President -- he has been very committed to making sure we institute high standards here and were held to them.So given your words, is it sufficient to trust the information that the people you hire give you? And can you say with certainty with right now that there isnt anybody else thats working in the interests of another foreign government working for this government right now?MR. SPICER: Its a good question, Peter, because theres a big difference between working for a campaign or an entity where theres no forms to fill out -- when you work for the United States government, especially here in the White House, you fill out a security clearance form, you fill out an employment form that asks certain questions under the penalty of law.Those questions --Q  And Michael Flynn still got through, I guess. MR. SPICER: Hold on. No, well -- but again, he filled out forms under the penalty of law. I dont know what was on his forms or what not was on his forms. Remember, what the President let him go for was not being truthful to the Vice President, not necessarily for what was on a form, which I do not know what he filled out or did not fill out.If somebody fills out a form here, an SF-86, a security clearance form, or another employment document, and lies on that form or misleads, then theyre going to face the penalty of law on that. Thats a big difference between saying when someone was hired on a campaign or another entity, that they should disclose everything in their past whether or not they -- who their clients were. But again, I mean, if someone presented a rsum and it was faulty, sure, I think that if that was -- as you recall, there was another person during the transition that was named to a position that was discussed as not being truthful with some of their works. We let them go.People write things. They have jobs. They describe themselves a certain way. And every time that Im aware of that weve had an incident where someone has not been forthright and truthful, weve let them go. But when you work for the United States government, you actually fill out security clearance forms, employment forms under the penalty of law. None of those cases occurred in the past. And to dredge up someones work from a decade ago -- its not that Paul wasnt truthful, just to be clear -- youre trying to conflate something thats there. Youre trying to make the accusation that somehow he was dishonest or distruthful.Q  Im not asking about Paul Manafort --MR. SPICER: No, you are.Q  Im not asking about Paul Manafort at all.MR. SPICER: Who are you asking about?Q  In fact, what Im asking is, can you say with certainty that right now -- that theres nobody working for this White House that is presently working in the interest of a foreign government?MR. SPICER: I can tell you that every form has been filled out --Q  So you trust that the information is --MR. SPICER: Absolutely. Youve got to -- people who are filling out forms -- so to sit here and ask me whether I can vouch for -- whatever it is -- a few hundred people that have filled out everything, that would be ridiculous for me to stand here and suggest that I possibly could.What I can tell you is, under the penalty of law, every single person has filled out a form that is being vetted by whatever level of classification that they need to get by the appropriate law enforcement agencies or HR entities. But I cant prevent somebody from fully disclosing everything on their taxes or filling out a form. What I can tell you is that -- and if there is an instance brought to our attention where someone has misled it, either they will be referred to the appropriate law enforcement agency or dismissed, or appropriate action will be taken.But yes, there is no tolerance for that.Q  And then very quickly, in regards to Devin Nunes and the fact that hes going to come today and the comments that you began the briefing by telling us -- on March 4th, the President tweeted: How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! Does the President stand by his statement that President Obama is a bad (or sick) guy?MR. SPICER: I think the Presidents tweets stand for themselves.Q  So he thinks hes a bad (or sick) guy.MR. SPICER: Im going to answer the question --Q  Okay, but you said it stood for itself, so I was asking. MR. SPICER: I know. I think the Presidents tweets speak for themselves. As for the rest of the tweets, lets see, as weve mentioned before, how this process evolves and what information we can further gather up.Q  Thanks, Sean. On the executive order on energy independence, thats been delayed for several weeks now. Can you --MR. SPICER: Hold on, why would it be delayed? We never announced them.Q  Your office said that it was going to be released several weeks ago. It wasnt. And then there were reports consequently that said it would be released, and it hasnt been. So can you give us --MR. SPICER: I dont -- with all due respect, I dont believe I ever announced that that was scheduled to come out.Q  Okay. Can you tell us when it will be released?MR. SPICER: No.Q  And also, in it, it addresses the Clean Power Plan, which is the Obama-era climate change regulation. And there is apparently no replacement opportunity in that executive order.MR. SPICER: Can I just -- Im going to cut you off here. Weve discussed executive orders in the past. Ive told before -- until theyre ready to be announced, I dont comment on the scheduling or the --Q  This is a policy question --MR. SPICER: I know it is, but youre asking me the contents of it. Its not a policy question.Q  No, no, I just havent been able to finish my question.MR. SPICER: Okay.Q  Thank you. So apparently theres no replacement for it. That is the answer to a Supreme Court ruling in 2007. Does the administration feel that it is legally bound to regulate greenhouse gases?MR. SPICER: Lets wait and see what the executive order says or doesnt say. I dont want to get into --Q  (Inaudible.)MR. SPICER: I understand the question. Im not getting ahead of this at this point.Q  Sean, will President Trump hold a news conference on the attack? And also, on his upcoming travel, do you have any guidance on other rallies that he may have? Because thats where he sends his message out to the American people, including social media.MR. SPICER: He sends his message out in a lot of ways. If there are rallies, then I would refer you to the campaign website to get updates there. As for future press conferences, stay tuned on when the next one is going to be.Q  Sean, when you learned that the members of the Presidents team may have been in contact with someone who the intelligence community and a federal judge has deemed to be a little bit dodgy, does that give you any pause at all?MR. SPICER: Who are you referring to?Q  The people who are subject to the FISA order.MR. SPICER: Im sorry, can you rephrase the question?Q  Its a reference to Nunes. Members of the Presidents team, whether its the transition or the campaign, are said to have been in contact -- being picked up by when they were in contact with someone who was the subject of a FISA order. Does that give you any pause at all given the things that you havent known before about Manafort and Flynn, et cetera?MR. SPICER: Not until we know further details. I think to get ahead of what we know -- until we know what the chairman is going to brief him on, for me to suggest what he is going to reveal to him about whom and when and how would be inappropriate, at this point, to comment on.Im going to go to Elizabeth Crisp out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.Q  Hi, Sean, thanks. Last year, Louisiana suffered one of the worst flooding disasters in our nations history. Today, thousands of people remain displaced, and communities are struggling to rebuild. With support from the Obama administration, the state received about $1.6 billion in flood assistance through the CDBG program. The state is seeking $2 billion more in federal aid, and our governor has asked for President Trumps support.So my question is twofold. What is the Trump administrations position exactly on the federal governments role in long-term disaster recovery efforts? And also, can Louisiana count on this administrations support for additional flood recovery assistance?MR. SPICER: Thanks, Elizabeth. I believe the process works such that the governor makes a request to FEMA; FEMA then puts it through the process. Im not aware of what the request is or where it stands in the process, and I would refer you back to FEMA on that.Q  This is actually -- this is aid separate from FEMA. Its the long-term part to this. MR. SPICER: Okay. So I know that the budget that was just presented allows for substantial funding for humanitarian assistance, including disaster refugee program funding in priority areas. I think at this point the budget process has just kicked off, and we will now begin the process of working with Congress on -- them draft a budget, and talk about our priorities and where they go forward. The President will have a full budget out in May, and so that will be an appropriate time to do that. But I would refer you back to the governor at this point, and figure out where that stands in the process.Cecilia.Q  Can you say today, with certainty, that Paul Manafort never tried to pressure or encourage the campaign to take on a more pro-Russia position on any issues?MR. SPICER: Not that Im aware of. I cant -- but theres nothing that suggests that that was the case.Q  And on Nunes, from what you know about what he has said so far, is the White House viewing this, in any way, as vindication of the Presidents wiretapping tweets?MR. SPICER: I would refer you to his comment specifically. Until we know what he is going to brief the President on, I dont want to have to get ahead of this. I think, obviously, the suggestion that he made that people were what they call unmasked, meaning that an American citizen who is caught up in a surveillance has, by rule of law, has their name protected; the idea that individuals names were unmasked and let known suggests -- raises serious questions: Why was that name unmasked? What was the intention of doing that? Theres a lot of questions that I think his statement raises, and I hope that we can continue to get to the bottom of. But right now, we just dont -- were not there yet. I think that there are a series of questions that need to get answered as to what happened, why it happened, and hopefully we will be able to share more with you going forward.Todd.Q  Thanks, Sean. On the border wall, the Presidents budget blueprint calls for a couple of dozen lawyers who are going to be dedicated to acquiring land. And I think people are wondering just how aggressive the eminent domain effort is going to be, and how that squares with respect for private property rights.MR. SPICER: As I recall, during the Bush administration similar efforts were undertaken to secure the appropriate property that would be where a fence or a wall, in this case, would be. So this is nothing new. This is the government doing what it has to do to protect its border. I think theres nobody in America, and I daresay the world, that didnt believe that the President was committed to building a wall. And I think that were going to take the steps necessary to fulfill that promise, to make sure that we have to.So I know that the steps are starting to be taken both in terms of the funding and the administrative steps, to see the Presidents vision fulfilled on this pledge that he made to the American people. And well go from there.Q  Is there any update on how the wall will be financed?MR. SPICER: I think both the 2017 supplemental has some initial funding in it. The 2018 budget does, and has two --Q  But that's general. Im talking about where the money will come from.MR. SPICER: Right. And I think that were going to continue to do it. Right now, the initial funding that was put in place will allow it to begin. The President has been very clear that using existing resources wed go forward. There would be continuing discussions about the financing of the wall, both in terms of how we will pay for it and who will be the source of that payment.Q  Has he given up on Mexico paying for it?MR. SPICER: No, not at all.Thank you guys, very much. Ill see you tomorrow. Well try to have updates on the subjects that are currently pending. Thank you.END2:40 P.M.

400,2017-03-22,The Detroit News: Judge Gorsuch “the very image of a thoughtful jurist”,"Editorial: Gorsuch turns back Democratic attacksThe Detroit NewsAfter two days of often hostile hearings, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch is proving himself an even-tempered, deeply knowledgeable nominee who should be confirmed by the Senate.Gorsuch calmly turned back attempts by Democrats on the Judicial Committee to paint him as an extremist whose rulings as an appeals court judge heavily favored corporate and big money special interest, the evidence to support that charge is flimsy.At the start of Tuesdays session, Gorsuch deflated the claims that he is a threat to women by stating the Roe v. Wade precedent has been reaffirmed many times.And through often accusatory questioning aimed at distorting his record, he forcefully defended his rulings on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals while schooling senators on the law. He reminded the senators that 97 percent of the 2,700 cases I've decided were decided unanimously  and that I've been in the majority 99 percent of the time.Hardly the record of an extremist, out of the mainstream jurist.Gorsuch is coming across in the hearings as the very image of a thoughtful jurist. Hes displayed an impressive depth of knowledge, and admirable patience. And hes carefully followed past practice of judicial nominees in refusing to say how hed rule on specific issues.Democratic committee members have not been able to rattle him or walk him onto land mine.The hearings confirm that Gorsuch is imminently qualified, and there is nothing radical in his judicial history. But Democrats want the confirmation of this mainstream, accomplished nominee to be a demonstration of their resistance to President Donald Trump.Read the entire editorial here.",20661.3,-6.709999999999127,5821.64,27.8100000000004,2348.45,4.429999999999836

402,2017-03-22,Remarks by President Trump Before Meeting with Members of the Congressional Black Caucus,"Cabinet Room3:10 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Well, Im deeply honored to welcome the members of the Congressional Black Caucus to the White House. Were going to have a lot of meetings over the years, and I very much appreciate you being here.Throughout my campaign, I pledged to focus on improving conditions for African American citizens. This means more to me than anybody would understand or know. Every American child has a right to grow up in a safe community, to attend great schools, to graduate with access to high-paying jobs. America has spent trillions and trillions of dollars overseas. I guess -- I heard just recently in the Middle East weve spent as of about two months ago $6 trillion -- $6 trillion, and you know where we are over there -- while neglecting the fate of American children in cities like Baltimore and Chicago and Detroit. African American citizens have given so much to this country. Theyve fought in every war since the Revolution, and theyve fought hard. Theyve lifted up the conscience of our nation in the march toward civil rights, enriched the soul of America -- and their faith and courage. And theyve advanced our country in the fields of science, arts and medicine.Elijah Cummings, who was here about two weeks ago, who I happen to think is a terrific man -- I dont know if hell say that about me, but I will tell you, I really liked him a lot. And we were talking about drugs and prescription drugs and the costs. And you go to Europe, you go to Canada, you go to other countries and you buy them for a fraction of what you pay in this country. And thats been a very big subject for him, and its a subject for me that is very important. And were going to either do it in healthcare -- which I think were going to do it in healthcare -- or were going to do it separately.But were going to bid on drug prices, and were going to try and have the lowest prices anywhere in the world, from really the highest. And thats not only the drugs, its prescription drugs. But you go out to stores and you go even -- in any community, rich or poor community, and you look at the kind of drug prices that were paying and its really unfair whats happened in our country.So were going to be instituting a very, very strong bidding process. Well probably need some legislation, but were going to do it regardless. We have to do it. And were going to get drug prices way down, way down. Some people think its as important as the healthcare measure, because people are being ripped off when they need their -- they need drugs, they need prescription drugs. And were going to take care of that situation.So again, I very much appreciate you being here. Its a tremendous honor for me. And were going to work on different things, and were going to see if we can get a lot accomplished.And with that, lets get going. And thank you all very much.END         3:13 P.M.

This bill begins to fulfill the President's commitment to rescue Americans from the failures of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and expand access to affordable, quality healthcare. The AHCA offers patient-centered healthcare solutions that will promote innovation, reduce health insurance premiums, and empower doctors and patients to make healthcare choices.The AHCA makes significant and important changes as part of a three step process to repeal and replace the ACA. The AHCA would provide tax credits for Americans to promote affordability; improve Medicaid's sustainability and target resources to those most in need; and return healthcare choices to patients by expanding the use of health savings accounts. The AHCA also would provide for a stable transition from the onerous requirements of the ACA, while providing peace of mind to Americans with pre-existing conditions.If H.R. 1628 were presented to the President in its current form, his advisors would recommend that he sign the bill into law.",20661.3,-6.709999999999127,5821.64,27.8100000000004,2348.45,4.429999999999836
407,2017-03-22,Remarks by President Trump and Administrator Seema Verma in Women in Healthcare Panel Meeting,"Roosevelt Room11:24 A.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you very much for being here. Its a great honor, very great honor. I want to thank Vice President Pence, Secretary Tom Price, and Administrator Seema Verma -- whos done an incredible job, by the way -- for all of the time and energy theyve put into repairing and replacing Obamacare ahead of tomorrows crucial vote. Big vote tomorrow in the House. I want to especially thank Seema, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services --a wonderful job shes doing, and definitely a complex job, but you have it under control, right -- for hosting this very important meeting to discuss the vital role women play in healthcare and the hardships inflicted on them by the Obamacare catastrophe. Its been bad.Administrator Seema Verma is playing the leading role for us in helping us to repeal and replace Obamacare. The doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals here today represent the millions of women -- millions and millions -- who play a vital and indispensable role in Americans healthcare. Unfortunately, Obamacare is making their lives so much more difficult, as we all know, and putting enormous barriers in the way of helping patients who we are going to help. Were going to get this thing done. Were going to get it figured out. Its a tough situation our country has been put in. Its not easy.Women doctors and healthcare leaders have changed the face of healthcare in America, saving and improving countless American lives. In 1965, only 9 percent of accepted medical school applicants were women -- 9 percent. Last year, nearly 50 percent of newly accepted applicants were women. Congratulations. Good job. Its a good job. Thirty-eight percent of physicians and surgeons are women, and that number will continue to grow. Thats a big victory for our society, big victory for America. I want to also thank all of the women nurses and healthcare aides for their incredible service and dedication to our country. What you do is remarkable. Unfortunately, Obamacare is making it much harder for all of the doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals, men and women alike, to do their job. As insurers flee Obamacares broken marketplace -- and it is broken, its broken badly; the insurance companies are fleeing -- millions of patients can no longer access the healthcare professionals the know and trust. In other words, keep your doctor, keep your plan didnt work out that way. You dont get your doctor, you dont get your plan.So that is one of the more vital reasons why we must repeal Obamacare. Its one of the reasons why were here today. So with that, I want to turn it over to Administrator Verma, and well start a meeting.ADMINISTRATOR VERMA: Thank you.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. You could probably do -- stay for this little while, and then well clear out the room and talk, okay? Go ahead.ADMINISTRATOR VERMA: Well, thank you, Mr. President. Appreciate it. This gentleman has been very supportive as I started my position at CMS, and I am very appreciative to be a part of this great healthcare team.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.ADMINISTRATOR VERMA: And thanks to all the women that came today. Its great to see so many strong, professional women that are on the front lines of healthcare. So thanks again for coming today. Obamacare has just been a broken promise. Instead of meaningful healthcare, we have higher costs, less choices, and more mandates. Right now, we have the government thats making decisions about our healthcare, not patients and not doctors. As a mother and as a woman, the most important thing about my healthcare is being able to pick out the doctor that I feel comfortable with, but unfortunately, with Obamacare, we have less choices. One-third of counties and five states only have one choice of health plan. And so that tells us we are not getting the choices that Americans deserve. And the problem is getting worse. We have even more insurers that are saying that theyre going to leave the marketplace.And I think the other thing that concerns me is hearing from providers. Many providers are faced with dealing with regulations and mandates instead of focusing on high-quality care and spending time with their patients. They are forced to deal with regulations. And I came to D.C. because I was so concerned about the direction our healthcare was going in because of Obamacare. I want to be a part of the solution. Im very excited about the American Health Care Act. Theres a vote on that tomorrow. I think this is an opportunity for us to finally get rid of Obamacare and move towards a system thats going to drive costs down, give Americans more choices, and put patients and doctors in control of their healthcare. So once again, thank you for coming today. And I look forward to hearing all the stories. THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much.END11:30 A.M.

411,2017-03-22,"Overwhelming, Bipartisan Support for Supreme Court Nominee Judge Gorsuch","This week, the confirmation hearing began for Judge Neil Gorsuch to become our next Supreme Court Justice.Since Judge Gorsuch was announced by President Donald J. Trump, there has been overwhelming, bipartisan support and praise for Judge Gorsuchs experience, knowledge, and deep respect for the rule of law.The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Gorsuch well-qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. According to the ABA, the committee confines its evaluation to the qualities of integrity, professional competence and judicial demeanor, and even Senator Chuck Schumer has described the assessment as the gold standard in evaluating judicial nominations.In addition to the ABAs rating, dozens of Judge Gorsuchs former Harvard Law classmates came together to express their endorsement, stating, we know that Judge Gorsuch is the real deal. Having known Judge Gorsuch for a quarter-century and watching him in action, their unique perspective is a testament to the incredible kind of judge the Supreme Court would be gaining. Read about their experiences with Judge Gorsuch, here. It comes as no surprise that Judge Gorsuch is being lauded as a brilliant judge who rules based on the Constitution rather than his own opinions, regardless of person and politics. The Tampa Bay Times described Judge Gorsuch as a well qualified conservative who would not tilt the Supreme Courts ideological balance and the Detroit News praised Judge Gorsuch as highly principled and deeply experienced.The Washington Post ran an op-ed describing Judge Gorsuch as a judge who has ruled for plaintiffs and for defendants; for those accused of crimes as well as for law enforcement; for those who entered the country legally; and for those harmed by environmental damage. They emphasized that Gorsuchs approach to resolving legal problems as a lawyer and a judge embodies a reverence for our countrys values and legal system. Read the entire op-ed and learn why there is no principled reason to oppose Judge Gorsuch, here. If you havent already, be sure to Support Judge Gorsuch and sign the petition.

The Israelis welcomed United States interest in continuing to play a facilitating role in advancing issues regarding electricity and water in ways that will benefit both Israel and the Palestinians and also move the Palestinians toward self-sustainability in these crucial areas.Following up on discussions Mr. Greenblatt had in Ramallah last week, the two sides agreed on the importance of implementing measures benefitting the people of Gaza, and in that regard, the delegations discussed the necessity of all parties to the 2014 Gaza Reconstruction Conference in Cairo fulfilling their pledges to bring humanitarian relief and economic development to Gaza in ways that benefit the population without further empowering Hamas or other terrorist organizations.The two delegations also discussed Israeli settlement construction, following up on Prime Minister Netanyahus visit to Washington and Mr. Greenblatts recent visit to Israel. The United States delegation reiterated President Trumps concerns regarding settlement activity in the context of moving towards a peace agreement.

416,2017-03-23,ICYMI: Why Business Supports The House Republican Healthcare Plan,"Why business supports the House Republican healthcare planThe Hill By Thomas DonohueOur countrys healthcare system is at a crossroads and inaction is not an option. The cost of health insurance has increased significantly while the number of private coverage options has decreased. These failings have all come at a very high cost to the federal government, to employers, and to individuals.The AHCA will improve access to affordable coverage by repealing ObamaCares tax on health insurance, which merely drives up premiums. Repealing the prescriptive platinum, gold, silver, and bronze plan limitations in the individual and small group market will open the door to a wider range of coverage options. By changing the age-rating rule, the AHCA will improve coverage affordability for younger workers. The expansion of health savings accounts and flexible spending accounts will make healthcare more affordable for millions of Americans.The AHCA will also preserve the employer-sponsored healthcare system that more than 177 million American workers depend on for quality care. By ensuring that the new healthcare tax credits are not available to those with employer sponsored insurance and by further delaying the so-called Cadillac Tax, which penalizes businesses for offering robust coverage, the legislation protects the employer-sponsored system.Further, the bill will help reform our healthcare system to contribute to, rather than impede, economic growth. ObamaCare has proven to be a burden on our entire economy by hitting job creators with higher costs, taxes, and mandates. The AHCA would lift this burden and promote faster, long-term economic growth by eliminating the employer mandate penalty, making it easier for businesses to redirect resources to investments and growth.Perhaps most important, the AHCA supports growth by repealing a dozen ObamaCare tax increases and reducing the overall tax burden by over $900 billion over the next decade. The tax increases repealed by the AHCA include the health insurance tax, a literal $145 billion tax on health insurance, and the medical device tax, a $20 billion tax on devices used to treat patients.Thomas J. Donohue is president and chief executive officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Read the entire opinion article here.",20656.58,-4.719999999997526,5817.69,-3.9500000000007276,2345.96,-2.4899999999997817

419,2017-03-23,Remarks by the President in Meeting with Truckers and CEOS on Healthcare,"Cabinet Room3:20 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: First of all, I want to thank you for your support on healthcare. Thats been great. I know you had a big problem with Obamacare, and everybody, so welcome to the crowd. But I very much appreciate you being here and I very much appreciate your support.Im honored to welcome all of the many truckers and the trucking industry leaders to the White House. And I must say, really, you are the leaders. You are the big ones. Im very impressed I was able to get you -- I think it was the White House that was able to get you. (Laughter.) No one knows America like truckers know America. You see it every day, and you see every hill and you see every valley and you see every pothole in our roads that have to be redone. Every town, every forest, from border to border, to ocean to ocean -- its true. Its true. And you love America, and you love the spirit, and we love your spirit. And we want to thank you very much, because -- very special people.Through day and night in all kinds of weather, truckers course the arteries of our nations highways. You carry anything and everything -- the food that stocks our shelves, the fuel that runs our cars, and the steel that builds our cities. You think I wrote that? (Laughter.) Not bad, is it? (Laughter.) Save that -- I want to save that paragraph. But America depends on you. And you work very hard for America. Many of you spend weeks away from your families doing what can sometimes be a very difficult and dangerous job, to put it mildly. But you take care of yourselves, you look out for your friends, and you dont stop until the job is done. Thats true. Obamacare has inflicted great pain on American truckers. Many of you were forced to buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges. You experienced a crippling rise in premiums and a dramatic loss in options. And you just take a look at whats happened to the costs, and its incredible. You look at whats going on with deductibles where theyre through the roof, so essentially you dont have it because hopefully youll never have to use it because you wont have that kind of injury or sickness.So you know the problems, and its put a lot of the trucking businesses out of business, which is pretty tough. In addition, many union drivers are slated to have their plans taxed to pay Obamacare, and theyve been against it for a long period of time. And trucking companies that are considered large employers have to offer government-mandated health insurance. You have the mandate that just doesnt work for them. Youre forced to do things that you dont want to do.Today, the House is voting to repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare. Well see what happens, going to be a very close vote. After we repeal and replace Obamacare -- and by the way, its close not because Obamacare is good, its close -- politics. They know its no good. Everybody knows its no good. Its only politics, because we have a great bill, and I think we have a very good chance. But its only politics.After we repeal and replace Obamacare, were going to do everything we can to make sure truckers stay busy moving American goods made by American companies and workers. Big difference out there now, dont you think? Big difference. We will rewrite our broken tax code and fix our terrible trade deals. We will also eliminate job-killing regulations where -- you guys are so subject to regulations, and were going to free it up. Its going to be freed up. Youre going to be back to business. And well make sure Americas infrastructure is the best in the world. Right now its probably the worst its been in 40 years. I have friends in your business, they say trucking from Los Angeles to New York and back, its very tough on the trucks -- never used to be that way -- with the condition of the roads and the highways. So I look forward to hearing from you. Were going to have a long talk -- although Im not going to make it too long because I have to get votes. I dont want to spend too much time with you and then lose by one vote. (Laughter.) Then Im going to blame the truckers. (Laughter.) But were going to talk for a little while and then Im going to go back to business. And I appreciate you all being here. And maybe well go around the table, just introduce yourself and your company real fast, and well leave the press stay because Im sure theyll be very excited by that. And lets go.MR. CONGDON: Okay.

422,2017-03-23,Readout of the Vice President's Meeting with President Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras,"The Vice President met today with President Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras at the White House. The Vice President recognized the important progress that Honduras has made over the past two years in fighting violent crime and corruption and strengthening citizen security, including through its police reform efforts. President Hernandez emphasized that Honduras is focused on improving the economy and creating jobs through its Alliance for Prosperity Plan, which will address the root causes that drive illegal immigration. The Vice President pledged to maintain close relations with Honduras as part of the Administration's overall engagement with the Northern Triangle of Central America.",20656.58,-4.719999999997526,5817.69,-3.9500000000007276,2345.96,-2.4899999999997817
423,2017-03-23,Daily Press Briefing by the Press Secretary -- #27,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:38 P.M. EDTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everybody. I want to start by acknowledging, as the President did a little while ago, that a great American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the terror attack in London yesterday.Our prayers are with his family and friends. Were aware of reports that another American citizen was injured, as well as the potential as this story continues to develop -- we stand ready to provide consular assistance, but considering some privacy concerns, I'm not going to further discuss the current state of any of those individuals at this time.As I said yesterday, the President spoke with UK Prime Minister May to offer his condolences and pledge the full cooperation and support of the United States government in responding to this attack and bringing those responsible to justice.Now, a little bit on todays schedule. This morning, after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the President met with over 30 members of the House Freedom Caucus to discuss building momentum towards replacing and repealing Obamacare with the American Health Care Act. The members of the Freedom Caucus thanked the President for engaging with them throughout their negotiations, and the President, likewise, thanked the group for their willingness to work closely with the White House and their colleagues to craft the strongest possible bill. The group agreed that their ultimate goal is to implement a system that will drive down costs and increase access to healthcare for millions of Americans, and this meeting was, I think, a very positive step towards achieving that goal.This was just the latest in a series of discussions, in-person and on the phone, that the President, the Vice President and his team have had, holding with Republican House members on the American Health Care Act. This afternoon, we expect the President to continue those meetings with members of the Tuesday Group from the House, coming up here later today.Since the law was introduced, the legislative affairs team has been in constant contact with members the American people will be counting on to fulfill their promise of repealing and replacing Obamacare by supporting this bill later tonight.In the past few days, the President has been on the phone with scores of Republican members, in addition to the in-persons meetings youve seen with the Republican Study Committee, the House Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group. This bill has truly been a collaborative effort from the beginning. Through an open and deliberative process, the President and his team have helped to negotiate a very, very strong bill. He was on the phone last night well into the 11 oclock hour with members on an individual basis, discussing their support for the bill.The amendments that have been incorporated add important aspects to the bill, like removing costly essential health benefit insurance regulations; repealing Obamacare taxes immediately, starting in 2017; reforming Medicaid by allowing states to accept funding as a block grant to implement able-bodied work requirements; and blocking states from receiving enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentages if they expanded during the transition.Weve already seen the results, with many members coming out and saying theyre going to be a yes tonight. As Ive noted before, today is actually the 7th -- and we hope, the last -- anniversary of the day that President Obama signed Obamacare.The President is looking forward to seeing Republicans fulfill the pledge tonight that theyve been making to their constituents for years that, with a Republican in the White House and with them in Congress, they would once and for all see the end of Obamacare.The President -- I assume that President Obama must be feeling this time is up for his signature law, since today he came out with a rather lengthy statement about it. But he cant change the facts about where it stands. President Obama stated that Americans received an upgrade in insurance. But the mandates Obamacare placed on insurance forced millions off their insurance and away from their doctor, which broke the promise that they were given.President Obama attempted to move the goal posts on costs, downplaying the skyrocketing premiums, some in the case of over 100 percent in some places, and unaffordable deductibles. Americans -- he seems to have forgotten that he pushed Obamacare on the promise of reducing costs, not making health care unaffordable.President Obama said Obamacare isnt -- quote -- in a death spiral. But enrollment is nowhere near expectations, and this year it's actually declining. Insurers are fleeing the exchanges and one in three counties in America only has one insurer.President Obama may not believe the Obamacare is a job-killer but the new law, including its job-killing taxes, mandates and regulations, speaks for itself. With the passage of the American Health Care Act, we will begin the process of rolling back Obamacares many disastrous policies.And, of course, it's not just a big day on the House side. Over on the Senate, we begin the final and fourth day of Judge Gorsuchs Senate Judiciary hearings. Earlier today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer announced that Senate Democrats would be mounting a filibuster against his nomination.From day one, weve said that the President made an inspired choice with the nomination of Judge Gorsuch. The American Bar Association has given them their highest rating of well qualified. This week, though, through all four days, he has showcased his sterling credentials and a brilliant legal mind. We find Senator Schumers announcement truly disappointing, because it breaks with the tradition of how the Senate has handled Supreme Court confirmation votes in modern time -- and represents the type of partisanship that Americans have grown tired of.In the last half-century, only three Supreme Court justices have ever faced a filibuster. The most recent -- Justice Alito -- was opposed by then-Senator Obama who voted to uphold his filibuster, and later admitted that his vote was a politically motivated act that he regretted. In fact, Senate Republicans didnt filibuster his Supreme Court nominees, Kagan and Sotomayor.We call on Senator Schumer to follow Democrats to abandon this attempt to block Judge Gorsuch from receiving a fair up or down vote that he and the American people have voted for.Back to the rest of the Presidents schedule. This afternoon, the President, as I mentioned, will meet with members of the Tuesday Group. He had lunch with Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin and Nelson Peltz.At 3 oclock today we hope youll come out and join the President to welcome the truck drivers and truck company CEOs who he will be meeting with on the American Health Care Act as they arrive to the White House alongside two rather large big-rigs. One in every 16 Americans work for the trucking industry. Its the backbone of our countrys domestic freight transportation and it moves over 70 percent of domestic freight tonnage.But the trucking industry has suffered greatly under Obamacare. Many truckers were forced to buy healthcare plans that werent necessarily right for them on the exchanges. Like millions of Americans across the country, they saw their premiums rise and their options plummet. And trucking companies, classified as large employers under the law, are mandated to provide insurance that we already know doesnt work.Instead of imposing senseless restrictions from Washington, the Presidents three-pronged healthcare reform plan will lower premiums and increase choice by increasing competition. The President looks forward to discussing how these policies, combined with forthcoming tax, regulatory and trade reforms, will provide much needed relief for the trucking industry.Also today, the Vice President met with President Hernandez of Honduras. A readout on that meeting is available from the Vice Presidents office.And a few notes before I get to your questions. As the President noted during his first Cabinet meeting earlier this month, while many of his spectacularly qualified choices to lead his departments and agencies are already in place and taking action to fulfill the Presidents ambitious agenda, there are still some important positions that have not been filled, in large part to to Senate Democrats obstruction. I wanted to give you a quick update on still some of the outstanding confirmations.Secretary of Labor-designate Alex Acosta had a very successful hearing yesterday, and we expect markup next week.Secretary of Agriculture-designate, former governor Sonny Perdue is currently appearing before the Senate Ag Committee. We expect Governor Perdue to continue to show why hes the best choice to lead the USDA, and hopefully his markup to be scheduled in the coming days.We also announced earlier this afternoon that Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark will be visiting the White House on March 30th. Well have further details on the visit in the upcoming days.Tomorrow, the President will hose Medal of Honor recipients and their guests in celebration of Medal of Honor Day, which falls on Saturday of this year. We'll have some more details on that event coming forward.The President intends to be here this weekend, so as we have updates on the Presidents weekend plans we will let you know as well. I'll also note that we've got -- coming up on a deadline related to the Keystone pipeline. We'll have an update on that for you tomorrow.And finally, I'm proud to announce that on April 19th, the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the New England Patriots will be visiting the White House to celebrate their latest -- and what will probably be a continuation of many more to come -- Super Bowl win.And with that, I will take your questions.Jeff Mason.Q  Sean --Q  This is a Patriot question. (Laughter.) Q  No, it's not. (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: Do you know anything about Tom Bradys jersey? Is this --Q  I've got nothing on that. But I have a healthcare question for you. First, do you expect there to be a vote tonight?MR. SPICER: That's what I understand the House has scheduled, yes. Q  Any chance that that's going to be pushed back?MR. SPICER: That would be obviously up to Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy, but I have been -- nothing leads me to believe that that's the case.Q  Is the President concerned at all that as he draws support for the bill from the Freedom Caucus that he may lose support from more moderate groups of the House?MR. SPICER: Hes meeting with members of the Tuesday Group today. Obviously this is something that he understands -- theres a little bit of a balancing act that goes on as you try to get 216 in this case. But I think we continue to make progress every day. We walked out with more members in support of the American Health Care Act today than we started the day with, and I continue to see that number climb hour by hour. And I anticipate that we will get there.Blake.Q  Sean, Patrick McHenry said we have an offer that -- speaking of the House Freedom Caucus -- can accept it or reject it. Is that the way that you see it at this moment? Are you just waiting on the House Freedom Caucus to come to your side? Are you at their whims at this point? Whats their status as far as you know?MR. SPICER: I think there are some members who, in the meeting, stood up and told the President, Im with you now. And I think member by member, thats how theyre going to vote. I think weve continued to see that number rise. And the same thing with the Tuesday Group. There are members that had not been with us that are expressing their willingness to want to be part of this.The President went over several commitments and changes that had been made to assuage different folks that have continued to evolve, and I think that we continue to see the number rise. But I think that we continue to see the number go up not down, and thats a very positive sign. Q  Do you know how many came across and what it was that brought them across in that meeting?MR. SPICER: It depends. Again, I dont think theres any singular issue in a lot of cases. Theres a lot -- I think we talked a little bit about sections of the bill that there was an issue with. And so I think theres a couple areas that there is some common ground on. But there was over 30 members there today, and some of them had specific aspects that they wanted to see improved, and some of them, frankly, came to say, hey, thank you, I think that what you guys have done already has been an improvement. Q  With them is it essential health benefits? Is that their main sticking point as far as you know?MR. SPICER: In a lot of cases -- there were some members that that was their number-one thing. But, again, it wasnt universal across the board. But, again, I think some of the measures that have been taken along the way have really -- and again, theres also, beyond that, theres a lot of discussion about phase two and phase three, and I think the President and the Vice President both committed to continuing working and improving and making commitments on the totality and the comprehensive nature of how were going to do this.For a lot of these guys it really comes down to premium increases. Theyre very concerned about what theyre seeing their constituents face. And I think the President and the Vice President, Secretary Price, Director Mulvaney, Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, the legislative affairs team -- were all continuing to work with them to talk about certain measures that have been put in place to drive down cost. And I think when you realize what we continue to talk about, that costs are too high, premiums are spiking, deductibles are going up, choices are going down -- these are real concerns for constituents of these members. And I think that as they see an overall and total commitment of this, its making them feel a lot better about not just this bill, but phases two and three.Matt.Q  Two questions, both on healthcare. First one -- is the President open to removing protections for preexisting conditions from the bill?MR. SPICER: I think thats been something that hes been very clear needs to stay in there.Q  Okay. Secondly, about this essential benefits protection. Obviously among those is maternity leave. So how would removing that jive with the Presidents promise during the campaign to expand maternity leave? Obviously this would take it out and insurers would no longer have to provide that.MR. SPICER: Yeah, and again, I dont want to get into a benefit-by-benefit discussion here, but I think that theres a lot of concerns, as I just said to Blake, that part of the reason that premiums have spiked out of control is because under Obamacare there were these mandated services that had to be included. And what happened was is that older men, older women who had gone past maternity age were buying benefits that werent necessary for them. People who were at the younger end of the age scale were buying end-of-life benefits.And I think this goes back to the nut of this discussion, Matt, which is we have now gone down to a system where in one-third of all counties theres one choice, and its this potpourri of mandated benefits that everyone has to have. Weve lost consumer choice. And so people are paying for benefits that neither they, their spouse, their family needs, which is driving up costs for everybody.And so part of it isnt about necessarily a benefit. Its about a series of benefits being mandated for everybody. And so what has happened is that the costs of healthcare for every individual has gone up and the choice has gone down. And I think there is a philosophical discussion that is going on about what we can do to make sure that people have actual coverage -- something that weve talked about before -- but doing so in a way that doesnt drive up the cost for everybody.Q  So one follow-up on that then. Is the President concerned that without having those essential benefits in there, hell have a situation where women are just de factor paying higher for health insurance? Obviously theyd be paying for maternity leave.MR. SPICER: No, you could have a family plan. In other words, the point is, is that its not -- again, youre picking one benefit and trying to extrapolate it. Its also saying should young people have to pay for end-of-life care.The idea is to instill choice back into the market so that its not just about one particular benefit, its allowing people to tailor a plan and a cost point thats good for them or their family or them and their spouse. But its not just about one particular benefit, its about looking at this and figuring out what are the cost drivers and how do we give people the choice that they need.Sara.Q  Thanks, Sean. The White House and House leadership initially defended the way this bill was written by saying it needed to be structured a certain way and exclude certain things to be able to proceed through the Senate through budget reconciliation. So whats changed to put now these pretty substantive policy changes on the table? Whats given the White House and Republicans confidence that now it can survive through that same process in the Senate?MR. SPICER: I think theres a lot of discussion that goes on. Without getting too into it, the issue at hand is the Byrd Rule and whether or not it affects the budgetary -- you cant have policymaking things that dont have a budgetary impact. There are certain things that are being phrased in certain ways and crafted in accordance with the rule. But theres a lot of smart people that are very familiar with the rules and are trying to do things in a way to make this bill conform in those ways.Zeke.Q  Thanks, Sean. Two questions for you. One on the healthcare bill first. A question about the way this bill is now being modified to basically pick up votes. On Monday night the amendment included that special carve-out for upstate New York -- had a bunch of good nicknames that I cant do justice for -- but they also announced these latest (inaudible.) Is the President concerned that this bill now looks a lot like -- procedurally, it looks a lot like what Obamacare looked like seven years ago that Republicans have spent seven years criticizing the way that bill was brought to the floor, and here they are seven years later on the same day about to do the exact same thing?MR. SPICER: No, not at all. In fact, it's doing exactly what we intended to do. I mean, the exchange that we had with Matt, it's actually going -- the two goals that it set out to do it's actually doing -- driving costs down, find ways to lower premiums, keep deductibles within reason, or at least giving people the option to choose a plan that fits their budget, and then, secondly, is doing things that instill competition, choice.So the things that are being done actually achieve the goals that have been set forth. Q  Sean, just one for you on a different question. Yesterday, Secretary Mattis and Chairman Dunford testified on Capitol Hill that they were willing to, before Congress, have a public debate around a new AUMF. Is that something that -- traditionally, those have started in the executive branch. Is the White House willing to put one forward and willing to begin that round of discussions?MR. SPICER: I'd refer you back to Secretary Mattis. I think that that is one that's the Department of Defense is --Q  So is that statement operative for the White House, that the White House now is calling --MR. SPICER: No, I think that that was brought up in the context of a conversation that he is willing to have with respect to overseas contingencies that are existing right now in the battle, especially with respect to ISIS, and the current tools that we have to combat them. But I think that was a discussion about whether or not we should have a discussion on authorized use of force or not, and how to have that.Jim.Q  Now that Chuck Schumer has announced a definite filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch, do you think it's time for the White House to take a stand on eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees?MR. SPICER: I am not going to -- I'll let -- Senator McConnell is a much more apt user and understanding of the Senate rules. I'm not going to start to tell Senator McConnell what he should be doing from here.Q  He's your nominee, and --MR. SPICER: I understand that. And it's his rules and his chamber that he leads. So I'm going to let that --John.Q  Sean, thank you. Has anybody from the national security team or the homeland security folks been in touch with their counterparts in London in the last 24 hours or so?MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Can you expound on that at all?MR. SPICER: Only to the extent to say that they've been in touch to evaluate, offer assistance. And again, I'm not going to get into a classified discussion about what we may or may not be discussing.Q  A supportive effort needless to say.MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Thanks, Sean. Chairman Nunes today refused to definitively rule out that he received the information he announced yesterday on surveillance, that he got that from the White House. So will you rule out that the White House or anyone in the Trump administration gave Chairman Nunes that information?MR. SPICER: I dont know what he actually briefed the President on, but I dont know why he would come up to brief the President on something that we gave him.Q  Well, that's why it was confusing to many of us, so I was wondering --MR. SPICER: I dont know that that makes sense. I did not sit in on that briefing. I'm not -- it just doesnt -- so I dont know why he would brief the Speaker and then come down here to brief us on something that we would have briefed him on. It doesnt really seem to make a ton of sense. So I'm not aware of it, but it doesnt really pass the smell test.Hallie.Q  Thanks, Sean. On healthcare, a couple for you. Mark Meadows says -- came out of a meeting and said there is no deal. Does the President acknowledge that this bill appears to be in trouble right now?MR. SPICER: No, I think that we're going to continue -- I mean, it's not a question of trouble. There was no deal. We werent asking for a deal. The President --Q  You wouldnt call the essential health benefits package a deal?MR. SPICER: No, I think for a lot of members it was. And I think some of them stood up and said, Mr. President, we're with you. I think a lot of them said, we're going to go back and think about it. But there was no -- the meeting didnt conclude by saying, ""do we have a deal?"" That's not why we had it. I think for some members this has been --Q  No final offer before it is --MR. SPICER: No, I think this was a discussion that the President continues to have. I think we have been very, very pleased with the direction it's going in and the number of members who have expressed their support for it. We'll continue that discussion with the Tuesday Group. But the number is growing, the number of members who have shared concerns, and I think that we have been very responsive, as well as Speaker Ryan, to the concerns and ideas that members have expressed from across the spectrum.Q  Two quick clarifications. You said that there's only plan A. At this point, is there an acknowledgement that perhaps there does need to be a plan B if this vote doesnt happen tonight?MR. SPICER: No. Plan A. Q  Okay, then the next follow-up is just, has the President asked Speaker Ryan to delay this vote while he works with some of these members to try to convince them to come on board.MR. SPICER: I'm sorry, what's that?Q  Did the President asked Speaker Ryan --MR. SPICER: No.Q  -- to delay the vote?MR. SPICER: Steven.Q  I was going to offer you the opportunity to respond to what Leader Pelosi said today. She said that it's a ""rookie mistake to set a date for a bill before there's consensus from the Republican caucus. What's your response to that?MR. SPICER: Thank you. I appreciate that. I think we have a pretty strong record on the Republican side of getting bills passed, getting things done. And so -- I know that they have a pretty strong record of passing things and telling people that they can read the bill afterwards. I think we have done this the right way, and I think -- we know that we've done it with the support that voters told members and the President that they wanted. Jonathan.Q  And related, if I might. MR. SPICER: Yeah, of course. Q  There are some former White House lawyers who served in the prior administration who say that by tweeting from his official POTUS account this morning a video that was put out on official social media channels, that the President and the White House have violated the anti-lobbying law because they're using money that was appropriated by Congress. Is that a concern you guys appreciate? Is that something that's been talked about here?MR. SPICER: It is not. The President -- that is not applicable to the President, no. So there is no -- I believe you're referring to 18 U.S. Code 1913, if I'm correct. (Laughter.) I think we're pretty good on it. Jonathan. Q  Thanks, Sean. The President wrote a book called ""The Art of the Deal."" He's considered the ultimate closer when it comes to negotiations. If this deal falls through, if this bill does not pass, would he accept the blame for its failure? And if not, who would?MR. SPICER: Let's get to the vote tonight. I'm not going to start -- I think the President has done a phenomenal job, there's no question. And I think when you look at the effort that he's put in, the number of meetings that he's had, and the changes that have been made to the bill, theres no question how hard the President and his team, the Vice President have worked to get this done. And it's in response -- at the end of the day we cant force somebody to vote, but I think, as I mentioned to Hallie and several other folks, I like the direction that this thing is going. I think that we continue to see support go with us.Were not seeing people fall off, were seeing people come on board. Thats a great trajectory to have, and so I like where were headed.Q  Two very quick clarifications on previous answers and then I have a third question. I think the issue was not what the President had done but what White House staffers were doing with their official Twitter accounts. So while the law does not apply to the President it was a question about White House staff.MR. SPICER: Okay, so you want me to answer that one?Q  Sure.MR. SPICER: Let me read for you from 18 U.S. Code 1913. The Department of Justice consistently has construed that the Anti-Lobbying Act as limiting the lobbying activities personally undertaken by the President, his aides and assistants with the Executive Office of the President, the Vice President, Cabinet members within their areas of responsibilities, and others confirmed officials appointed by the President responsibility. So theres clearly a carve-out for that. Next.Q  When you were talking about the Byrd Rule earlier, can we read from your answer that Vice President Pence does not at any point intend to overrule the Senate parliamentarian?MR. SPICER: Its not a question of overrule. You dont overrule. The Senate parliamentarian makes interpretations. Its up to the presiding officer.Q  -- right?MR. SPICER: I do, but I also understand how the Senate works. And the presiding officer determines -- the Senate parliamentarian has asked for guidance.Q  Sure, and if the guidance from the Senate parliamentarian is that something would violate the Byrd Rule, would Vice President Pence --MR. SPICER: Im not going to answer hypotheticals about what he may do, not on this bill or any other. Q  Just finally, CNN reported yesterday that U.S. officials believe that -- are investigating that associates of President Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clintons campaign. Im wondering if you can respond to that or say definitely that they did not do so.MR. SPICER: So lets actually look at what CNN reported. They reported that anonymous U.S. officials have told them that information indicates that association of the campaign and suspected operatives coordinated, which they admit is not conclusive of anything, is bordering on collusion. The last line of the thing said, The FBI cannot yet prove that collusion took place.I think theres probably more evidence that CNN colluded with the Clinton campaign to give her debate questions than the Trump campaign gave any kind of collusion. So I think when it comes down to that reporting, it is filled with a bunch of subjective terms about this person may have done this, possibly could have done that. And at the end of the story, if you wade to the very bottom it says, The FBI cannot yet prove that collusion took place.So Ive addressed this type of reporting in the past, and this fits right in.John.Q  Without getting too deep in the weeds on exactly what this strategy is in the Senate to get this bill through the Byrd Rule, is the President confident that the strategy thats being developed in the Senate will result in a bill that can pass muster?MR. SPICER: Yes. Q  And the President told us several weeks ago that if it looked like the Democrats were going to filibuster Judge Gorsuch, he would encourage Mitch McConnell to invoke the nuclear option. Has the Presidents position on that changed at all?MR. SPICER: The President has not spoken to Senator McConnell yet. I think Senator Schumer, as you know, within the last hour or so came out with his position. Im sure that after we get through tonight the President will have some kind of conversation with Senator McConnell and discuss Senate strategy. Were not there yet.Q  Thanks, Sean. Following up on Jordans question and then I have a follow-up on Hallies question. How did Chairman Nunes end up at the White House yesterday? This morning he said he invited himself here, but thats sort of an uncommon way to end up here. Can you take us through sort of the tick-tock of what happened?MR. SPICER: No. I dont know how he got here. I assume in a car. (Laughter.) But I also dont track him. I dont keep his schedule either.Q  You know who he spoke with at the White House?MR. SPICER: No, I dont. He literally gave a press conference as we were starting and saying Im going to go down to the White House after we brief the press.Q  Was this the first time that the White House was made aware of the surveillance that he brought to the President yesterday?MR. SPICER: I believe that the information that he shared with the President was new.Q  And then the follow-up on healthcare. Is there any sort of plan if the bill does not pass tonight?MR. SPICER: No.Q  What is the plan B?MR. SPICER: No, its going to pass. So thats it. Kaitlan.Q  Now that youve been briefed -- I know yesterday you hadnt been on everything had just happened -- can you say if the information that Nunes had is the same information that the President said he had that would be revealed this week?MR. SPICER: Were not going to -- my understanding, because I was not briefed on the contents of that, was that he spoke generally about what he had seen in these reports that he had been made privy to, but that there was further details he wanted the President to know what he had seen and that it wasnt related to Russia. But hes continuing, as, again -- all of his public comments are that he is going to continue to pursue this and that hell have further updates later. But Im not aware of the specific nature of it. Cecilia.Q  Wait, one more question. What will the Presidents reaction be to Republicans who vote against the healthcare bill tonight? And are they being encouraged the vote their conscience?MR. SPICER: Well, I think Ive addressed this before, but I think the President has made very clear that Republicans in particular have made a commitment to constituents and to the American people that if given the opportunity to have a Republican President, a Republican Senate and a Republican House, that they would enact a repeal-and-replace and put into it a patient-centered healthcare.He believes, as he mentioned during --when he met with the House conference, as he mentioned with the members of the Freedom Caucus today, and I think in several meetings, that this is something that weve talked about. Youve taken a bunch of these free votes when it didnt matter because you didnt have a Republican President. And you got to vote for repeal and go back and tell your constituents something like 50 times -- well, this is a live ball now. And this is for real, and were going to do what we pledged to the American people and keep our word.And hes made it very clear that part of the reason that he got elected is because he went out and made a series of bold pledges to the American people about what he would do if he were President, and hes acting on those. And hes acting swiftly and boldly with respect to this in particular -- and that he believes that not just him, but that members of the House and the Senate have an obligation to fulfill the promise and the pledge that they made to the American people. Cecilia.Q  Regardless of what happens tonight, will we hear from the President? Will he come out and make a statement?MR. SPICER: I think its going to depend on what time the vote is. So I dont want to commit -- Im sure in some way, shape or form well have some kind of comment.Q  And similar to the question you were asked here, but is the President, no matter what happens, prepared to take responsibility for the outcome of this bill?MR. SPICER: In what way? Q  Whether it succeeds or fails? His name is on it. A lot of people think so.MR. SPICER: Well, I think that in the sense that weve been very clear about this is a priority of ours and weve worked with him. But again, I go back to -- at the end of the day, we cant make people vote. Weve done everything we can to listen to them, to incorporate their thoughts, to incorporate their ideas to make the bill as best we can. But its a balancing act, make no mistake about it, that theres a full spectrum of folks in the House that have disparate desires.But I think we can all commit that this is the one vehicle thats going to repeal something that almost every single Republican that Im aware of has pledged to do if they were reelected or elected. And I think that theres a desire that -- we understand that not every member is going to find this perfect. Thats what happens when you need to get, in this case, 216 votes. But its the best bill that takes into consideration all of the concerns and all of the goals and all the values -- and I understand that in a lot of cases, some of it isnt a question of the policy, its a question of the timing and some of the things that people want that are happening in phase three and phase one.But as weve addressed, the Byrd Rule, which is -- to most people, this arcane thing probably even in the House that dont have to deal with it -- in the Senate that deals with whether or not -- and if there is a -- if it is loaded up with things that are stricken, then it doesnt serve us any good. I think that we have put together a very comprehensive approach to addressing how to actually repeal and how to actually replace. I think the President walked through with the House Freedom Caucus today several of the administrative acts that Secretary Price would be taking in accordance with the authority that was granted to him by the Obamacare legislation and by some of the actions that Secretary Sebelius took back in 2009.Theres a lot of concern among members about some of the sequencing on things, and I think that we have continued to not -- so this isnt just about policy. Some of its about sequencing and timing. And I think the President and the Vice President and the rest of the team have done a lot to reassure them on the sequencing and how this thing is going to act. So that discussion I think has continued to be very productive to reassure members how this thing is going to happen and take place.Eamon.Q  Thanks, Sean. A moment ago you said that there was some members of the House Freedom Caucus in the meeting today who were nos who stood up and said, Mr. President, Im with you. Can you tell us how many of those there were and what their names were?MR. SPICER: Not yet. And Im not trying to be cute about this. I think as we do this -- as we do the whip count, I think as you can imagine, that weve got to make sure that we dont -- that this balancing act -- and youve got to now make sure that certain people dont fall off the end as you pick up certain people. And so were keeping that vote total rather tight right now. But I feel very buoyed by the direction that were headed in.Q  And can you give us a sense of what specific offer was made? Theres been reporting that the final offer was put on the table for these guys. What specific changes did the President offer them today that were new that we havent seen before?MR. SPICER: Its not just changes. As I mentioned to Cecilia, part of this is some of the administrative stuff and making sure that they have reassurances that certain things that Secretary Sebelius enacted when she enrolled the bill -- or, excuse me, enacted the bill that will be acted upon immediately. And so there was an enumeration of some of those things and a commitment on some of the other aspects of support that would be given for the phase three bill about buying across state lines, increasing HHS -- HSAs. There was a lot of talk about that. And thats where I think a lot of this comes down to right now, especially among those members. They feel very good about the changes that have been made in the managers amendment and they feel very good. There is some question about the commitment and changes that might take place in the Senate, and so that -- there was a lot of can we count on this when this happens. So I just want to -- some of this is working that way.Goyal.Q  Thank you very much, Sean. Two questions please. One, as far as 68 countries representing against terrorism or against ISIS at the State Department under the leadership of Secretary of State Tillerson -- there was an advisor to the President of Afghanistan coming here speaking at CSIS. And also, the day before yesterday, at the (inaudible) he was addressing Mr. Rabbani, who is the foreign minister of Afghanistan. What both were saying or addressing to the audience at these two think tanks that unless we control two countries who are financing and training -- Saudi Arabia is financing in the name of charities, and Pakistan is training. So what is the presidential message to this group? At the same time, there is a Mr. Abdel Said, who is wanted by the U.S., $10 million -- theres a bounty on him. And hes openly spewing hatred against the U.S. and India and Pakistan. So where do we go from here?MR. SPICER: So, look, Secretary Tillerson is the meeting of -- have been going through this meeting with 68 of those members that are committed to addressing Syria and ISIS. Im not going to get ahead of the internal discussions that Secretary Tillerson is having related to the administrations review of Syrias policy in particular. But I would stay in touch with the State Department on that. John.Q  The second part of my question please.MR. SPICER: Okay.Q  As far as Presidents relation with the Indian American community is concerned, that 40 years it was 1976 when a spiritual leader came from -- all the way from India to New York City, and he wanted to have a parade, Festival of India in New York, but they didnt have any resources or sources, but Mr. Trump that time, Donald Trump, came out and helped the group to go on this festival. But now, candidate Trump was also among the Indian American community celebrating Diwali in New Jersey -- same group who has been now at the White House this weekend, a peaceful prayer and vigil. Theyre asking the President to come out or meet the Indian American community against hate crimes or somebody from the White House.MR. SPICER: Well, I think weve discussed the nature of hate crimes in the past and weve condemned the act that happened in Kansas earlier this year. Obviously Im sure that this is a very important issue for them. The President is right now focused in particular on getting Obamacare repealed and replaced, the issue in London -- theres a lot thats occupying his time. And Im sure that we will continue to monitor that situation as well.Mara.Q  Will he come --MR. SPICER: Maybe someday. Well see.Q  I have a question about essential health benefits. The President said to Tucker Carlson that he wasnt going to -- if his people werent taken care of, he wasnt going to sign anything. And Im wondering what he says to people who voted for him who relied on the provisions for opioid addiction -- things that were included in those essential health benefits, if they go away.MR. SPICER: But -- yeah, I -- respectfully, I think thats a false choice. Again, the problem with Obamacare is it took all of these benefits, mandated that they had to be offered, and what happened is it spiked insurance rates, it spiked deductibles, and choices went away. And the point isnt making a benefit go away or not. And thats why I think its, respectfully, a false choice. Its actually offering options to people. Its literally like any other service or product that we have here in this country where you can buy what you want. Sometimes its at a lower price point because thats what you can afford. Sometimes you buy features on a product because you want those features. Sometimes you determine that you dont need -- but people should have choice in the healthcare market just the same way that they do in almost every other industry.I mean, thats the point. Its not about giving or taking, its about the point that they are being mandated in a way -- and thats the point, is that people should buy what they want, and what is appropriate for themselves or their family. I mean that --Q  Right now, where do the essential health benefits stand? That theyre going to be part of this bill, or still --MR. SPICER: I think my understanding is theyre part of the House bill.Q  Theyre going to be part of this bill?MR. SPICER: Yeah.Alexis.Q  Sean, just to follow up on Maras question. I think part of the inherent question is, a lot of people buy insurance not knowing what theyre going to need.MR. SPICER: Well, I think if youre an older man, you can generally say that youre not going to need maternity care.Q  Thats possible. But here is the question Mara was suggesting: Opioi0d and drug addiction -- you dont buy your insurance and say, I really need that back-up coverage because I think Im going to get addicted to painkillers or opioid drugs. So the question is, is the President confident that the kind of choice he has ambitions for would be offered by insurance companies on their own volition?MR. SPICER: I think several plans, Im sure -- I mean, again, youre asking -- I think theres a market for things, but like anything else, I dont think you buy insurance for anything, Alexis, guessing saying, hey, I assume that if my house burns down, Im going to need to replace all these things. You buy insurance -- thats the whole point of insurance. And I think when people look at it, theyre going to buy what they may not need. But theyre going to evaluate it, and thats the same thing when you look at a retirement plan, or a car insurance, or any else. You evaluate what your needs are, and then make the decision whats best for you and your family.Sarah.Q  Sean, can you say unequivocally that associates of President Trump did not collude with suspected Russian operatives and coordinate on the release --MR. SPICER: So say the first part of it again.Q  Can you say unequivocally that associates of Donald Trump --MR. SPICER: See, I think this is -- with all due -- and this is -- the way that the term ""associates"" is flown around, I dont understand what that means. If you're talking about employees of the campaign, employees of the transition or in the White House, that's one thing. But the way that this term ""associates"" gets thrown out -- and again, we talked about this yesterday -- you pull out a gentleman who was employed by someone for five months and talk about a client that he had 10 years ago? No, I can't unequivocally say that nobody ever in his past, who may or not have come in contact with him, sat next to him in a plane, who grew up with him in grade school -- because that's, a lot of times, this --Q  This gentleman, Paul Manafort, you're referring to was a campaign chairman --MR. SPICER: No, I get it. And you're -- I understand who he is. Thank you. I'm well aware of Paul, I read it out yesterday. But the point that I'm making is, when you use a term like ""associate,"" and you use all of these subjective terms, there's a reason that you're doing it, which is because you dont have anything concrete. If you do, come back to me and ask, ""does anyone in the White House,"" ""is anyone in the transition."" But when you throw out a vague term like that, it's a catch-all. Can you be certain that no one who works for Time Life Turner has ever done anything illegal? I think that's a pretty broad way of casting a net -- or who has visited the building. I mean, that's what you're equivocally saying.Q  And also on the question of anonymous sources. I mean, you clearly have an issue with the way that they have been used among the intelligence officials. But people in this White House are often on background, they are often appearing as anonymous sources. Devin Nunes has used an anonymous source to present his intelligence. So why is it acceptable in that case but not in this case?MR. SPICER: First of all, there's two issues here. Number one is, what I have a problem with, and specific with the reporting that your networks did yesterday, is it was one subjective term after another. It was associates that may or may not be there. One subjective term after another, with no concrete proof that anything happened. When you use a term like ""associates,"" you dont even put a time frame around it. It's a little bit nebulous at best to suggest that somebody over and over again, making a claim the way you do and the narrative continues without any substantiation. When you're talking about Nunes, there's a reason that someone who's dealing with classified information can't go out into public and reveal certain things, because --Q  He said the information wasnt classified. MR. SPICER: No, that's not what he said. I dont think he ever said that anything wasnt classified. But there are certain things that the methods --Q  He said he was able to talk about it because it was not classified. MR. SPICER: No, no. He's able to talk about the subject; he cannot talk about the specifics, would be my suggestion -- that you can't talk about specifics of a case in terms of the sources and methods and the individuals. Because part of what's happened is a lot of the individuals who have been masked or unmasked are supposed to be classified. So just because something has gone into the public domain doesnt make it any less unclassified. That's the problem.Q  Sean, the nuclear posture review is commencing with this administration. Can you assure us that everything is on the table, including a lifting of a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing, and also developing new nuclear warheads?MR. SPICER: I dont have a full readout on that at this point. I'll either get back to you or have someone from the NSC get back to you.Katie.Q  Sean, you keep saying that there's not a plan B for healthcare. President Trump has repeatedly said that Republicans should just allow Obamacare to collapse because Democrats will own that, and therefore maybe we shouldnt do anything about it, but it's not fair to the American people to do that. Is the reason there's not a plan B is because the President's plan is to allow Obamacare to collapse?MR. SPICER: No. The President's plan is to pass the bill tonight, get it on to the Senate, and then sign a bill once it goes through conference. That's the President's plan, and that's why the President has been fighting for it. That's why the President has been trying to make it stronger and stronger every day. But I think he states a very clear reality, which is, if it doesnt do this, then it is a false choice to compare what we're doing with Obamacare because Obamacare is collapsing -- the premiums are skyrocketing, the choices are going down, the deductibles are going up. There is no equivalency. Something is failing, and we're actually trying to get rid of it to help the American people. And the point the President is making is, the politically expedient answer is to do nothing, but I think for the sake of the American people and the needs that they have in terms of healthcare, I think we owe it to them to do the right thing.Q  So a follow-up question: Who is the President holding accountable for a split in the Republican Party not being able to get this bill done, the struggle that it's taking to get the bill to the last minute? Is he holding Republican leadership, Paul Ryan, accountable for bringing a bill to the table without having consensus from the Freedom Caucus? Or is he holding the Freedom Caucus accountable for opposing it?MR. SPICER: I think right now we're not focused on blaming, we're focused on getting it done and winning.Q  Sean, you've criticized President Obama for the way he sold Obamacare, and there may be some validity to that.MR. SPICER: Thank you.Q  But candidate Trump, President-elect Trump, and now President Trump have been selling this legislation as coverage for everybody, lower premiums, lower deductibles, and better healthcare. Hasnt he put Republicans on the spot with this legislation by selling it that way?MR. SPICER: But it is. So, yes, thank you for the advertisement, I appreciate it. I think --Q  Can it do that?MR. SPICER: Of course, it can. I will do that. And that's what the point is. But I think that there has been -- A, I think there is some concern, as I mentioned earlier, about the timing. And I think we have continued to allay a lot of those concerns because of the rule that they are. And again, one of the things that is tough to explain to a lot -- or not tough to explain, but just the reality, is that if we dont do it the way that we're going to do it, we need 60 votes. And we're not going to get 60 votes in the Senate for this bill. The Democrats are united in stopping any progress being made on this.And so I think the point that we've had to make over and over again is, I get it. In a perfect world, if we had 60 votes, we could do this in a very, very different way and have a much more comprehensive legislative strategy, but in the same way that the Democrats use reconciliation, as do we, to undo it. And the reason that it is a three-pronged, three-phase approach is because of the nature that it has to get dealt with. And I think for a lot of folks, many of them are new to the process, many of them want to see it done in a different way. And I think we are trying to do it in the most responsible way, so that when it gets sent over the Senate, we dont have to have a huge parliamentary fight about what's Byrd-able or not. And that's -- while most people dont want to fully appreciate the nuances of that, it's a reality that we have to face if we actually want to get it done. And I think that makes a big, big difference.Peter.Q  Sean, yesterday when Chairman Nunes was here, we heard his comments. Today, behind closed doors, he apologized to the committee for not coming to them before he came to the press. And then he expressed regret for the way he handled this -- going public and going to the President before speaking to the members of his own committee. So I guess my question is, why was it appropriate? Why does the White House believe it was appropriate for Chairman Nunes to come and give this information to the President regarding an investigation about the President's own associates during the campaign?MR. SPICER: Well, two things. One is, it wasnt -- as has been asked before, to ask me why he did something -- he made a decision, he briefed -- hold on, you're getting there. I've seen enough of you, Peter. I know where you were going. (Laughter.) But the reality is, is that he made a decision. He briefed the press first. No one had a problem, by the way, in the press corps getting briefed before anybody else. He went down and he briefed your colleagues before he briefed anybody else. I dont hear too much crying about that. The reality is -- and then he made a statement and said, I'm going to come down to the White House and share this information with the President, as has just been noted. He didnt give us a heads-up. He told us he made an announcement, he said I'm coming down to the White House, asked for time to share this with the President. And I think part of the reason, to be clear and to your question, is specifically to say that there's a big difference between any discussion about what's going on in Russia and why this intelligence was picked up. His comments yesterday were very clear the intelligence and the information that he picked up had nothing to do with Russia. And I think he felt as though, according to his own words, that he had an obligation to make sure the President knew what he had discovered. That's it, plain and simple.Q  So to be clear, though, just because appearances matter on this, doesnt the White House have a concern that it creates the appearance that there was potentially interference by the President that he was included in conversations about the investigation because it was completed?MR. SPICER: My concern, to be perfectly blunt with you, is that it's always -- you seem to have an obsession with the process and not the substance. At some point, isnt --Q  Isn't the President --MR. SPICER: No, no, hold on, hold on.Q  The President is the one who wants the conclusion. He asked for it. MR. SPICER: I understand that.Q  So I'm asking, why didnt he ask for details before it was completed?MR. SPICER: Because as Chairman Nunes said -- and again, I'm just going to make it clear -- because he said that he wanted to make it very clear that the discussion and the revelations that he had were not -- did not regard anything to do with Russia, and he wanted the President to understand that. But there seems to be this obsession with the process: how did he get here, when did he go, what was the reaction. At some point, there should be a concern about the substance. That's a very serious revelation that he's made about what happened during the 2016 election with respect to our side and some of the things that happened.And at some point, I would implore, urge, beg some of you to use some of your investigative skills to look into what actually did happen, why did it happen, what was going on back there, who knew what when. But I think that there should be a similar concern, as opposed to figuring out whether he took a skateboard or a car here to exactly what happened and why it happened. And the reality is, is that whether he briefed us first or he briefed the Democratic members -- and that's up to him to decide -- the substance of what he shared should be troubling to everybody. And that's what I think is the important thing.Q  To follow on this thought, I want to ask you -- at CPAC, President Trump said, people shouldnt be allowed to use sources unless they use someones name. He said, it does tremendous disservice. This is following up on the conversation you started with Sarah earlier. So, I guess, the simple question is -- Chairman Nunes came out; he noted sources that he couldnt create and provide publicly. So why, when its politically advantageous, is that use of sourcing okay, but when its politically damaging, its not okay?MR. SPICER: No, I think theres a difference -- he came out and briefed people on what he knew at the time, and said he was literally going to get further briefs and would have further updates. Thats a big difference than reporting and making a serious allegation. In fact, he was doing quite the opposite. He was vindicating the President and saying there is something that you need to know about the substance of the allegations that are being made against you. And while that may or may not be the case, because some of what Ive seen --Q  But if he had not been vindicating him, wouldnt it have been just as important for the President to learn?MR. SPICER: Sure. And I think maybe he would have, and then you probably wouldnt have any concern with that, would you?Q  My question is to you.MR. SPICER: Margaret.Q  Following on that, two questions. You said again, the word vindicated. The President said he felt somewhat vindicated. Did he feel that having Chairman Nunes come down here helped his own credibility?MR. SPICER: I think its reassuring to know that what he discussed -- while, again, the Chairman made it very clear that hes not final in any of his processes, that what he had seen so far gave him grave concern -- or whatever the exact phrase before I get -- but to use the phrase that Chairman Nunes needed to say -- that he said. That it gave him concern and pause for what he had seen, and wanted the President to be aware of the activity that he had seen that occurred during the transition period. I think thats an important -- so I think, yes, the President did -- it was helpful for the President to know that the investigation, as he had asked for, was starting to bear fruit. And again, I think the equally important thing to note about yesterday was that part of what Chairman Nunes said was that it had nothing to do with these allegations and narrative about Russia. And I think that is a very, very important narrative to be clear on.Q  And are they going to meet again? And after conversations, since they spoke directly, did the President accept Chairman Nuness finding that there was no wiretapping at Trump Tower, which he said yesterday?MR. SPICER: Well, one, I dont think that -- the first one wasnt planned. Theres nothing planned for the Chairman to come down again. But second of all, I think I have and the President has very clearly explained that the tweet wasnt to be taken literally in the sense of the word wiretap -- that he was talking about surveillance in general. And yes, I think that when -- yes, once what Chairman Nunes said is that there was evidence of surveillance that occurred during the election. And I think that is important to note. Again, I think the obsession is with the process of how he got here, and what time he left, and who he briefed first, as opposed to the substance of this issue. But Im not going to -- all Ill tell you is the public comments that he made to you and your colleagues both here and up on Capitol Hill was that he was very concerned with the surveillance that he had seen and reports of surveillance and individuals who had been masked and unmasked during especially the transition period. I think that should express concern for a lot of individuals.Q  Sot the President is confident that Chairman Nunes can continue to lead this investigation, and, in his view, be impartial?MR. SPICER: Absolutely.Q  Because there have been some questions about that, including from Republicans.MR. SPICER: Yes. Thank you guys very much. Have a great one.END 2:35 P.M.

Trump Proclaims March 25, 2017, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy","GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY: A NATIONAL DAY OF CELEBRATION OFGREEK AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, 2017- - - - - - -BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICAA PROCLAMATIONThis year marks the 196th anniversary of Greek independence. Greek and American democracy are forever intertwined. American patriots built our Republic on the ancient Greeks' groundbreaking idea that the people should decide their political fates. As a young Nation, only recently free from Great Britain and securing its place on the world stage, America served as a source of inspiration for the revolutionary and freedom-loving Greeks who sought their own independence. Indeed, American citizens stood united with the people of Greece in its ""glorious cause"" of democracy and freedom, as expressed by Philadelphia's Franklin Gazette at the time.The ideas and ideals of the ancient Greeks altered the course of human history, from our own American Republic to the modern Greek state and many other nations. All those who believe in the refrain ""liberty and justice for all,"" and who are devoted to democracy and rule of law, owe a debt of gratitude to Greece and the foundational principles that took root in the ancient city-state of Athens.On this Greek Independence Day, we express our deep gratitude for Greece's enduring friendship in a region that has experienced great uncertainty. Greece is an important partner in our engagements throughout the international sphere. We look forward to strengthening our excellent bilateral defense relationship, and recognize the value and importance Greece's role as a strong ally in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.The American people join Greece in celebrating another milestone in its independent history, and we look forward to a future of shared success as partners and allies. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 25, 2017, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand thistwenty-fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.DONALD J.

426,2017-03-24,Remarks by President Trump on the Health Care Bill,"Oval Office4:26 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. We were very close, and it was a very, very tight margin. We had no Democrat support. We had no votes from the Democrats. They werent going to give us a single vote, so it's a very difficult thing to do.I've been saying for the last year and a half that the best thing we can do politically speaking is let Obamacare explode. It is exploding right now. Many states have big problems -- almost all states have big problems. I was in Tennessee the other day, and theyve lost half of their state in terms of an insurer; they have no insurer. And that's happened to many other places. I was in Kentucky the other day, and similar things are happening.So Obamacare is exploding. With no Democrat support, we couldn't quite get there. We were just a very small number of votes short in terms of getting our bill passed. A lot of people don't realize how good our bill was because they were viewing phase one. But when you add phase two -- which was mostly the signings of Secretary Price, who's behind me -- and you add phase three, which I think we would have gotten -- it became a great bill. Premiums would have gone down and it would have been very stable, it would have been very strong. But that's okay. But we're very, very close. And again, I think what will happen is Obamacare, unfortunately, will explode. It's going to have a very bad year. Last year you had over a 100 percent increases in various places. In Arizona, I understand it's going up very rapidly again, like it did last year; last year it was 116 percent. Many places, 50, 60, 70 percent, I guess it averaged -- whatever the average was -- very, very high.  And this year should be much worse for Obamacare.So what would be really good, with no Democrat support, is if the Democrats, when it explodes -- which it will soon -- if they got together with us and got a real healthcare bill. I would be totally up to do it. And I think that's going to happen. I think the losers are Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, because now they own Obamacare. They own it -- 100 percent own it. And this is not a Republican healthcare, this is not anything but a Democrat healthcare. And they have Obamacare for a little while longer, until it ceases to exist, which it will at some point in the near future. And just remember this is not our bill, this is their bill.Now, when they all become civilized and get together, and try and work out a great healthcare bill for the people of this country, we're open to it. We're totally open to it. I want to thank the Republican Party. I want to thank Paul Ryan -- he worked very, very hard, I will tell you that. He worked very, very hard. Tom Price and Mike Pence -- whos right here -- our Vice President, our great Vice President. Everybody worked hard. I worked as a team player and would have loved to have seen it passed. But again, I think you know I was very clear, I think there wasnt a speech I made, or very few where I didnt mention that perhaps the best thing that can happen is exactly what happened today, because we'll end up with a truly great healthcare bill in the future, after this mess known as Obamacare explodes.So I want to thank everybody for being here. It will go very smoothly, I really believe. I think this is something -- it certainly was an interesting period of time. We all learned a lot. We learned a lot about loyalty. We learned a lot about the vote-getting process. We learned a lot about some very arcane rules in, obviously, both the Senate and in the House. So it's been -- certainly for me, it's been a very interesting experience. But in the end, I think it's going to be an experience that leads to an even better healthcare plan. So thank you all very much. And I'll see you soon.Q  Mr. President, is it now your intention to go for tax reform? Or whats next on your priority list?THE PRESIDENT: We'll be going right now for tax reform, which we could have done earlier, but this really would have worked out better if we could have had some Democrat support. Remember this: We had no Democrat support. So now we're going to go for tax reform, which I've always liked.Q  And you're confident in Speaker Ryan's leadership and his ability to get things done?THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I am. I like Speaker Ryan. He worked very, very hard. A lot of different groups, he's got a lot of factions. And there's been a long history of liking and disliking, even within the Republican Party, long before I got here. But I've had a great relationship with the Republican Party. It seems that both sides like Trump, and that's good. And you see that, I guess, more clearly than anybody.But we've had a -- I'm not going to speak badly about anybody within the party. But certainly there's a big history. I think Paul really worked hard. And I would say that we will probably start going very, very strong for the big tax cuts and tax reform. That will be next.Q  Sir, is it fair to Americans to let Obamacare explode?THE PRESIDENT: Well, it's going to happen. There's not much you can do about it. It's going to -- bad things are going to happen to Obamacare. There's not much you can do to help it. I've been saying that for a year and a half. I said, look, eventually it's not sustainable. The insurance companies are leaving -- you know that. They're leaving one by one, as quick as you can leave. And you have states, in some cases, who will not be covered. So there's no way out of that.But the one thing that was happening, as we got closer and closer, everybody was talking about how wonderful it was, and now we'll go back to real life and people will see how bad it is. And it's getting much worse. You know, I said the other day, when President Obama left -- '17, he knew he wasnt going to be here; '17 is going to be a very, very bad year for Obamacare. Very, very bad. You're going to have explosive premium increases. And the deductibles are so high people dont even get to use it.So they'll go with that for a little while. And I honestly believe -- I know some of the Democrats, and they're good people -- I honestly believe the Democrats will come to us and say, look, let's get together and get a great healthcare bill or plan that's really great for the people of our country. And I think that's going to happen.Q  If you could have passed the bill in the House without any Democratic support, why do you think you werent able to craft a deal among the Republican Party?THE PRESIDENT: Well, we were very close. We were just probably anywhere from 10 to 15 votes short. Could have even been closer than that. You'll never know because you'll never know how they vote. But in the end, I think we would have been 10 votes, maybe closer. And it was very hard to get almost 100 percent. You're talking about a very, very large number of votes -- among any group. And we were very close to doing it. But when you get no votes from the other side -- meaning the Democrats -- it's really a difficult situation.Q  Will you reach out to the Democrats now?THE PRESIDENT: No, I think we have to let Obamacare go its way for a little while, and we'll see how things go. I'd love to see it do well, but it can't. I mean, it can't. It's not a question of, gee -- I hope it does well. I would love it to do well. I want great healthcare for the people of this nation. But it can't do well. It's imploding, and soon will explode, and it's not going to be pretty.So the Democrats dont want to see that, so they're going to reach out when they're ready. And whenever they're ready, we're ready.Q  Do you feel betrayed by the House Freedom Caucus at all? They seemed to be the most difficult to get.THE PRESIDENT: No, I'm not betrayed. They're friends of mine. I'm disappointed because we could have had it. So I'm disappointed. I'm a little surprised, to be honest with you. We really had it. It was pretty much there within grasp. But I'll tell you what's going to come out of it is a better bill -- I really believe a better bill. Because there were things in this bill I didnt particularly love. And I think it's a better bill. You know, both parties can get together and do real healthcare. That's the best thing. Obamacare was rammed down everyone's throat -- 100 percent Democrat. And I think having bipartisan would be a big, big improvement. So, no, I think that this is going to end up being a very good thing. I'm disappointed, but they're friends of mine, and they got -- this is a very hard time for them and a very hard vote. But they're very good people.Q  You mentioned that there were things in this bill that you didnt necessarily love. What specifically are those?THE PRESIDENT: Well, I think we could have things that I would have liked more. And if we had bipartisan, I really think we could have a healthcare bill that would be the ultimate. And I think the Democrats know that also. And some day, in the not--too-distant future, that will happen. And I never said -- I guess I'm here, what, 64 days? I never said repeal and replace Obamacare -- you've all heard my speeches -- I never said repeal it and replace it within 64 days. I have a long time. But I want to have a great healthcare bill and plan -- and we will. It will happen. And it won't be in the very distant future. I really believe there will be some Democrat support, and that will happen, and it will be an even better bill. I think this was a very good bill. I think it will be even better the next time around. I dont think that's going to be in too long a period of time.Q  Anything specifically you want to see changed going from this bill to the next bill?THE PRESIDENT: No, I mean, I dont want to speak about specifics, but there are things I could have -- I would have liked even more. But I feel overall this was a very, very good bill. And I thought Tom Price -- Dr. Tom Price -- who really is amazing on healthcare, his knowledge -- I thought he did a fantastic job. Same with Mike Pence. I think these two guys -- they worked so hard and really did a fantastic job.Thank you very much. Thank you. END 4:36 P.M.

427,2017-03-24,Remarks by the President in a Meeting with Medal of Honor Recipients,"Oval Office4:11 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. This is a great honor for me. These are very, very brave people standing behind me. And we're here today to mark Medal of Honor Day, and it is my great privilege and high honor to welcome 25 Medal of Honor recipients to our White House. Very special honor, thank you all very much. (Applause.) I can say officially they are much braver than I am, okay? (Laughter.) Do you agree with that, General?GENERAL MATTIS: I do, Mr. President. (Laughter.)A MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT: That's the right answer. (Laughter.)THE PRESIDENT: It is the right answer.One-third of the nations 75 living Medal of Honor recipients are with us. So its really -- that's a great tribute to all of us, a great tribute to our nation.Each of you has risen above and beyond the call of duty in defense of our country, our people, and our flag. You have poured out your hearts, your sweat, and your tears like few others, and your blood -- most importantly your blood for the United States of America. We thank you, very much thank you. You are the soul of our nation, and a grateful republic salutes you. Constantly we're saluting you. We have great admiration and respect, believe me. I know what you've been through.We write your names and deeds in our national memory, and we will forever remember -- forever, forever and ever -- those who did not come home, but who died for the cause of freedom.I want to thank the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation for preserving the incredible stories of our Medal of Honor heroes for future generations. Done a great job.In this room hangs the portrait of our 26th President, Theodore Roosevelt. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courage alongside his band of Rough Riders at the Battle of San Juan Hill. You know about the Rough Riders, right? Right? Absolutely. His medal, which is also displayed here, is a reminder of how blessed we truly are to live in the land of heroes. And you are our greatest heroes.To all of those gathered here today, and to all of those warriors who could not be with us, we thank you. Your acts of valor inspire us -- and they show us that there is always someone on the night watch to ensure a bright sun rises on America each and every morning.God bless you. God bless our military and God bless the United States of America.I want to just thank you very much for being here. Its my great honor. (Applause.)And as you know, we have David who is doing a great job at the VA. Already tremendous signs are happening, positive signs. And we have General Mattis who is doing a great job out there on the field, and you see a big difference. A lot of difference taking place over the last six weeks. So I want to thank General Mattis, too. And thank you all, and its great to have met you.Oh, look at this.A MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT: Mr. President, on behalf of the Medal of Honor Society, Id like to present a book Portraits of Valor, which contains all the signatures of the men in the room here, plus about 200 Medal of Honor recipients.THE PRESIDENT: That is very nice. That is very nice. (Applause.)I know these folks would like to stand behind me when I do this, but I don't want to put them in a political situation, so we're going to talk a little politics. And I think it might be unfair to them, so Ill ask them to -- they're going to go over to the Roosevelt Room, and well see you a little bit later. We're going to do -- unless the press doesn't want to talk politics? (Laughter.) No? Okay, well, they do. But I want to thank you all very much.END 4:15 P.M. EDT",20596.72,-59.86000000000058,5828.74,11.050000000000182,2343.98,-1.9800000000000182
428,2017-03-24,Daily Press Briefing by Press Secretary Sean Spicer - #28,"James S. Brady Press Briefing Room1:15 P.M. EDTMR. SPICER: Good afternoon, everyone. Theres a lot going on today, so Im going to keep this on the briefer side.This morning, the President announced the official approval of the presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. The last administration spent eight years delaying this enormous investment in American energy independence. President Trump is moving this project forward in just eight weeks. And just as he promised, its an even better deal for the American people than before he took office. This project will directly generate an estimated 16,100 jobs, according to the State Department -- all without spending a dime of taxpayer money. In many ways, this project represented everything that was wrong with the infrastructure permitting of the United States. TransCanada spent an incredible amount of resources attempting to comply with government regulations, only to be denied and delayed for political reasons. But the days of pointless government bureaucracy holding up progress and production have ended. By simply getting excessive, duplicative regulations out of the way, we can make infrastructure projects more attractive -- a more attractive prospect for private investors, and encourage even more projects like this one.Immediately following the announcement by TransCanada, the President announced that Charter Communications has committed to investing $25 billion here in the United States and hiring an additional 20,000 American workers over the next four years.Charter Communications is truly an example of how American leadership can turn a downturn entity into an amazing success.Five years ago, Charter Communications was a struggling company that had slowly emerged from bankruptcy. Today, thanks to hard work and great leadership of Chairman and CEO Tom Rutledge, it is the fastest-growing television, Internet, and voice company in the nation. And, most importantly, as Charter grew, American jobs grew, as they brought back many jobs that had previously been shipped overseas. Today, Charter is also committed to completely ending its offshore call centers, basing 100 percent of them in the United States. Together, the TransCanada and Charter Communications announcement demonstrate the new economic model of what the President called The American Model. By slashing job-killing regulations and reducing government burdens and lowering taxes, we will make it easier for all businesses to grow right here at home, generating jobs and boosting our economy by getting government out of the way.Following these big announcements, the President had lunch with Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. He was joined by Speaker Paul Ryan -- I'll get to in a second on that. Later in the afternoon, the President will host a Greek Independence Day celebration. And as I mentioned yesterday, at 4 oclock he will meet with about two dozen Medal of Honor recipients to honor Medal of Honor Day, which is technically tomorrow. Hes honored to be hosting these great men and women of our Armed Services, the greatest force for peace and justice the world has ever known.And obviously, later today, the House will be voting on the American Health Care Act. The current vote is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. The President has been working the phones and having in-person meetings since the American Health Care Act was introduced. Hes left everything on the field when it comes to this bill. The President and congressional Republicans promised the American people that they would repeal and replace this broken system. Obamacares Washington-driven, one-size-fits-all plan had seven years to prove its case, and look what its left us with:Skyrocketing premiums -- on average, premiums for Obamacare benchmark plans increased 25 percent in 2017. Unaffordable deductibles -- the two most popular Obamacare health plans have average deductibles equivalent to 10 percent and 6 percent of the median American household income. With these high deductibles, many people have, technically, insurance, but nothing that they can afford to use. Fewer choices -- one in five Americans have only one insurer offering Obamacare through exchanges. And, of course, higher taxes.Key conservative groups like the Tea Party Express and the American Conservative Union have added themselves to a long list of organizations expressing their support for the American Health Care Act because they know its our chance, after the American people have spent years suffering, to finally repeal and replace the nightmare of Obamacare. The President looks forward to seeing the House Republicans join with these influential voices and vote in favor of the American Health Care Act. The President, as I mentioned, had Speaker Ryan come up here and visit with him to update him on the bill. They are continuing to discuss the way forward on this. The Speaker is updating him on his efforts. As I mentioned to you, the President has been working throughout the week on this, calling early -- starting early in the morning and working till late at night, calling with members, visiting members. By our count, over 120 members have personally had a visit, call, or meeting here at the White House in the past few days. This is an extraordinary feat. The President and his team have committed everything they can to making this thing happen. And the Speaker is going to continue to update him on the way forward.Finally, a few administrative notes here at the end. Yesterday, senior-level United States and Israeli delegations concluded four days of intensive talks with a particular focus on concrete, near-term measures to improve the overall climate in order to advance the prospects of a genuine and lasting peace between Israel and Palestine. The United States delegation was led by Jason Greenblatt, Special Representative for International Negotiation, and included representatives of the NSC and the Department of State.A principal focus of the discussion was specific measures that could have a meaningful impact on the economic environment in the West Bank and Gaza, allowing the Palestinians to more fully realize their economic potential.The two delegations also discussed Israeli settlement construction. The fact that both governments dedicated such senior delegations for so many days reflects the close cooperation between these countries and the importance that both assign to this vital task.Last night, the President announced his intention to nominate several key additional people to the administration, including Althea Coat-zee to be Deputy Administrator of the Small Business Administration; William Francis Hagerty IV to be ambassador to Japan; Robert Sumwalt III to be a member of the National Transportation Safety Board. And also this morning, of note, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia upheld the Presidents revised executive order protecting the nation from foreign people who seek to do us harm into the United States. We're pleased with this ruling, which found the plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. As the court correctly notes in its opinion, the Presidents order falls well within his legal authority to protect the nation's security. Were confident the President's fully lawful and necessary action will ultimately be allowed to move forward through the rest of the system -- court system.In terms of the schedule for this weekend, the President will spend a working weekend here in Washington, and we'll update you with further details regarding his schedule.With that, I'll get to your questions. Steve.Q  Sean, is it your understanding that you don't have the votes to pass the healthcare legislation? Is that the message that Speaker Ryan delivered today? And if so, what lessons do you draw from this process?MR. SPICER: Well, I think the Speaker is currently having a conversation with him to talk about where that vote count stands. Hes working with the members of -- you know the President made a sell. They had the Tuesday Group here. There were 17 members here; 16 walked out as a yes. I think we've had a group of members that we've continued to have a conversation with and try to make -- frankly, at this point, it's not a question of negotiating anymore. It's understanding the greater good that's at hand. The President understands this is it. We had this opportunity to change the trajectory of healthcare to help improve -- put a healthcare system in place and to end the nightmare that Republicans have campaigned on called Obamacare. I noted yesterday it was the seventh-year anniversary of Obamacare. We have an opportunity to make sure that was the last one, and the question is, do members realize this opportunity.Theres no question in my mind at least that the President and the team here have left everything on the field. He has called every member that had a question or concern, tried to, to the extent possible, take into consideration ideas that would strengthen the bill. And it's now going to be up to the members of the House to decide whether or not they want to follow through on the promise to that.But we're going to continue to work with the Speaker and the leadership there to see where the votes are. We're getting closer and closer, but you need to get to 216. And theyre starting four hours of debate. I expect a vote somewhere around 3:30-4 oclock hour. We'll see where we go.Hunter.Q  Thank you, Sean. We're hearing that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell wanted to do a clean repeal and then replace over time. In retrospect, would that have been a better approach? And in general, do you think Paul Ryan has handled this well?MR. SPICER: I dont know that that's entirely the case. I know that this was a joint effort. This is something that the House determined in terms of the three-pronged approach that we had. So I dont know that I necessarily agree with the assessment of how that happened.Q  And, in general, is the White House happy with how Paul Ryan has handled this?MR. SPICER: I think the Speaker has done everything he can. He's worked really closely with the President. I think at the end of the day -- I said this yesterday -- you can't force people to vote. But I think we've given them every single reason to fulfill every pledge that they've made, and I think this is the right thing to do.Maggie. I dont want you to live-Tweet this thing.Q  Thank you, Sean. What is the White House's view if this does not pass and there arent the votes? What does this mean going forward for other pieces of the Presidents agenda -- tax reform being the big one?MR. SPICER: Look, I've said it before, I dont think you can tie any of these together. That's just not -- I think there's a huge appetite for tax reform. And I'm not trying to juxtapose anything to do with today's vote or not. I think it will be great to see it put forward. The President has put a lot of time and effort into this, and I think he's made a strong case as to why this has to happen, and I think we've worked with the House.If we dont get -- regardless of what happens today -- and I still feel optimistic that the Speaker and the President and the Vice President -- we've got a team that's been up on the Hill most of today -- they're going to continue to try to get every vote they can. But that doesnt mean -- whether it's immigration or tax reform, there's still a huge appetite out there.Q  Just to be clear, I mean, if this fails today, is the President done with healthcare?MR. SPICER: So negative. (Laughter.) Q  That's what we're hearing.MR. SPICER: That's what you're hearing? Well, I havent heard that yet, so why dont we continue with a very positive, optimistic Friday. The sun is coming out. (Laughter.) I feel really good. So we're going to continue to work as late as we can to get the votes. And as I said, the upside is that we continue to pick up votes, people continue to say that they want to -- the question is, can we get to 2016.But make no mistake about it, the President made it clear last night -- this is it. You have an opportunity to do what you've told the American people, the commitment that we as a party have made, but this is your chance to do what we've done. We've listened, we've incorporated, we've updated in every way possible. I dont think -- when you look at legislative efforts, I think the President has given it his all. And I think it shocked a lot of people, frankly, how very, very detail-oriented, how personal it was for him -- calling members as early as 6:00 a.m. in the morning and going to 11 o'clock at night the last several nights, sitting down, meeting after meeting with them, coming back and revising it, having his team back and forth. Everything is out there.And I think each of these members needs to make the decision, whether or not they believe that they've -- at some point, you can only do so much, is what I would honestly tell you. And I think everything that we could possibly do to listen to members, to get their concerns in this piece of legislation, to make it as strong as possible for the American people has been done.Q  But is the President comfortable then with Obamacare continuing? And what does he say to his supporters?MR. SPICER: No, he's not. I mean, of course, he's not.Q  I mean, they voted for him with the promise that he would repeal this.MR. SPICER: I mean, I'm not even sure where to start with that. No, he's not, which is why he's literally put as much effort as he has into repealing this. But he's made it clear that this is our moment, this is our opportunity to do it, but it is now up to members to make that decision whether or not they want to be part of this effort to repeal Obamacare. And if they dont -- and I think for a lot of the -- you saw the President's tweet this morning -- I think for a lot of these members who life is as important as well, this is your opportunity. But it's ultimately them that have to go down in the floor and cast that vote. And I think we've been able to cast a bunch of votes over the past couple years when you knew a President wouldnt sign it. You have a President that's going to sign the bill if you pass it. And now is that time.Zeke.Q  Some months ago at the Republican National Convention, the President said -- I alone can fix it. Throughout the entire campaign, his message to his voters, the American people, was, he's a businessman, he knows how to get deals done, he knows how to break the gridlock in Washington, he's the ""closer"" is what you said earlier this week. If this vote does go down, what does this say about the President? Is the President humbled by this process? And will he readjust -- how will he readjust the administration going forward?MR. SPICER: Let's not -- like I said to Jill, I'm still optimistic. I feel like we're continuing to work hard. But at the end of the day, you can't force somebody to do something. I think there's nobody that objectively can look at this effort and say the President didnt do every single thing he possibly could, with his team, to get every vote possible. And I think that's why I still feel good about this.But we are where we are, and members have got to make that decision for themselves. This is the final hour to make that decision.Blake.Q  Sean, is it under any consideration to pull the bill at all between now and then?MR. SPICER: You guys are so negative.Q  Well, there's reports out there that --MR. SPICER: I understand. But there are reports out there -- the Speaker and the President are talking now. The Leader and the Whip are doing their vote counts. The debate is ongoing. We're going to continue -- we are proceeding with a 3:30 p.m. vote as scheduled.John.Q  Take me through some of the -- if you dont mind -- the thinking yesterday when the bill was pulled and then the President had made the decision -- or his team, they went to the Hill saying, there's going to be a vote today. At what point did he make that calculation? Why did he make that calculation? Can you bring us through some of that thinking?MR. SPICER: Yeah, I mean, there's a couple of things. One is, I think we wanted to be as open as possible with the vote. Having it on the current trajectory last night, it was going into the wee hours of the morning, and I dont think that that -- for all that we've talked about, that wasnt the appropriate way to vote. I think we decided to work with the House and ask that they postpone and make sure that it was done in the light of day. But I think that he's had enough discussions. And it is not about improving the deal anymore. I think he has taken into consideration every member's thoughts and concerns, and relayed those to the House. And I think to the extent that this balance of trying to get to 216, in this case, is such that there are some people that come in with ideas and say, if you do that to get your vote, I'm going to give up 26, or to get these three, I'm going give up 12. And I think we have struck the right balance right now and incorporated it, and it's the strongest possible bill. But he's going to continue to work as hard as he can until the very end.Charlie.Q  How important is a live vote to the White House and to the President to see who's on the side and who's not?MR. SPICER: We've seen the whip counts. Mr. Scalise has done a phenomenal job with Leader McCarthy of -- we know where the vote count stands. So we dont need a live vote to tell us where the votes are. People have been pretty straightforward with where they are and what their outstanding issues are.Q  The President and the Speaker are meeting right now. Do you know -- can you tell us anything about the character of that meeting, or what exactly they're looking at going forward?MR. SPICER: Well, they're discussing, they're not looking. They're sitting down and talking about where it stands, some of the outstanding issues, and whether they're onesies or twosies or fives -- what are the concerned and outstanding issues of some of the blocs and some of the individuals, and having a discussion on that.Anita.Q  If the bill doesnt pass -- MR. SPICER: There's somebody that's going to ask when it passes, and you can --Q  Okay, well, do you want to have a briefing right after the vote?MR. SPICER: No.Q  Okay. (Laughter.) MR. SPICER: All right, score one for you. (Laughter.) Q  If the bill doesnt pass, does the President still have confidence in the Speaker?MR. SPICER: I think he answered that question earlier today.Q  Well, does he think that he should step down if it doesnt get a vote?MR. SPICER: He answered that question earlier, and he said he did. So, asked and answered.Q  And then, logistically today, after the vote, whatever happens, how will we get a response from you all?MR. SPICER: Electronically or verbally, but one of the two. Peter.Q  Thank you, Sean. This is the President's first foray into, let's say, the sausage-making process, so to speak. Has he reflected at all on the experience? I mean, how does he feel it differs from, for example, negotiating a real estate deal, a business deal? Is it more complicated? Is it trickier? What's his feeling about this?MR. SPICER: I think we'll have plenty of time to reflect on it after we do this, so I know that -- I'll just leave it at that for now.Kristen.Q  Thanks. Without prejudging the outcome of the vote --MR. SPICER: Thank you. (Laughter.) Q  -- does the President in any way regret pursuing healthcare first, given how complicated it has been?MR. SPICER: No. I think if you think about it legislatively, in order to maximize -- and I know for most people it doesnt make a ton of sense, but the savings that you achieve through the first reconciliation of healthcare, which we're doing through the 2017 budget process, which still continues, allows us to utilize the savings in that process to maximize additional tax reform measures that will start in the FY2018 reconciliation process.So while that sounds like a ton of inside-baseball gobbledygook, the reality is, is that in order to maximize tax reform both on the corporate side, to make our businesses more competitive and to give individuals, especially middle-class Americans, more tax relief -- doing this in that way maximizes the amount of savings that you can use for the second reconciliation package, which would be tax reform. Doing it the first way, you can do -- but again, you're not going to achieve the full potential that you could if you did it the way that is happening now.But that being said, I mean, it's not a question of -- we all knew how big this was -- it's one-fifth of the economy -- and what it took. The issue is, is that I think the disparate interests that are there, and some of the process-explaining, if you will -- the understanding -- the way that this is happening, and I think, legislatively, its complicated. And for a lot of folks that just understand, why cant you do it all in one fell swoop? Whats the Byrd Rule? Whats reconciliation? Why do you have to do it in three phases? I think, for a lot of people, that is a little bit complicated to understand. And its not just a question of understanding. I think one of the other things that the President and the team have found is that theres a lot of issues where people are wondering, well, if I vote for this how can I guarantee that I get something in phase two -- which is the administrative pieces that Secretary Price would institute. And then third is -- well, you know, the legislative things that will take 60 votes, they complete the overall package -- you know, how do I have -- and so theres a lot of -- the comprehensive nature of this makes it very complicated. And I think thats a lot different. Normally, you have one bill that sails through, and it deals with all of these things, and you can roll it all in. If someone has an amendment, you add it in. In this process, were having to have all these one-off discussions about, you know, will the Senate accept this if you put it in; if you put it in, will they -- not only will they accept it, but will the Byrd Rule take place and kick out the whole thing. That complicates this probably like nothing else.Q  Understood. Just to put a fine point on it, though, was it his initial ask to do healthcare first, or did House Speaker Paul Ryan say, I think this is --MR. SPICER: I think was something that, during the transition, we sat down and gamed out in coordination with the House in terms of what should go first and why. But again, its not a question of just what should go first, its a question of if you dont do it first, do you lose some of the potential in savings that you would achieve through the second reconciliation.Q  Wouldnt it have been wiser to try to work with the Freedom Caucus, for example, on something like infrastructure reform to build up some goodwill with that caucus, and then come back to something more complicated? MR. SPICER: No, I think -- look, Kristen, weve talked about this since 2010. Every Republican, with the exception of probably a handful, has campaigned from dog catcher on up that they would do everything they could to repeal and replace Obamacare. And I think to get in and say, hey, you should have done something else wouldnt be fair to the American people who have said, okay, Ill vote for you but I want you to fulfill this pledge.Q  And just finally, does the buck stop with him on this?MR. SPICER: Well, I mean -- like I said earlier, you cant force someone to vote a certain way. I think, in the sense that has he done every single thing, has he pulled out every stop, has he called every member, has he tweaked every tweak, has he done every single thing he can possibly, and used every minute of every day thats possible to get this thing through, then the answer is yes. Has the team put everything out there? Have we left everything on the field? Absolutely.But at the end of the day, this isnt a dictatorship, and weve got to expect members to ultimately vote to -- you know, how they will according to what they think. But I think theyre -- as the President made clear, theyre the ones who have to go back and answer to their constituents why they didnt fulfill a pledge that they made.Q  Non-healthcare question for you. Regarding these documents that Devin Nunes says show incidental intelligence collection of identifying information about people associated with the Trump campaign, can you categorically rule out that Chairman Nunes received or was alerted to these documents from someone at the White House?MR. SPICER: Im not aware of where he got the documents from. I dont know.Q  Can you rule out that it came from the White House?MR. SPICER: I cant -- I don't know where he got them from. He didnt state it. So I dont have anything for you. And so I cannot say anything more than I don't know at this point.Cecilia.Q  So if the President has done everything he can possibly do, and the Speaker has done everything he can possibly do, the team has put everything on the table, who is to blame right now for this hold-up, in your eyes?MR. SPICER: Well, again, lets wait and see how this thing -- Im not assigning blame.Q  Well, but you wanted a vote even last night or this morning, so there is a stall. So from last night to this morning --MR. SPICER: No, no, no, we did want a vote last night, and I think, as I have mentioned, as we got into the evening hours, the idea wasnt to bury this at 12:00 a.m. or 1:00 a.m. in the morning.Q  Initially, you were asking for one yesterday, and there was a statement from your press office that asked for one this morning. MR. SPICER: No, no -- and Im not backing away from that. We wanted a vote yesterday. But as the process went on, we realized that that vote would occur in -- probably, actually, into today, in terms of like calendar-wise, and that doing it at 1:00 a.m., 2:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m. in the morning was not something that would be in keeping with what we had promised.Q  So who is to blame for the stall right now? Is it the Freedom Caucus? Is it --MR. SPICER: I think its not a blame. Right now, its a question of getting all these members together and dealing with all -- I mean, youve seen the activity. Youve seen the members go back and forth. Right now, were still in that active discussion phase with trying to figure out who we can get on board and whether or not we can move forward.But this is -- were not there yet.Q  But you put this ultimatum out there. Is the President, right now, still confident that he can see this bill through -- that you will repeal and replace Obamacare?MR. SPICER: The President is confident that we have done every single thing possible, made the case, updated it, added and done everything to listen to the concerns and to do everything that fulfills the promises that we and members have made with the American people.John.Q  Thank you, Sean. Without prejudging the outcome of the vote today, but focusing on your comments and the Presidents, saying this would be a vote against life if people vote against it --MR. SPICER: Right.Q  -- several Republican members said they did not want the vote on Planned Parenthood in this particular bill. Congressman John Faso of New York was particularly outspoken. Did anything come up in the negotiation or from the White House saying they guarantee a separate vote on Planned Parenthood and leave it out of the bill?MR. SPICER: Im not aware of that, John. Im not aware that that happened.Q  The White House -- from your tone and the Presidents, the White House wanted the Planned Parenthood vote in?MR. SPICER: Id have to go back and look at -- theres a lot of discussions that go on. I honestly can't remember how or when that came up.Q  The other thing I wanted to ask was that the last two members who announced they were no -- Chris Smith and Frank LoBiondo, Republicans of New Jersey -- both cited the number of Medicaid recipients in their district as their premier reason. Congressman LoBiondo said in three counties, 30 percent of his constituents were on Medicaid, and he wanted no damage. Was there anything discussed on Medicaid? Was it on the table in the negotiations?MR. SPICER: Well, I know that that there was a discussion about the expansion of Medicaid and some of the work requirements with respect to able-bodied Americans who are receiving that. But I would say this, John -- one of the things that -- not member-specific to either of the members from New Jersey -- is that members have to understand that the current system is unsustainable. So if you vote no today, then what is your alternative, and what do you want?Because right now theres a lot of folks that have said they're going to vote no, which is their prerogative, but at the end of the day, the current Obamacare system will collapse on its own. And so the question that they have to ask themselves or that they are going to be asked by their constituents is, then what is your alternative? Because right now this is the choice that will save the system. The other choice is to do nothing, and that will -- that is going to collapse the system. Eamon.Q  Thanks, Sean. The stock market has been largely looking at this as a proxy for how you're going to do on your tax cut proposal. Would you be able to say what the lessons learned here are about how this was handled that might apply to the tax cut proposal?MR. SPICER: Look, Eamon, Ive discussed this earlier. Im not going to start getting a lessons learned while we're in the middle of debate of a current bill. We'll have plenty of time -- if you want to stop by over the weekend, we can talk about -- (laughter) -- to sit down with you on that. But again, we're not -- right now we're focused on getting the votes. The House has a vote scheduled. That's what our focus is -- not to figure out -- well have plenty of time for that.Jen.Q  Is the President going to just simply wash his hands of this today if this doesn't go his way?MR. SPICER: Look, we're not -- the President is going to wash his hands several times, but I don't know -- (laughter).Q  The central campaign promise of the President of the United States --MR. SPICER: I understand that, and so what -- I get it. So slow down. Lets turn on C-SPAN and all watch this together, and then we can discuss what happened.Jen.Q  Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was talking this morning about doing tax reform by the August recess. Do you think that that's a reasonable timeline? And why the rush? Are there any lessons learned from this healthcare debate?MR. SPICER: Again, I think tax reform is something that weve talked about. Theres plenty of time. I think its a goal, and I think its an ambitious one and I think its one that we're going to try to stick to. But lets get by today, and then well lay it out.But I think tax reform is something that the President is very committed to. You've seen him very publicly in the last couple of open events talk about how excited he is to move on once this is done to tax reform. Because he understands both sides of this -- that the business piece of this -- we are so uncompetitive when it comes to our other worldly competitors in terms of our tax rate, and yet when we have these discussions about keeping companies from either shipping jobs overseas or growing -- bringing back jobs to America, the two things that come up over and over again are our tax rate and our regulatory system. And I think he understands that on the tax front, we can be a lot more competitive with the rest of the world in growing American jobs here at home and, frankly, expanding manufacturing if we lower that, but also that the American middle class desperately needs and wants a tax break, and I think the more that we can do with that -- so this is something that I think we're going to be continuing to work on, and well have more on that later.Trey.Q  Sean, how much credit will the President take for the outcome of this healthcare bill?MR. SPICER: Im going to refer you to like the last eight people. Lets see where we go from here.Q  Quick follow-up?MR. SPICER: Yes.Q  Is the White House still as confident as they were earlier in this week, and is the President still as confident as he was earlier in the week that this healthcare bill will pass?MR. SPICER: I would suggest to you its -- my answer that I said to Kristen is that we are confident that we have done everything, and it is now up to voters. The President -- we -- the President called for a vote, and respectfully -- obviously, its not up to us, but the reason that he asked Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy to call for a vote is we've done everything. We've done every single thing that -- every meeting, every call, every discussion, every idea has been out there, adjudicated, listened to. And I think that now is the time for the vote. And so we're a couple hours away, and lets see where we go.Q  -- level of confidence remain?MR. SPICER: I think in the sense of what we did, yes.Peter.Q  Sean, the President can order every surveillance transcript that mentions himself or his associates in regards to Russia for the investigation that he called for to be brought to his desk at any time. Has he done that?MR. SPICER: No.Q  So yesterday you were asked specifically -- you said that the concerns should be less about the process and more about the substance. I asked because that would be one way to get directly to the substance. On the substance, Devin Nunes said initially that he -- there was evidence that clearly showed that the President-elect and his team were at least monitored. Then today he said --, asked if Trump or his associates were monitored or mentioned, he said, we don't know. We wont know until we actually receive all the documentation.The President said hes somewhat vindicated. So given the fact that Devin Nunes doesn't actually know if the President was monitored or whether he was even mentioned, what is he vindicated by?MR. SPICER: Well, I think that there has been an acknowledgement that there are documents out there showing that people were surveilled or monitored to some degree.Q  They could have exclusively been foreigners, Devin Nunes concedes.MR. SPICER: Devin Nunes also made it clear that hes going to have a hearing later next week with several members of the intelligence community and calling others back. And so lets wait and see --Q  Well, what is the President vindicated by?MR. SPICER: The President said he felt somewhat vindicated because I think that there is an acknowledgement that hes -- that as we proceed down this discussion, it continues to show that there was something there, and that despite the constant discussion about the process --Q  But he said we don't -- we wont know.MR. SPICER: Hold on, Peter. I understand. I get this is-- I understand that. And he also said that hes going to have a hearing and hes going to call the people back, and hes waiting for the documents. So lets wait and let that process evolve.Q  Thank you, Sean. A couple questions. First about Keystone. What changed? It seemed like it took forever in covering the Obama administration for this thing to finally get over the finish line. It never did. And relatively quickly -- less than 65 days in -- its finally made its way over the finish line. What changed, especially with respect to the State Departments view of the Keystone XL pipeline? And is it your opinion that it would be good to hear from the President -- win, lose, or draw -- after what we learned today vis--vis healthcare reform?MR. SPICER: So, simply put, on Keystone, it was a priority. I mean, the President came in, he signed an executive order on it. He had talked about it during the campaign and he made it a priority. He made it a priority for his team here at the White House to get it done -- not only the jobs but incorporating U.S. steel and -- there was a lot of things. But I dont think its any simpler than he made it a priority for him, his team, this administration, the Department of State, and others -- and thats it. He recognizes the importance of that to both energy and to jobs and our economy, and simply got it done. And Ill leave it up to the President, once we go forward, to see how it goes.Margaret.Q  Sean, as a dealmaker, why does the President feel that this take-it-or-leave-it approach is the right one on healthcare?MR. SPICER: Because I think he has done -- I mean, at some point youve listened to everybody, youve gotten all other ideas, youve gone back and forth, you have incorporated them, youve assuaged them in some way, shape, or form; youve updated the bill -- and a lot of times, its the same people coming back over and over again. And you go, okay, Ive listened to you, Ive taken your ideas. At some point, we either have a deal or we dont. And I think thats where the President finally drew the line and said weve been having this discussion, weve had the meetings, and weve done everything possible to address the concerns and ideas and opinions that people have brought up. And I mean, I dont think you can say it any simpler. I think he has done every single thing possible, and you end up, at some point, finding yourself going around and around and saying, okay, lets just -- lets call the vote.Q  But isnt there a political cost to a collapse, potentially?MR. SPICER: I think that, at some point, theres a political cost to dragging this out, as well, and saying, lets just keep letting it go. And I think thats where -- you know, we came to a decision that it had gotten as far as it can go.Kaitlan.Q  If theres a collapse, though, isnt there a cost that the President will, at some point, have to pay for? If its either --MR. SPICER: In terms of what?Q  The collapse that you have been predicting --MR. SPICER: No, I think that -- look, remember -- look, this is --Q  Besides the upcoming election in 2018, Im talking about economic impact, all the impact on the states -- there will be a cost.MR. SPICER: I get it, and I think that well have to look at the landscape. But at some point -- you know, I think right now Democrats made a decision during this debate that they wanted to stick by Obamacare. I think, at some point -- the President has talked about this -- that this is going to collapse. And lets see where this thing heads, but I think, right now, we have a plan on the table that allows for a solution that will address all of the concerns that, frankly, were initially brought up as far as what the Affordable Care Act was supposed to do.Kaitlan.Q  So if you know what the vote counts are right now, and theres no discussion of pulling the healthcare bill, and it gets closer to 3:30 p.m. and you still dont have the votes, why vote? MR. SPICER: Im not going to discuss our strategy. I mean --Q  But you see what Im saying, right?MR. SPICER: I do.Q  If you know what the votes are and you know that you dont have the votes for it to pass, why vote?MR. SPICER: I understand your question. Im just not going to comment on our strategy. I think the President and the Speaker are going to have a discussion about where those votes are and what some of the members needs are, and well take it from there.Athena.Q  You talked about all the work that the President and his team have put into this -- the early-morning calls, late calls. The other day, one of the members of Congress who was here to meet with the President -- Congressman McHenry -- called -- said, were bringing him to the closer. You embraced that nickname from the podium. Whatever happens today, do you still feel comfortable calling the President the closer when it comes to deal-making on all this?MR. SPICER: Look, I think I said to Christian and a couple others, I think he has done everything possible. There is no one, either on Capitol Hill or any honest observer of whats happened, that doesnt recognize the extraordinary feats. But at some point, as Ive mentioned, this isnt a one-on-one negotiation. This is -- you know, you have to get to 216.And I dont -- I think part of this question is to go to some of those nos and ask them, what is the reason and what would you do? And the probably is, is that, as Ive mentioned before, there is this balancing act, where to get these two members, youre giving up 14. But were doing everything possible to get to that 216. And that -- I dont -- I think when you actually objectively look at the effort that was undertaken, there is no question that every single thing that has been done has been done to maximize the vote count on this.Q  And to be very, very clear -- this has been addressed a few times, but I want to get a clearer answer. You talked a lot about how this is the chance, this is an opportunity for Republicans to make good on campaign promises. I asked the President a couple days ago, what happens when you keep pushing if this fails today. And he said, well wait and -- well have to see what happens. Are you saying right now that there will be no future attempts to comply with that campaign promise if todays attempt fails?MR. SPICER: I cant say that therell never be -- and again, Im not going to be fatalistic when weve got a vote at 3:30 p.m. I know that the President has made it clear that this is the effort, this was the train thats leaving the station, and that he expects everyone -- you know, this is our opportunity. And hes got a lot left on the agenda that he wants to get done, whether its immigration, taxes, the border wall. Theres so many other things that he wants to get done that were not going to sit around and figure out -- this is the opportunity, this is the time, this is the opportunity for every member who has said that they want to repeal and replace Obamacare to put their vote in the yes column.Q  And last one. If it does pass today -- youve talked a lot about this being done in three phases, today being phase one. Phase two and phase three, one of the problems, I think, is that this is not information that is in score-able form -- the steps that Secretary Price might take, and then what may end up in this final bill. Is there any attempt being done --MR. SPICER: Well, I dont know yet. At some point, maybe it can -- I mean --Q  Can you put the administrative steps that Secretary Price --MR. SPICER: I don't know. Thats --Q  Is that something thats being attempted to be done? Because thats the kind of information I think members want.MR. SPICER: I think, right now, were focused on the vote. But I think that well have either OMB or CBO take a look at not just the other elements, but can you look at it in its totality. I don't know that thats -- but thats a good question that I can have the OMB folks address potentially with the CBO folks.Thank you, guys. Im sure well have some additional updates today. Thank you.END1:56 P.M. EDT",20596.72,-59.86000000000058,5828.74,11.050000000000182,2343.98,-1.9800000000000182

430,2017-03-24,Remarks by President Trump at Jobs  Announcement with Charter Communications,"Oval Office11:03 A.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. We greatly appreciate you being here. Im delighted to welcome Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO of Charter Communications -- a great company -- to the White House. I'm also very honored that my friend, Texas Governor Greg Abbott -- my good friend and supporter -- we love you -- is here with us today. Very appropriate. Hes done a fantastic job in Texas, and we had a previous governor who did a very good job, right? GOVERNOR ABBOTT: Right. (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT: Right. Hes around here someplace. Standing right over there.I'm very excited about the announcement we are about to make. First, some background.Five years ago Charter Communications was a struggling company that had slowly emerged from bankruptcy. Today, thanks to hard work and unbelievable leadership, truly great leadership, its the fastest-growing television, Internet, and voice company in the nation. I would say that's a good job. Not bad. Tom Rutledge and his team turned the company around, and they did it very quickly. They created a culture of customer service and excellence. And, most importantly, they brought back many jobs that had been shipped overseas -- something that's happening far too often, but we're changing that. That is very good for certain businesses but not good for the United States, not good for America, not good for our people.When American workers win, America as a country wins. We want to have companies that thrive and hire and grow right here in America. And we want them to use American workers and American citizens.Today I am thrilled to announce that Charter Communications has just committed to investing $25 billion -- with a B, $25 billion -- you're sure that's right, right? (Laughter.) With a B, right -- $25 billion here in the United States, and has committed further to hiring 20,000 American workers over the next four years. Charter has also committed to completely end its offshore call centers -- that is such a big deal -- and to base 100 percent of its call centers here in the United States -- all American jobs. This is great for their workers, its great for the customers, and it's certainly great for the United States. And you watch, it will be one of your really fantastic decisions.Tom will be opening a brand new beautiful call center in McAllen, Texas -- you know McAllen, right, good place?GOVERNOR Abbott: Great place.THE PRESIDENT: I knew you would say that -- (laughter) -- where they will create 600 new American jobs. Charters announcement follows a number of American businesses -- from Exxon to Intel to Lockheed to Boeing to many others -- that have recently announced billions of dollars in investment and thousands of jobs coming into the United States following my election victory. And by the way, thank you for your support. The Governor was a great supporter -- a great supporter. I want to thank you for -- youve done a fantastic job.We're embracing a new economic model -- the American Model. Were going to massively eliminate job-killing regulations -- that has started already, big league -- reduce government burdens, and lower taxes that are crushing American businesses and American workers all over this country. And we are really in the process of announcements and youre going to see thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs, of companies, and everything coming back into our country. And theyre coming in far faster than even I had projected.So we're honored. I'd like to have Tom Rutledge say a few words about what hes doing and about his great company. And after that, you guys can go back to healthcare. (Laughter.) MR. RUTLEDGE: Thank you, Mr. President. You know, its a great pleasure to announce these jobs. And Charter has been insourcing jobs for the last five years, and as a result of that, our company has performed tremendously. Using high-skilled, high-quality workers actually saves money. It saves money. As you know as a builder, if you do the job right the first time, its a lot less expensive than redoing it. And we found that in the service business, and we found that we can actually do better with high-quality, high-skilled American workers. And so weve been doing that, and our company was so successful that we were able to recently do a huge transaction with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks, and put together this tremendous company. And as part of that, were going to insource all the calls that Time Warner Cable outsourced -- 50 percent of their calls were leaving the country. So were going to bring all that back, and create 20,000 new jobs. And were very excited about that.And were also excited about the opportunity, in the right regulatory climate and right tax climate, to make major infrastructure investments. And were going to spend $25 billion. Were committed to spending that predicated on the kind of regulatory consistency and efficiency that we expect as a country. And so were looking forward to the opportunity to create these jobs and to build this infrastructure.And Kip Mayo, who manages our call centers, would like to tell you what were going to do in the McAllen specifically.MS. MAYO: So with the opening of the McAllen center, it gives us the capacity to be able to create over 600 good-paying jobs. That allows us to insource work that is currently performed through third parties.The McAllen center will be our first fully bilingual call center. It will allow customers who prefer to communicate with us in Spanish to do so, and we will provide them with service and technical support. We have already hired a general manager -- very qualified woman who is bilingual, and is also, coincidentally, a native McAllen. We expect to open the call center next month, and weve hired over 100 employees already, and they will be trained and they will be ready to assist our customers in just a few short weeks.So this is a very big step for us in our strategy and our plans over the course of the next few years to create jobs and to bring work in from overseas and back to the United States.MR. RUTLEDGE: And theyre good jobs, too. And theyre high-paid jobs. They have pensions. They have healthcare. Theyre the kind of jobs people want -- theyre good, solid middle-class jobs, and were proud to make them available.THE PRESIDENT: Thats great. Thank you very much, Tom. Fantastic job with the company. Unbelievable job.Id like to just close it out by asking my friend, Governor Greg Abbott to say a few words, and hell talk about the company. But hes very proud of what theyve been doing in Texas. So am I. So, Greg.GOVERNOR ABBOTT: Sure. Well, first, Im proud of you. We have a President whos living up to his campaign promise, and that is to create more jobs, but also to create more jobs by returning jobs from overseas back to the United States.I want to thank Charter Communications for the great job youre doing, but also for expanding, in the great state of Texas. Were happy that this first tranche of your expansion is in the Rio Grande Valley, in McAllen, Texas. You talked about the tax environment, the regulatory environment. Texas is number one in the nation for job creation because of the pro-business climate that we have because we have the right workforce to take care of the needs of companies like Charter Communications.So this is a win-win. Its a win for the President. Its a win for Charter. Its a win for the great state of Texas. The country is better today because of the jobs that will be created tomorrow in McAllen, Texas.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks, Greg. GOVERNOR ABBOTT: Thank you, President.THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Congratulations. Congratulations. Thank you.END11:12 A.M.

431,2017-03-24,Remarks by the President in TransCanada Keystone XL Pipeline Announcement ,"Oval OfficeTHE PRESIDENT: Thank you very much for being here this morning. Today, Im pleased to announce the official approval of the presidential permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. TransCanada will finally be allowed to complete this long overdue project with efficiency and with speed. We're working out the final details as we speak. It's going to be an incredible pipeline, greatest technology known to man or woman. And frankly, we're very proud of it.Russ Girling, President of TransCanada, is right behind me, and I'm going to have him say a few words. I know, Russ, youve been waiting for a long, long time. And I hope you don't pay your consultants anything because they had nothing to do with the approval. (Laughter.) You should ask for the hundreds of millions of dollars back that you paid them because they didnt do a damn thing except get a no vote, right? Its a great day for American jobs and a historic moment for North American and energy independence. This announcement is part of a new era of American energy policy that will lower costs for American families -- and very significantly -- reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and create thousands of jobs right here in America.And I also would like to add I think it's a lot safer to have pipelines than to use other forms of transportation for your product.When completed, the Keystone XL pipeline will span 900 miles -- wow -- and have the capacity to deliver more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day to the Gulf Coast refineries. That's some big pipeline. The fact is that this $8 billion investment in American energy was delayed for so long -- it demonstrates how our government has too often failed its citizens and companies over the past long period of time. Today, we begin to make things right and to do things right. Today we take one more step in putting the jobs, wages, and economic security of American citizens first. Put America first.As the Keystone XL pipeline now moves forward, this is just the first of many energy and infrastructure projects that my administration will approve -- and we've already approved a couple of other big ones, very, very big ones, which we'll be announcing soon -- in order to help put Americans back to work, grow our economy, and rebuild our nation.And with that, Id like to invite Russ to say a few words. Russ is a very highly respected man in the energy world. Hes President of TransCanada. And I know youll do a fantastic job, Russ, and get it up and hire plenty of American people.Thank you.MR. GIRLING: Thank you, Mr. President. And this is a very, very important day for us -- for our company. So on behalf of thousands of people that have worked very hard to get here -- as youve pointed out, very long time to get here -- but were very relieved, and very much just want to get to work. Some of those folks I have with me today -- the building trades with Sean McGarvey; some of our -- construction contractor, Quanta; our pipe suppliers from Welspun. Theres thousands of people that are just ready and itching to get to work. We got a lot of work to do in the field, but as you pointed out, this is the safest and most reliable way to move our products to market. Were going to use the best technology and be able to create thousands of jobs and important tax revenues in local communities. Thats something often thats overlooked in new projects like this, is local communities benefit greatly from these projects. It gives them tax revenues in which they can invest in schools, hospitals, roads, teachers, nurses -- all of those things -- build the fabric of communities and make those places better for those folks to live. So, again, thank you very much for this opportunity, and were not going to let you down, sir.THE PRESIDENT: Well, thank you, Russ. And I know the voters appreciate this. Some of them expressed it very, very strongly. The workers definitely appreciate it. The building trades heads didnt, but now maybe theyre going to start to. Where are my building trades guys? I think theyre going to start to, because other people were not going to be signing this bill. That I can tell you. And if it ever did get done, it would be years. But I dont think it would have ever gotten done. So we put a lot of people to work, a lot of great workers to work, and they did appreciate it. And they appreciated it, Russ, very much at the polls, as you probably noticed. And so were very happy about it.So the bottom line -- Keystone finished. Theyre going to start construction when?MR. GIRLING: Well, weve got some work to do in Nebraska to get our permits there --THE PRESIDENT: Nebraska.MR. GIRLING: -- so were looking forward to working through that local --THE PRESIDENT: Ill call Nebraska. (Laughter.) You know why? Nebraska has a great governor. They have a great governor.MR.

434,2017-03-24,Remarks by President Trump at Greek Independence Day Celebration,"East Room2:37 P.M. EDTTHE PRESIDENT: I love the Greeks. Oh, do I love the Greeks. (Laughter and applause.) Dont forget, I come from New York. That's all I see, is Greeks. They are all over the place. (Laughter.) Thank you very much, Reince. Very much appreciated. Reince was the most successful leader the RNC -- that's called the Republican National Committee -- has ever had. And now, as my really terrific and hardworking Chief of Staff, he has really one of the number-one -- and I guess you'd have to say, he's one of the top Greeks in the country. And I know a lot of them right in the audience -- they're my friends. (Applause.) And the list also includes, as you know, George Gigicos -- (applause) -- George. George is great. I said, make sure that microphone is absolutely perfect, George. He never lets me -- the Director of White House Advance. And George Sifakis -- (applause) -- where's George? And these guys are with me right from the beginning -- the Director of the Office of Public Liaison. It's a great team. It's a great, great team. Can't do any better.They helped organize this wonderful event with the Greek Archdiocese of America and so many local parishioners. And I want to thank you all. You're here, you're all over the audience. I want to thank you all.Your Eminence and Father Alex, it is a true privilege to host you at the White House. I was deeply honored to have you both at my inauguration -- it was a great day -- and I am grateful for your presence here today. I also want to thank you for awarding Reince and George the highest honor of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America -- the Medal of Saint Paul.To everyone in the youth choir who just performed -- they were beautiful. (Applause.) I heard that music. I heard that music.  With such elegance and grace, you're amazing -- you really are. Beautiful, beautiful sounds. I know you made your parents very proud. And you make all of us proud, right?Today we commemorate an event that we have marked with a national day of celebration for 30 years: Greek Independence Day. Very important. President Ronald Reagan started this wonderful tradition, and we are thrilled to continue it, and always will. Greek Independence Day celebrates the rebirth of liberty for the Greek people. It commemorates the fight for the Greek Independence that began on March 25th, 1821. After nearly 400 years of outside rule, the Greeks longed to regain their sovereignty.This love of freedom and democracy has formed a lasting bond between our two countries. It is a bond that has its origins in Ancient Greece -- the birthplace of Democracy.American President James Monroe and the great American statesman Daniel Webster both supported Greeces struggle for independence. And it was a tough, tough struggle, you know that. Then-Representative Webster honored the role of Greece in forming civilization, and said that We, like the rest of mankind, are greatly her debtors.In years to come, we dont know what will be required to defend our freedom, but we do know that it will demand great, great courage -- a courage from all of us -- and we will show it, and I have no doubt about that.Drawing inspiration from our history and those who come before, we will rise to any occasion. We have a country that, as you know, has certain difficulties, has certain problems. We will solve those problems and we will quickly solve those difficulties. Just watch. (Applause.) I want to thank you all for coming to the White House today. We celebrate Greek history, and we applaud the tremendous contributions of your people to our beloved country. May God bless you all. And with that, I would like to recognize His Eminence. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.) END2:42 P.M. EDT",20596.72,-59.86000000000058,5828.74,11.050000000000182,2343.98,-1.9800000000000182
